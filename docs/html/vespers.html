  <h3>Psalm 103</h3>
  <p>
    Bless the Lord, O my soul; O Lord my God, Thou hast been magnified exceedingly. Confession and majesty hast Thou put on, Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, Who stretchest out the heaven as it were a curtain; Who supporteth His chambers in the waters, Who appointeth the clouds for His ascent, Who walketh upon the wings of the winds, Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire, Who establisheth the earth in the sureness thereof; it shall not be turned back for ever and ever. The abyss like a garment is His mantle; upon the mountains shall the waters stand. At Thy rebuke they will flee, at the voice of Thy thunder shall they be afraid. The mountains rise up and the plains sink down, unto the place where Thou hast established them. Thou appointedst a bound that they shall not pass, neither return to cover the earth. He sendeth forth springs in the valleys; between the mountains will the waters run. They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field: the wild asses will wait to quench their thirst. Beside them will the birds of the heaven lodge, from the midst of the rocks will they give voice. He watereth the mountains from His chambers; the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of Thy works. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men, To bring forth bread out of the earth; and wine maketh glad the heart of man. To make his face cheerful with oil; and bread strengtheneth man’s heart. The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon, which Thou hast planted. There will the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hares. He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou appointedst the darkness, and there was the night, wherein all the beasts of the forest will go abroad. Young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their food from God. The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together, and they lay them down in their dens. But man shall go forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening. How magnified are Thy works, O Lord! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; the earth is filled with Thy creation. So is this great and spacious sea, therein are things creeping innumerable, small living creatures with the great. There go the ships; there this dragon, whom Thou hast made to play therein. All things wait on Thee, to give them their food in due season; when Thou givest it them, they will gather it. When Thou openest Thy hand, all things shall be filled with goodness; when Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled. Thou wilt take their spirit, and they shall cease; and unto their dust shall they return. Thou wilt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created; and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth. Let the glory of the Lord be unto the ages; the Lord will rejoice in His works, Who looketh on the earth and maketh it tremble, Who toucheth the mountains and they smoke. I will sing unto the Lord throughout my life, I will chant to my God for as long as I have my being. May my words be sweet unto Him, and I will rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners would cease from the earth, and they that work iniquity, that they should be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul.

  <h2>Lord, I Have Cried</h2>
  <div class="vespers-stichera-tone"></div>
  <h4>Psalm 140</h4>
  <p>Lord, I have cried unto Thee, hearken unto me.* Hearken unto me, O Lord.* Lord, I have cried unto Thee, hearken unto me;* attend to the voice of my supplication,* when I cry unto Thee.* Hearken unto me, O Lord.</p>
  <p>Let my prayer be set forth* as incense before Thee,* the lifting up of my hands* as an evening sacrifice.* Hearken unto me, O Lord.</p>
  <p><i class="note">And the rest of the verses are read down to the beginning of the stichoi, i.e., the point at which the stichera are inserted, unless it be a Vigil, when they are chanted.</i></p>
  <p>Set, O Lord, a watch before my mouth, and a door of enclosure round about my lips.</p>
  <p>Incline not my heart unto words of evil, to make excuse with excuses in sins.</p>
  <p>With men that work iniquity; and I will not join with their chosen.</p>
  <p>The righteous man will chasten me with mercy and reprove me; as for the oil of the sinner, let it not anoint my head.</p>
  <p>For yet more is my prayer in the presence of their pleasures; swallowed up near by the rock have their judges been.</p>
  <p>They shall hear my words, for they be sweetened; as a clod of earth is broken upon the earth, so have their bones been scattered nigh unto hades.</p>
  <p>For unto Thee, O Lord, O Lord, are mine eyes, in Thee have I hoped; take not my soul away.</p>
  <p>Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the stumblingblocks of them that work iniquity.</p>
  <p>The sinners shall fall into their own net; I am alone until I pass by.</p>
  <h4>Psalm 141</h4>
  <p>With my voice unto the Lord have I cried, with my voice unto the Lord have I made supplication.</p>
  <p>I will pour out before Him my supplication, mine affliction before Him will I declare.</p>
  <p>When my spirit was fainting within me, then Thou knewest my paths.</p>
  <p>In this way wherein I have walked they hid for me a snare.</p>
  <p>I looked upon my right hand, and beheld, and there was none that did know me.</p>
  <p>Flight hath failed me, and there is none that watcheth out for my soul.</p>
  <p>I have cried unto Thee, O Lord; I said: Thou art my hope, my portion art Thou in the land of the living.</p>
  <p>Attend unto my supplication, for I am brought very low.</p>
  <p>Deliver me from them that persecute me, for they are stronger than I.</p>
  <p class="note">And the beginning of the stichoi...</p>
  <p>Bring my soul out of prison that I may confess Thy name.</p>
  <div class="vespers-sticheron" id="10"></div>
  <p>The righteous shall wait patiently for me* until Thou shalt reward me.</p>
  <div class="vespers-sticheron" id="9"></div>
  <h4>Psalm 129</h4>
  <p>Out of the depths have I cried unto Thee, O Lord;* O Lord, hear my voice.</p>
  <div class="vespers-sticheron" id="8"></div>
  <p>Let Thine ears be attentive* to the voice of my supplication.</p>
  <div class="vespers-sticheron" id="7"></div>
  <p>If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, O Lord, who shall stand?* For with Thee there is forgiveness.</p>
  <div class="vespers-sticheron" id="6"></div>
  <p>For Thy name's sake have I patiently waited for Thee, O Lord; my soul hath waited patiently for Thy word,* my soul hath hoped in the Lord.</p>
  <div class="vespers-sticheron" id="5"></div>
  <p>From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch* let Israel hope in the Lord.</p>
  <div class="vespers-sticheron" id="4"></div>
  <p>For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption;* and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.</p>
  <div class="vespers-sticheron" id="3"></div>
  <h4>Psalm 116</h4>
  <p>O praise the Lord, all ye nations;* praise Him, all ye peoples.</p>
  <div class="vespers-sticheron" id="2"></div>
  <p>For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us,* and the truth of the Lord abideth for ever.</p>
  <div class="vespers-sticheron" id="1"></div>
  <p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.</p>
