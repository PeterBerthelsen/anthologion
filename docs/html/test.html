 <h3>
  Psalm 103
 </h3>
 <p>
  Bless the Lord, O my soul; O Lord my God, Thou hast been magnified exceedingly. Confession and majesty hast Thou put on, Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, Who stretchest out the heaven as it were a curtain; Who supporteth His chambers in the waters, Who appointeth the clouds for His ascent, Who walketh upon the wings of the winds, Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire, Who establisheth the earth in the sureness thereof; it shall not be turned back for ever and ever. The abyss like a garment is His mantle; upon the mountains shall the waters stand. At Thy rebuke they will flee, at the voice of Thy thunder shall they be afraid. The mountains rise up and the plains sink down, unto the place where Thou hast established them. Thou appointedst a bound that they shall not pass, neither return to cover the earth. He sendeth forth springs in the valleys; between the mountains will the waters run. They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field: the wild asses will wait to quench their thirst. Beside them will the birds of the heaven lodge, from the midst of the rocks will they give voice. He watereth the mountains from His chambers; the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of Thy works. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men, To bring forth bread out of the earth; and wine maketh glad the heart of man. To make his face cheerful with oil; and bread strengtheneth man's heart. The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon, which Thou hast planted. There will the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hares. He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou appointedst the darkness, and there was the night, wherein all the beasts of the forest will go abroad. Young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their food from God. The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together, and they lay them down in their dens. But man shall go forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening. How magnified are Thy works, O Lord! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; the earth is filled with Thy creation. So is this great and spacious sea, therein are things creeping innumerable, small living creatures with the great. There go the ships; there this dragon, whom Thou hast made to play therein. All things wait on Thee, to give them their food in due season; when Thou givest it them, they will gather it. When Thou openest Thy hand, all things shall be filled with goodness; when Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled. Thou wilt take their spirit, and they shall cease; and unto their dust shall they return. Thou wilt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created; and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth. Let the glory of the Lord be unto the ages; the Lord will rejoice in His works, Who looketh on the earth and maketh it tremble, Who toucheth the mountains and they smoke. I will sing unto the Lord throughout my life, I will chant to my God for as long as I have my being. May my words be sweet unto Him, and I will rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners would cease from the earth, and they that work iniquity, that they should be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul.

  <h3>
   Psalm 85
  </h3>
  A prayer of David
BOW down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor, and in misery.
Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: my God, save thy servant that putteth his
trust in thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I will call daily upon thee.
Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, art good and gracious: and of great mercy unto all them that call
upon thee.
Give ear, Lord, unto my prayer: and ponder the voice of my humble desires.
In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou hearest me.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord: there is not one that can do
as thou doest.
All nations whom thou hadst made shall come and worship thee, O Lord: and
shall glorify thy Name.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in thy truth: O knit my heart unto
thee, that I may fear thy Name.
I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and will praise thy Name for
evermore.
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the
nethermost hell.
O God, the proud are risen against me: and the congregations of naughty men
have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.
But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, plenteous
in goodness and truth.
O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength unto thy
servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.
Shew some token upon me for good, that they who hate me may see it and be
ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
  <h3>
   Psalm 86
  </h3>
  A psalm of a song for the sons of Core
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loveth the gates of Sion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Very excellent things are spoken of thee: thou city of God.
I will think upon Rahab and Babylon: with them that know me.
Behold ye the Philistines also: and they of Tyre, with the Morians; lo, there was
he born.
And of Sion it shall be reported that he was born in her: and the most High shall
stablish her.
The Lord shall rehearse it when he writeth up the people: that he was born
there.
The singers also and trumpeters shall he rehearse: All my fresh springs shall be
in thee.
  <h3>
   Psalm 87
  </h3>
  A song of a psalm for the sons of Core. For the end. Upon Maeleth, for responsive strains.
Concerning instruction for Ã†man the Israelite
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: O let my
prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling.
For my soul is full of trouble: and my life draweth nigh unto hell.
I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit: and I have been even as a
man that hath no strength.
Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded, and lie in the grave: who
are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit: in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
Thine indignation lieth hard upon me: and thou hast vexed me with all thy
storms.
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me: and made me to be
abhorred of them.
I am so fast in prison: that I cannot get forth.
My sight faileth for very trouble: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have
stretched forth my hands unto thee.
Dost thou shew wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise up again, and
praise thee?
Shall thy loving-kindness be shewed in the grave: or thy faithfulness in
destruction?
Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy righteousness in the
land where all things are forgotten?
Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come before thee.
Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face from me?
I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die: even from my youth
up thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me: and the fear of thee hath undone me.
They came round about me daily like water: and compassed me together on
every side.
My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me: and hid mine acquaintance
out of my sight.
  <h4>
   Second Stasis

  <h3>
   Psalm 88
  </h3>
  A psalm of instruction for Ã†tham the Israelite
MY SONG shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the Lord: with my mouth will I
ever be shewing thy truth from one generation to another.
For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever: thy truth shalt thou stablish in the
heavens.
I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn unto David my servant;
Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne from one generation to
another.
O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and thy truth in the
congregation of the saints.
For who is he among the clouds: that shall be compared unto the Lord?
And what is he among the gods: that shall be like unto the Lord?
God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints: and to be had in
reverence of all them that are round about him.
O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee: thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on
every side.
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.
Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it: thou hast scattered thine enemies
abroad with thy mighty arm.
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast laid the foundation of
the round world, and all that therein is.
Thou hast made the north and the south: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy
Name.
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat: mercy and truth shall go
before thy face.
Blessed is the people, O Lord, that can rejoice in thee: they shall walk in the light
of thy countenance.
Their delight shall be daily in thy Name: and in thy righteousness shall they
make their boast.
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy loving-kindness thou shalt lift
up our horns.
For the Lord is our defence: the Holy One of Israel is our King.
Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help
upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
I have found David my servant: with my holy oil have I anointed him.
My hand shall hold him fast: and my arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not be able to do him violence: the son of wickedness shall not
hurt him.
I will smite down his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.
My truth also and my mercy shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be
exalted.
I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand in the floods.
He shall call me, Thou art my Father: my God, and my strong salvation.
And I will make him my first-born: higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast with
him.
His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the days of
heaven.
But if his children forsake my law: and walk not in my judgements;
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I will visit their
offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.
Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my
truth to fail.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: I
have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David.
His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the sun before me.
He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the faithful witness in
heaven.
But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed: and art displeased at him.
Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his crown to the ground.
Thou hast overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong holds.
All they that go by spoil him: and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all his adversaries to
rejoice.
Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword: and givest him not victory in the
battle.
Thou hast put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: and covered him with dishonour.
Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever: and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
O remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men for
nought?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death: and shall he deliver his soul
from the hand of hell?
Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses: which thou swarest unto David in thy
truth?
Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I do bear in my
bosom the rebukes of many people.
Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of
thine Anointed: Praised be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

   Third Stasis

  <h3>
   Psalm 89
  </h3>
  A prayer of Moses the man of God
LORD, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of
men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a
watch in the night.
As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut down,
dried up and withered.
For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance.
For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our years to an end, as
it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong
that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but labour and
sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.
But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man feareth,
so is thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be glad all the
days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us: and for the years
wherein we have suffered adversity.
Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou the work
of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handywork.
  <h3>
   Psalm 90
  </h3>
  The praise of a song, by David
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the most High: shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty..
I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my strong hold: my God, in him
will I trust.
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome
pestilence.
He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers:
his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by
day;
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness that destroyeth
in the noon-day.
A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall
not come nigh thee.
Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold: and see the reward of the ungodly.
For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of defence very high.
There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou
tread under thy feet.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him
up, because he hath known my Name.
He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble; I will
deliver him, and bring him to honour.
With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation.

    Verse:
   </i>
   Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress, so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.

   Ðž apostles of Christ, husbandmen of the Savior, bearing the Cross upon your shoulders as a plough, and having cleared the earth made hard by the delusion of idolatry, ye sowed the word of faith. And ye are fittingly honored, Ðž holy apostles of Christ.

   Have mercy on us, Ðž Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.

    To the Martyrs:
   </i>
   Ðž most praised martyrs, spiritual lambs, reason-endowed holocausts, acceptable sacrifices well-pleasing to God: the earth could not hide thee, but heaven received thee, and ye have become communicants with the angels. With them entreat our Savior and God, we pray you, that He grant peace to the world and save our souls.
