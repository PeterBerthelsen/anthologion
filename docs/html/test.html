 <h3>
  Psalm 103
 </h3>
 <p>
  Bless the Lord, O my soul; O Lord my God, Thou hast been magnified exceedingly. Confession and majesty hast Thou put on, Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, Who stretchest out the heaven as it were a curtain; Who supporteth His chambers in the waters, Who appointeth the clouds for His ascent, Who walketh upon the wings of the winds, Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire, Who establisheth the earth in the sureness thereof; it shall not be turned back for ever and ever. The abyss like a garment is His mantle; upon the mountains shall the waters stand. At Thy rebuke they will flee, at the voice of Thy thunder shall they be afraid. The mountains rise up and the plains sink down, unto the place where Thou hast established them. Thou appointedst a bound that they shall not pass, neither return to cover the earth. He sendeth forth springs in the valleys; between the mountains will the waters run. They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field: the wild asses will wait to quench their thirst. Beside them will the birds of the heaven lodge, from the midst of the rocks will they give voice. He watereth the mountains from His chambers; the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of Thy works. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the service of men, To bring forth bread out of the earth; and wine maketh glad the heart of man. To make his face cheerful with oil; and bread strengtheneth manâ€™s heart. The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon, which Thou hast planted. There will the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock for the hares. He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou appointedst the darkness, and there was the night, wherein all the beasts of the forest will go abroad. Young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their food from God. The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together, and they lay them down in their dens. But man shall go forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening. How magnified are Thy works, O Lord! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; the earth is filled with Thy creation. So is this great and spacious sea, therein are things creeping innumerable, small living creatures with the great. There go the ships; there this dragon, whom Thou hast made to play therein. All things wait on Thee, to give them their food in due season; when Thou givest it them, they will gather it. When Thou openest Thy hand, all things shall be filled with goodness; when Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled. Thou wilt take their spirit, and they shall cease; and unto their dust shall they return. Thou wilt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created; and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth. Let the glory of the Lord be unto the ages; the Lord will rejoice in His works, Who looketh on the earth and maketh it tremble, Who toucheth the mountains and they smoke. I will sing unto the Lord throughout my life, I will chant to my God for as long as I have my being. May my words be sweet unto Him, and I will rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners would cease from the earth, and they that work iniquity, that they should be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul.
 </p>
 <p class="note">
  And Again...
 </p>
 <p>
  The sun knoweth his going down, Thou appointedst the darkness, and there was the night. How magnified are Thy works, O Lord! In wisdom hast Thou made them all.

 <p>

   Ninth Kathisma
  </h2>
  <h4>
   First Stasis
  </h4>
  <h3>
   Psalm 64
  </h3>
  For the end. A psalm and song of David
THOU, O God, art praised in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed in
Jerusalem.
Thou that hearest the prayer: unto thee shall all flesh come.
My misdeeds prevail against me: O be thou merciful unto our sins.
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: he shall dwell
in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house, even of
thy holy temple.
Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation: thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that remain in the broad sea.
Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains: and is girded about with power.
Who stilleth the raging of the sea: and the noise of his waves, and the madness of
the people.
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afraid at thy
tokens: thou that makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
praise thee.
Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very plenteous.
The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest
for the earth.
Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof: thou
makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop fatness.
They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and the little hills shall
rejoice on every side.
The folds shall be full of sheep: the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn,
that they shall laugh and sing.
  <h3>
   Psalm 65
  </h3>
  For the end. A song of a plasm of resurrection
O BE joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of his Name, make
his praise to be glorious.
Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the greatness of
thy power shall thine enemies be found liars unto thee.
For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy Name.
O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is in his doing
toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the water on foot;
there did we rejoice thereof.
He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people: and such as will
not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.
O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to slip.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our loins.
Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water, and
thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay thee my vows, which I
promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of rams: I will offer
bullocks and goats.
O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what he hath
done for my soul.
I called unto him with my mouth: and gave him praises with my tongue.
If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart: the Lord will not hear me.
But God hath heard me: and considered the voice of my prayer.
Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned his mercy from me.
  <h3>
   Psalm 66
  </h3>
  For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns
GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his countenance,
and be merciful unto us:
That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the folk righteously,
and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God, shall
give us his blessing.
God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.
  <h4>
   Second Stasis
  </h4>
  <h3>
   Psalm 67
  </h3>
  For the end. A psalm of a song of David
LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee
before him.
Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away: and like as wax
melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the presence of God.
But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them also be merry and
joyful .
O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name: magnify him that rideth upon
the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise him in his Name JAH, and
rejoice before him.
He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows: even God
in his holy habitation.
He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the
prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates continue in scarceness.
O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through
the wilderness;
The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God: even as Sinai
also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.
Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreshedst it
when it was weary.
Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness
prepared for the poor.
The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers.
Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited: and they of the household
divided the spoil.
Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove: that
is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.
When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake: then were they as white as
snow in Salmon.
As the hill of Basan, so is God's hill: even an high hill, as the hill of Basan.
Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which it pleaseth him to
dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: and the Lord
is among them, as in the holy place of Sinai.
Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for
men: yea, even for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among
them.
Praised be the Lord daily: even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his benefits
upon us.
He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is the Lord, by
whom we escape death.
God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalp of such a one as
goeth on still in his wickedness.
The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan: mine own
will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the tongue of
thy dogs may be red through the same.
It is well seen, O God, how thou goest: how thou, my God and King, goest in the
sanctuary.
The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the damsels
playing with the timbrels.
Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations: from the ground
of the heart.
There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their counsel: the
princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.
Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing, O God, that thou
hast wrought in us,
For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem: so shall kings bring presents unto thee.
When the company of the spear-men, and multitude of the mighty are scattered
abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they humbly bring pieces of
silver: and when he hath scattered the people that delight in war;
Then shall the princes come out of Eqypt: the Morians' land shall soon stretch
our her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord;
Who sitteth in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he doth send out his
voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.
Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel: his worship and strength is in the
clouds.
O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: even the God of Israel, he will give
strength and power unto his people; blessed be God.
  <h4>
   Third Stasis
  </h4>
  <h3>
   Psalm 68
  </h3>
  For the end. A Psalm of David for alternate verses
SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.
I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is: I am come into deep waters, so
that the floods run over me.
I am weary of crying; my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for waiting so long
upon my God.
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that
are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.
I paid them the things that I never took: God, thou knowest my simpleness, and
my faults are not hid from thee.
Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my cause:
let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of
Israel.
And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof: shame hath covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an alien unto my mother's
children.
For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me: and the rebukes of them that
rebuked thee are fallen upon me.
I wept, and chastened myself with fasting: and that was turned to my reproof.
I put on sackcloth also: and they jested upon me.
They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs upon
me.
But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.
Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the truth of thy salvation.
Take me out of the mire, that I sink not: O let me be delivered from them that
hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up: and let
not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable: turn thee unto me
according to the multitude of thy mercies.
And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: O haste thee, and
hear me.
Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: O deliver me, because of mine enemies.
Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are
all in thy sight.
Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to
have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.
They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and let the things that
should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.
Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not: and ever bow thou down their backs.
Pour out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold
of them.
Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they talk how they may vex
them whom thou hast wounded.
Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and not come into thy
righteousness.
Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be written among the
righteous.
As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God, shall lift me up.
I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with thanksgiving.
This also shall please the Lord: better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God, and your soul
shall live.
For the Lord heareth the poor: and despiseth not his prisoners.
Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea, and all that moveth therein.
For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah: that men may dwell there,
and have it in possession.
The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his Name
shall dwell therein.
  <h3>
   Psalm 69
  </h3>
  For the end. By David for a remembrance; that the Lord may save me
HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned
backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.
Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame: that cry over me, There,
there.
But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let all such as
delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and in misery: haste thee unto me, O God.
Thou art my helper and my redeemer: O Lord, make no long tarrying.

   Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress, so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
