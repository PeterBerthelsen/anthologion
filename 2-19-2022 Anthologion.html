<h3>Psalm 119</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN I was in trouble I called upon the Lord: and he heard me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitful tongue.
What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue: even mighty
and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.
Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech: and to have my
habitation among the tents of Kedar.
My soul hath long dwelt among them: that are enemies unto peace.
I labour for peace, but when I speak unto them thereof: they make them ready to
battle.
<h3>Psalm 120</h3>
A song of ascents
I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel: shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defence upon thy right hand.
So that the sun shall not burn thee by day: neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even he that shall keep thy
soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from this time forth for
evermore.
<h3>Psalm 121</h3>
A song of ascents
I WAS glad when they said unto me: We will go into the house of the Lord.
Our feet shall stand in thy gates: O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city: that is at unity in itself.
For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord: to testify unto Israel, to
give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.
For there is the seat of judgement: even the seat of the house of David.
O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
Peace be within thy walls: and plenteousness within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions' sakes: I will wish thee prosperity.
Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God: I will seek to do thee good.
<h3>Psalm 122</h3>
A song of ascents
UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as
the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even so our eyes wait
upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are utterly despised.
Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy: and with the
despitefulness of the proud.
<h3>Psalm 123</h3>
A song of ascents
IF THE Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say: if the Lord
himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;
They had swallowed us up quick: when thy were so wrathfully displeased at us.
Yea, the waters had drowned us: and the stream had gone over our soul.
The deep waters of the proud: had gone even over our soul.
But praised be the Lord: who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.
Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler: the snare is
broken, and we are delivered .
Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 124</h3>
A song of ascents
THEY that put their trust in the Lord shall be even as the mount Sion: which may
not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.
The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about his
people, from this time forth for evermore.
For the rod of the ungodly cometh not into the lot of the righteous: lest the
righteous put their hand unto wickedness.
Do well, O Lord: unto those that are good and true of heart.
As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness: the Lord shall lead them
forth with the evil-doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 125</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion: then were we like unto them
that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue with joy.
Then said they among the heathen: The Lord hath done great things for them.
Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already: whereof we rejoice.
Turn our captivity, O Lord: as the rivers in the south.
They that sow in tears: shall reap in joy.
He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed: shall
doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.
<h3>Psalm 126</h3>
A song of ascents
EXCEPT the Lord build the house: their labour is but lost that build it.
Except the Lord keep the city: the watchman waketh but in vain.
It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat
the bread of carefulness: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Lo, children and the fruit of the womb: are an heritage and gift that cometh of
the Lord.
Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant: even so are the young children.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed
when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
<h3>Psalm 127</h3>
A song of ascents
BLESSED are all they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: O well is thee, and happy shalt
thou be.
Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of thine house.
Thy children like the olive-branches: round about thy table.
Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the Lord.
The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shalt see Jerusalem in
prosperity all thy life long.
Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children: and peace upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 128</h3>
A song of ascents
MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up: may Israel now
say.
Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up: but they have not
prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed upon my back: and made long furrows.
But the righteous Lord: hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.
Let them be confounded and turned backward: as many as have evil will at Sion.
Let them be even as the grass growing upon the house-tops: which withereth
afore it be plucked up;
Whereof the mower filleth not his hand: neither he that bindeth up the sheaves
his bosom.
So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord prosper you: we wish you
good luck in the Name of the Lord.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 129</h3>
A song of ascents
OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.
O let thine ears consider well: the voice of my complaint.
If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss: O Lord, who may
abide it?
For there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared.
I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him: in his word is my trust.
My soul fleeth unto the Lord: before the morning watch, I say, before the
morning watch.
O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with him is
plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel: from all his sins.
<h3>Psalm 130</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, I am not high-minded: I have no proud looks.
I do not exercise myself in great matters: which are too high for me.
But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his
mother: yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.
O Israel, trust in the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 131</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, remember David: and all his trouble;
How he sware unto the Lord: and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God of Jacob;
I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house: nor climb up into my bed;
I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eye-lids to slumber: neither the
temples of my head to take any rest;
Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord: an habitation for the mighty
God of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of the same at Ephrata: and found it in the wood.
We will go into his tabernacle: and fall low on our knees before his footstool.
Arise, O Lord, into thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness: and let thy saints sing with
joyfulness.
For thy servant David's sake: turn not away the presence of thine Anointed.
The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David: and he shall not shrink from it;
Of the fruit of thy body: shall I set upon thy seat.
If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall learn them:
their children also shall sit upon thy seat for evermore.
For the Lord hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself: he hath longed for
her.
This shall be my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.
I will bless her victuals with increase: and will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will deck her priests with health: and her saints shall rejoice and sing.
There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: I have ordained a lantern for
mine Anointed.
As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame: but upon himself shall his
crown flourish.
<h3>Psalm 132</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is: brethren, to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down unto the beard:
even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts of his clothing.
Like as the dew of Hermon: which fell upon the hill of Sion.
For there the Lord promised his blessing: and life for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 133</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD now, praise the Lord: all ye servants of the Lord;
Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord: even in the courts of the house of
our God.
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary: and praise the Lord.
The Lord that made heaven and earth: give thee blessing out of Sion.

<h3>Psalm 109</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool.
The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: be thou ruler, even in the
midst among thine enemies.
In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free-will offerings with an holy
worship: the dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning.
The Lord sware, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech..
The Lord upon thy right hand: shall wound even kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places with the dead bodies:
and smite in sunder the heads over divers countries.
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up his head.
<h3>Psalm 110</h3>
Alleluia
I WILL give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart: secretly among the
faithful, and in the congregation.
The works of the Lord are great: sought out of all of them that have pleasure
therein.
His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour: and his righteousness
endureth for ever.
The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvellous works: that they
ought to be had in remembrance.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he shall ever be mindful of his
covenant.
He hath shewed his people the power of his works: that he may give them the
heritage of the heathen.
The works of his hands are verity and judgement: all his commandments are
true.
They stand fast for ever and ever: and are done in truth and equity.
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever;
holy and reverend is his Name.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all
they that do thereafter; the praise of it endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 111</h3>
Alleluia
BLESSED is the man that feareth the Lord: he hath great delight in his
commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall be
blessed.
Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth
for ever.
Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness: he is merciful, loving, and
righteous.
A good man is merciful, and lendeth: and will guide his words with discretion.
For he shall never be moved: and the righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance.
He will not be afraid of any evil tidings: for his heart standeth fast, and believeth
in the Lord.
His heart is established, and will not shrink: until he see his desire upon his
enemies.
He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor: and his righteousness
remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him: he shall gnash with his teeth,
and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.

<h3>Psalm 112</h3>
Alleluia
PRAISE the Lord, ye servants: O praise the Name of the Lord.
Blessed be the Name of the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
The Lord's Name is praised: from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of
the same.
The Lord is high above all heathen and his glory above the heavens.
Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling so high: and yet
humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?
He taketh up the simple out of the dust: and lifteth the poor out of the mire;
That he may set him with the princes: even with the princes of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house: and to be a joyful mother of
children.
<h3>Psalm 113</h3>
Alleluia
WHEN Israel came out of Egypt: and the house of Jacob from among the strange
people.
Judah was his sanctuary: and Israel his dominion.
The sea saw that, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams: and the little hills like young sheep.
What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest: and thou Jordan, that thou wast
driven back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams: and ye little hills, like young sheep?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the God of
Jacob.
Who turned the hard rock into a standing water: and the flint-stone into a
springing well.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise: for thy
loving mercy and for thy truth's sake.
Wherefore shall the heathen say: Where is now their God?
As for our God, he is in heaven: he hath done whatsoever pleased him.
Their idols are silver and gold: even the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not.
They have ears, and hear not: noses have they and smell not.
They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not: neither speak
they through their throat.
They that make them are like unto them ; and so are all such as put their trust in
them.
But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their succour and defence.
Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
Ye that fear the Lord, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
The Lord hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us: even he shall bless the
house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.
He shall bless them that fear the Lord: both small and great.
The Lord shall increase you more and more: you and your children.
Ye are the blessed of the Lord: who made heaven and earth.
All the whole heavens are the Lord's: the earth hath he given to the children of
men.
The dead praise not thee, O Lord: neither all they that go down into silence.
But we will praise the Lord: from this time forth for evermore. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 114</h3>
Alleluia
I AM well pleased: that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer.
That he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call upon him as long as I
live.
The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of hell gat hold
upon me.
I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I will call upon the Name of the Lord: O
Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea, our God is merciful
The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.
Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul: for the Lord hath rewarded thee.
And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from tears, and my
feet from falling.
I will walk before the Lord: in the land of the living.

Alleluia
I BELIEVED, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled: I said in my

What reward shall I give unto the Lord: for all the benefits that he hath done
unto me?
I will receive the cup of salvation: and call upon the Name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: right dear in the sight of
the Lord is the death of his saints.
Behold, O Lord, how that I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thine
handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the Name of
the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of all his people: in the courts of

O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: because his mercy endureth for

Let Israel now confess that he is gracious: and that his mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
Yea, let them now that fear the Lord confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
I called upon the Lord in trouble: and the Lord heard me at large.
The Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man doeth unto me.
The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire
upon mine enemies.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in man.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in princes.
All nations compassed me round about: but in the Name of the Lord will I destroy
them.
They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side: but in the
Name of the Lord will I destroy them.
They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire among the thorns:
for in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.
Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but the Lord was my help.
The Lord is my strength, and my song: and is become my salvation.
The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous: the right hand of
the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass.
The right hand of the Lord hath the pre-eminence: the right hand of the Lord
bringeth mighty things to pass.
I shall not die, but live: and declare the works of the Lord.
The Lord hath chastened and corrected me: but he hath not given me over unto
death.
Open me the gates of righteousness: that I may go into them, and give thanks
unto the Lord.
This is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into it.
I will thank thee, for thou hast heard me: and art become my salvation.
The same stone which the builders refused: is become the head-stone in the
corner.
This is the Lord's doing: and it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath made: we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Help me now, O Lord: O Lord, send us now prosperity.
Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: we have wished you good
luck , ye that are of the house of the Lord.
God is the Lord who hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, yea,
even unto the horns of the altar.
Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: thou art my God, and I will praise thee.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for ever.
