<h3>Psalm 1</h3>
BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
stood in the way of sinners: and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful.
But his delight is in the law of the Lord: and in his law will he exercise himself
day and night.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side: that will bring forth his
fruit in due season.
His leaf also shall not wither: and look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper.
As for the ungodly, it is not so with them: but they are like the chaff, which the
wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.
Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment: neither the
sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
But the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: and the way of the ungodly shall
perish.
<h3>Psalm 2</h3>
WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why do the people imagine a
vain thing?
The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together: against the
Lord, and against his Anointed.
Let us break their bonds asunder: and cast away their cords from us.
He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: the Lord shall have them
in derision.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath: and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Yet I have set my King: upon my holy hill of Sion.
I will preach the law, whereof the Lord hath said unto me: Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee.
Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance: and the
utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron: and break them in pieces like a
potter's vessel.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be learned, ye that are judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord in fear: and rejoice unto him with reverence.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way: if his wrath
be kindled, (yea, but a little,) blessed are all they that put their trust in
him.
<h3>Psalm 3</h3>
A psalm of David. When he fled from the presence of his son Absalom
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me: many are they that rise against
me.
Many one there be that say of my soul: There is no help for him in his God.
But thou, O Lord, art my defender: thou art my worship, and the lifter up of my
head.
I did call upon the Lord with my voice: and he heard me out of his holy hill.
I laid me down and slept, and rose up again: for the Lord sustained me.
I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people: that have set themselves
against me round about.
Up, Lord, and help me, O my God: for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the
cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.

<h3>Psalm 4</h3>
For the end. A song of David among the Psalms
HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast set me at liberty
when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour: and have such
pleasure in vanity, and seek after leasing?
Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that is godly: when
I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart, and in your chamber,
and be still.
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness: and put your trust in the Lord.
There be many that say: Who will shew us any good?
Lord, lift thou up: the light of thy countenance upon us.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart: since the time that their corn and wine and
oil increased.
I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest: for it is thou, Lord, only, that
makest me dwell in safety.
<h3>Psalm 5</h3>
For the end. A song of David concerning her that inherits
PONDER my words, O Lord: consider my meditation
O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King, and my God: for unto thee
will I make my prayer.
My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O Lord: early in the morning will I direct my
prayer unto thee, and will look up.
For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness: neither shall any devil
dwell with thee.
Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest all of them that
work vanity.
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor both the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude of thy
mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies: make thy way
plain before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in his mouth: their inward parts are very wickedness.
Their throat is an open sepulchre: they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own imaginations: cast
them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebelled
against thee.
And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: they shall ever be giving of
thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be
joyful in thee;
For thou, Lord, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous: and with thy favourable
kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
<h3>Psalm 6</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns for the eighth
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy
displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones are
vexed.
My soul also is sore troubled: but, Lord, how long wilt thou punish me?
Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's sake.
For in death no man remembereth thee: and who will give thee thanks in the pit?
I am weary of my groaning; every night wash I my bed: and water my couch with
my tears.
My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of all mine enemies.
Away from me, all ye that work vanity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my
weeping.
The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer.
All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed: they shall be turned back,
and put to shame suddenly.

<h3>Psalm 7</h3>
A psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the Benjamite
O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all them that
persecute me, and deliver me;
Lest he devour my soul, like a lion, and tear it in pieces: while there is none to
help.
O Lord my God, if I have done any such thing: or if there be any wickedness in
my hands;
If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me: yea, I have delivered
him that without any cause is mine enemy,
Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me: yea, let him tread my life
down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.
Stand up, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignation of
mine enemies: arise up for me in the judgement that thou hast
commanded.
And so shall the congregation of the people come about thee: for their sakes
therefore lift up thyself again.
The Lord shall judge the people; give sentence with me, O Lord: according to my
righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in me.
O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end: but guide thou the just.
For the righteous God: trieth the very hearts and reins.
My help cometh of God: who preserveth them that are true of heart.
God is a righteous Judge, strong and patient: and God is provoked every day.
If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword: he hath bent his bow, and made it
ready.
He hath prepared for him the instruments of death: he ordaineth his arrows
against the persecutors
Behold, he travaileth with mischief: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth
ungodliness.
He hath graven and digged up a pit: and is fallen on himself into the destruction
that he made for other.
For his travail shall come upon his own head: and his wickedness shall fall on his
own pate.
I will give thanks unto the Lord, according to his righteousness: and I will praise
the Name of the Lord most High.
<h3>Psalm 8</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the winepresses
O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world: thou hast set
thy glory above the heavens!
Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength,
because of thine enemies: that thou mightest still the enemy and the
avenger.
For I will consider thy heavens, even the works of thy fingers: the moon and the
stars, which thou hast ordained.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him: and the son of man, that thou visitest
him?
Thou madest him lower than the angels: to crown him with glory and worship.
Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands: and thou hast put
all things in subjection under his feet;
All sheep and oxen: yea, and the beasts of the field;
The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and whatsoever walketh through
the paths of the seas.
O Lord our Governor: how excellent is thy Name in all the world!

<h3>Psalm9</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the secrets of the Son
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will speak of all thy
marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O thou
most Highest.
While mine enemies are driven back: they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in the throne that
judgest right.
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly: thou hast put out
their name for ever and ever.
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: even as the cities which
thou hast destroyed, their memorial is perished with them.
But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath also prepared his seat for judgement.
For he shall judge the world in righteousness: and minister true judgement unto
the people.
The Lord also will be a defence for the oppressed: even a refuge in due time of
trouble.
And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast
never failed them that seek thee.
O praise the Lord which dwelleth in Sion: show the people of his doings.
For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them :and forgetteth
not the complaint of the poor.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider the trouble which I suffer of them that
hate me: thou that liftest me up from the gates of death.
That I may shew all thy praises within the ports of the daughter of Sion: I will
rejoice in thy salvation.
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the same net which they
hid privily, is their foot taken.
The Lord is known to execute judgement: the ungodly is trapped in the work of
his own hands.
The wicked shall be turned into hell: and all the people that forget God.
For the poor shall not always be forgotten: the patient abiding of the meek shall
not perish for ever.
Up, Lord, and let not man have the upper hand: let the heathen be judged in thy
sight.
Put them in fear, O Lord: that the heathen may know themselves to be but men.
Why standest thou so far off, O Lord: and hidest thy face in the needful time of
trouble?
The ungodly for his own lust doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the
crafty wiliness that they have imagined.
For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire: and speaketh good of
the covetous, whom God abhorreth.
The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God ; neither is God in all his
thoughts.
His ways are always grievous: thy judgments are far above out of his sight, and
therefore defieth he all his enemies.
For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down: there shall no
harm happen unto me.
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is ungodliness
and vanity.
He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets: and privily in his lurking
dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.
For he lieth waiting secretly, even as a lion lurketh he in his den: that he may
ravish the poor.
He doth ravish the poor: when he getteth him into his net.
He falleth down, and humbleth himself: that the congregation of the poor may
fall into the hands of his captains.
He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face, and
he will never see it.
Arise, O Lord God, and lift up thine hand: forget not the poor.
Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God: while he doth say in his heart,
Tush, thou God carest not for it.
Surely thou hast seen it: for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong.
That thou mayest take the matter into thy hand: the poor committeth himself
unto thee; for thou art the helper of the friendless.
Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious: take away his ungodliness,
and thou shalt find none.
The Lord is King for ever and ever: and the heathen are perished out of the land.
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the poor: thou preparest their heart, and
thine ear hearkeneth thereto;
To help the fatherless and poor unto their right: that the man of the earth be no
more exalted against them.
<h3>Psalm10</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
IN THE Lord put I my trust: how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a
bird unto the hill?
For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the
quiver: that they may privily shoot at them which are true of heart.
For the foundations will be cast down: and what have the righteous done?
The Lord is in his holy temple: the Lord's seat is in heaven.
His eyes consider the poor: and his eye-lids try the children of men.
The Lord alloweth the righteous: but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in
wickedness, doth his soul abhor.
Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest:
this shall be their portion to drink.
For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness: his countenance will behold the
thing that is just

<h3>Psalm11</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, upon the eighth
HELP me, Lord, for there is not one godly man left: for the faithful are minished
from among the children of men,
They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour: they do but flatter with their
lips, and dissemble in their double heart.
The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips: and the tongue that speaketh proud
things;
Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail: we are they that ought to
speak , who is lord over us?
Now for the comfortless trouble's sake of the needy: and because of the deep
sighing of the poor,
I will up, saith the Lord: and will help every one from him that swelleth against
him, and will set him at rest.
The words of the Lord are pure words: even as the silver, which from the earth is
tried, and purified seven times in the fire.
Thou shalt keep them, O Lord: thou shalt preserve him from this generation for
ever.
The ungodly walk on every side: when they are exalted, the children of men are
put to rebuke.
<h3>Psalm12</h3>
For the end, psalm of David
HOW long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever: how long wilt thou hide thy face
from me?
How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart: how long
shall mine enemies triumph over me?
Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in
death.
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: for if I be cast down, they
that trouble me will rejoice at it.
But my trust is in thy mercy: and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.
I will sing of the Lord, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me: yea, I will
praise the Name of the Lord most Highest.
<h3>Psalm13</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE fool hath said in his heart: There is no God.
They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings: there is none that
doeth good, no not one.
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there
were any that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is none that doeth good, no not one.
Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have they deceived: the
poison of asps is under their lips.
Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood.
Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they not
known ; there is no fear of God before their eyes.
Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief: eating up my
people as it were bread, and call not upon the Lord?
There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was: for God is in the
generation of the righteous.
As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor: because he putteth
his trust in the Lord.
Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turneth the
captivity of his people: then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle: or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?
Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life: and doeth the thing which is right, and
speaketh the truth from his heart.
He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour: and
hath not slandered his neighbour.
He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes: and maketh much of
them that fear the Lord.
He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not: thou it were to
his own hindrance.
He that hath not given his money upon usury: nor taken reward against the
innocent.
Whoso doeth these things: shall never fall.
<h3>Psalm15</h3>
A writing of David
PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee have I put my trust.
O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, my goods are nothing
unto thee.
All my delight is upon the saints, that are in the earth: and upon such as excel in
virtue.
But they that run after another god: shall have great trouble.
Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer: neither make mention of their
names within my lips.
The Lord himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou shalt
maintain my lot.
The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will thank the Lord for giving me warning: my reins also chasten me in the
night-season.
I have set God always before me: for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not
fall.
Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiced: my flesh also shall rest in
hope.
For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell: neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy
One to see corruption.
Thou shalt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is the fulness of joy: and at
thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.
<h3>Psalm16</h3>
A prayer of David
HEAR the right, O Lord, consider my complaint: and hearken unto my prayer,
that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence: and let thine eyes look upon the
thing that is equal.
Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night-season; thou hast tried me,
and shalt find no wickedness in me; for I am utterly purposed that my
mouth shall not offend.
Because of men's works, that are done against the words of thy lips: I have kept
me from the ways of the destroyer.
O hold thou up my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps slip not.
I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: incline thine ear to me,
and hearken unto my words.
Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which
put their trust in thee: from such as resist thy right hand.
Keep me as the apple of an eye: hide me under the shadow of thy wings.
From the ungodly that trouble me: mine enemies compass me round about to
take away my soul.
They are enclosed in their own fat: and their mouth speaketh proud things.
They lie waiting in our way on every side: turning their eyes down to the ground.
Like of a lion that is greedy of his prey: and as it were a lion's whelp. lurking in
secret places.
Up, Lord, disappoint him, and cast him down: deliver my soul from the ungodly,
which is a sword of thine;
From the men of thy hand, O Lord, from the men, I say, and from the evil world:
which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid
treasure.
They have children at their desire: and leave the rest of their substance for their
babes.
But as for me, I will behold thy presence in righteousness: and when I awake up
after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied with it."""

<h3>Psalm 17</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David the servant of the Lord. The words which he spoke to the Lord,
even the words of this song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his
enemies, and out of the hand of Saul. And he said:
I WILL love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony rock, and my
defence: my saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust, my
buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.
I will call upon the Lord, which is worthy to be praised: so shall I be safe from
mine enemies.
The sorrows of death compassed me: and the overflowings of ungodliness made
me afraid.
The pains of hell came about me: the snares of death overtook me.
In my trouble I will call upon the Lord: and complain unto my God.
So shall he hear my voice out of his holy temple: and my complaint shall come
before him, it shall enter even into his ears.
The earth trembled and quaked: the very foundations also of the hills shook, and
were removed, because he was wroth.
There went a smoke out in his presence: and a consuming fire out of his mouth,
so that coals were kindled at it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and it was dark under his feet.
He rode upon the cherubim, and did fly: he came flying upon the wings of the
wind.
He made darkness his secret place: his pavilion round about him, with dark
water and thick clouds to cover him.
At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed: hail-stones and coals of
fire.
The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hailstones and coals of fire.
He sent out his arrows, and scattered them: he cast forth lightnings, and
destroyed them.
The springs of water were seen, and the foundations of the round world were
discovered, at thy chiding, O Lord: at the blasting of the breath of thy
displeasure.
He shall send down from on high to fetch me: and shall take me out of many
waters.
He shall deliver from me my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me: for
they are too mighty for me.
They prevented me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my upholder.
He brought me forth also into a place of liberty: he brought me forth even
because he had a favour unto me.
The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing: according to the cleanness
of my hands shall he recompense me.
Because I have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not forsaken my God, as the
wicked doth.
For I have an eye unto all his laws: and will not cast out his commandments from
me.
I was also uncorrupt before him: and eschewed mine own wickedness.
Therefore shall the Lord reward me after my righteous dealing: and according
unto the cleanness of my hands in his eye-sight.
With the holy thou shalt be holy: and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.
With the clean thou shalt be clean: and with the froward thou shalt learn
frowardness.
For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity: and shalt bring down the
high looks of the proud.
Thou also shalt light my candle: the Lord my God shall make my darkness to be
light.
For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men: and with the help of my God I shall
leap over the wall.
The way of God is an undefiled way: the word of the Lord also is tried in the fire;
he is the defender of all them that put their trust in him.
For who is God, but the Lord: or who hath any strength, except our God?
It is God, that girdeth me with strength of war: and maketh my way perfect.
He maketh my feet like harts' feet: and setteth me up on high.
He teacheth mine hands to fight: and mine arms shall break even a bow of steel.
Thou hast given me the defence of my salvation: thy right hand also shall hold
me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.
Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go: that my footsteps shall not
slide.
I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them: neither will I turn again till I
have destroyed them.
I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand: but fall under my feet.
Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou shalt throw done mine
enemies under me.
Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me: and I shall
destroy them that hate me.
They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them: yea, even unto the Lord
shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.
I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I will cast them out as the
clay in the streets.
Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people: and thou shalt make me
the head of the heathen.
A people whom I have not known: shall serve me.
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: but the strange children shall
dissemble with me.
The strange children shall fail: and be afraid out of their prisons.
The Lord liveth, and blessed be my strong helper: and praised be the Lord of my
salvation.
Even the God that seeth that I be avenged: and subdueth the people unto me.
It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine
adversaries: thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.
For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles: and sing
praises unto thy Name.
Great prosperity giveth he unto his King: and showeth loving-kindness unto
David his Anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.

<h3>Psalm 18</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament showeth his
handiwork.
One day telleth another: and one night certifieth another.
There is neither speech nor language: but their voices are heard among them.
Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words into the ends of the world.
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun: which cometh forth as a
bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.
It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the
end of it again: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, converting the soul: the testimony of the
Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: the commandment of
the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever: the judgments of the Lord
are true, and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also
than honey, and the honey-comb.
Moreover, by them is thy servant taught: and in keeping of them there is great
reward.
Who can tell how oft he offendeth: O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.
Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion over

Grant thee thy heart's desire: and fulfil all thy mind.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God:

Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Anointed, and will hear him from his holy

his lips.
For thou shalt prevent him with the blessings of goodness: and shalt set a crown
of pure gold upon his head.
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life: even for ever and ever.
His honour is great in thy salvation: glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon
him.
For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity: and make him glad with the joy of thy
countenance.
And why? because the King putteth his trust in the Lord: and in the mercy of the
most Highest he shall not miscarry.
All thine enemies shall feel thine hand: thy right hand shall find out them that
hate thee.
Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: the Lord shall
destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.
Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth: and their seed from among the
children of men.
For they intended mischief against thee: and imagined such a device as they are
not able to perform.
Therefore shalt thou put them to flight: and the strings of thy bow shalt thou
make ready against the face of them.
Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so we will sing, and praise thy

<h3>Psalm 21</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the morning aid.
MY GOD, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me: and art so far from
my health, and from the words of my complaint?
O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not: and in the night-season
also I take no rest.
And thou continuest holy: O thou worship of Israel.
Our fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them.
They called upon thee, and were holpen: they put their trust in thee, and were
not confounded.
But as for me, I am a worm, and no man: a very scorn of men, and the outcast of
the people.
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot our their lips, and shake their
heads, saying,
He trusted in God, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, if he will have
him.
But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: thou wast my hope, when
I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.
I have been left unto thee ever since I was born: thou art my God, even from my
mother's womb.
O go not from me, for trouble is hard at hand: and there is none to help me.
Many oxen are come about me: fat bulls of Basan close me in on every side.
They gape upon me with their mouths: as it were a ramping and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart also in the
midst of my body is even like melting wax.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my gums: and
thou shalt bring me into the dust of death.
For many dogs are come about me: and the council of the wicked layeth siege
against me.
They pierced my hands and my feet; I may tell all my bones: they stand staring
and looking upon me.
They part my garments among them: and casts lots upon my vesture.
But be not thou far from me, O Lord: thou art my succour, haste thee to help me.
Deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth: thou hast heard me also from among the horns of
the unicorns.
I will declare thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I
praise thee.
O praise the Lord, ye that fear him: magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob, and
fear him, all ye seed of Israel.
For he hath not despised, nor abhorred, the low estate of the poor: he hath not
hid his face from him, but when he called unto him he heard him.
My praise is of thee in the great congregation: my vows will I perform in the
sight of them that fear him.
The poor shall eat and be satisfied: they that seek after the Lord shall praise him;
your heart shall live for ever.
All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned unto the
Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him.
For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the Governor among the people.
All such as be fat upon earth: have eaten and worshipped.
All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him: and no man hath
quickened his own soul.
My seed shall serve him: they shall be counted unto the Lord for a generation.
They shall come, and the heavens shall declare his righteousness: unto a people
that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.
<h3>Psalm 22</h3>
A psalm of David
THE Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside the waters of
comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness, for
his Name's sake.
Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort me.
Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble me: thou hast
anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.
But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
<h3>Psalm 23</h3>
A psalm of David on the first day of the week
THE earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and
they that dwell therein.
For he hath founded it upon the seas: and prepared it upon the floods.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall rise up in his holy place?
Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart: and that hath not lift up his
mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord: and righteousness from the God of
his salvation.
This is the generation of them that seek him: even of them that seek thy face, O
Jacob.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: it is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty
in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: even the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.

<h3>Psalm 24</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my trust in thee: O
let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.
For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed: but such as transgress
without a cause shall be put to confusion.
Shew me thy ways, O Lord: and teach me thy paths.
Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God of my salvation; in
thee hath been my hope all the day long.
Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender mercies: and thy loving-kindnesses,
which have been ever of old.
O remember not the sins and offences of my youth: but according to thy mercy
think thou upon me, O Lord, for thy goodness.
Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Them that are meek shall he guide in judgement: and such as are gentle, them
shall he learn his way.
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth: unto such as keep his covenant
and his testimonies.
For thy Name's sake, O Lord: be merciful unto my sin, for it is great.
What man is he that feareth the Lord: him shall he teach in the way that he shall
choose.
His soul shall dwell at ease: and his seed shall inherit the land.
The secret of the Lord is among them that fear him: and he will show them his
covenant.
Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out of the
net.
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am desolate and in misery.
The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my troubles.
Look upon my adversity and misery: and forgive me all my sin.
Consider mine enemies, how many they are: and they bear a tyrannous hate
against me.
O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be confounded, for I have put my
trust in thee.
Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me: for my hope hath been in
thee.
Deliver Israel, O God: out of all his troubles.
<h3>Psalm 25</h3>
A psalm of David
BE THOU my judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently: my trust hath been
also in the Lord, therefore shall I not fall.
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me: try out my reins and my heart.
For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes: and I will walk in thy truth.
I have not dwelt with vain persons: neither will I have fellowship with the
deceitful.
I have hated the congregation of the wicked: and will not sit among the ungodly.
I will wash my hands in innocency, O Lord: and so will I go to thine altar.
That I may show the voice of thanksgiving: and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house: and the place where thine honour
dwelleth.
O shut not up my soul with the sinners: nor my life with the blood-thirsty.
In whose hands is wickedness: and their right hand is full of gifts.
But as for me, I will walk innocently: O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.
My foot standeth right: I will praise the Lord in the congregations.
<h3>Psalm 26</h3>
A psalm of David before he was anointed
THE Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom then shall I fear: the Lord is the
strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my
flesh: they stumbled and fell.
Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid:
and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.
One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may dwell
in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of
the Lord, and to visit his temple.
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle: yea, in the secret
place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone.
And now shall he lift up mine head: above mine enemies round about me.
Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness: I will sing,
and speak praises unto the Lord.
Hearken unto my voice, O Lord, when I cry unto thee: have mercy upon me, and
hear me.
My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: Thy face, Lord, will I seek.
O hide not thou thy face from me: nor cast thy servant away in displeasure.
Thou hast been my succour: leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me: the Lord taketh me up.
Teach me the way, O Lord: and lead in the right way, because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: for there are false
witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.
I should utterly have fainted: but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the
Lord in the land of the living.
O tarry thou the Lord's leisure: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart ; and
put thou thy trust in the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 27</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee will I cry, O Lord my strength: think no scorn of me; lest, if thou
make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go down into the
pit.
Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee: when I hold up my
hands towards the mercy-seat of thy holy temple.
O pluck me not away, neither destroy me, with the ungodly and wicked doers:
which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mischief in their
hearts.
Reward them according to their deeds: and according to the wickedness of their
own inventions.
Recompense them after the work of their hands: pay them that they have
deserved.
For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his
hands: therefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.
Praised be the Lord: for he hath heard the voice of my humble petitions.
The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and I am
helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise
him.
The Lord is my strength: and he is the wholesome defence of his Anointed.
O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: feed them , and
set them up for ever.
<h3>Psalm 28</h3>
A psalm of David on the occasion of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle
BRING unto the Lord, O ye mighty, bring young rams unto the Lord: ascribe unto
the Lord worship and strength.
Give the Lord the honour due unto his Name: worship the Lord with holy
worship.
It is the Lord that commandeth the waters: it is the glorious God that maketh the
thunder.
It is the Lord that ruleth the sea; the voice of the Lord is mighty in operation: the
voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar-trees: yea, the Lord breaketh the
cedars of Libanus.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf: Libanus also, and Sirion, like a young
unicorn.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the Lord shaketh
the wilderness: yea, the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Cades.
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and discovereth the
thick bushes: in his temple doth every man speak of his honour.
The Lord sitteth above the water -flood: and the Lord remaineth a King for ever.
The Lord shall give strength unto his people: the Lord shall give his people the
blessing of peace.
<h3>Psalm 29</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song at the dedication of the house of David
I WILL magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up: and not made my foes to
triumph over me.
O Lord my God, I cried unto thee: and thou hast healed me.
Thou, Lord, hast brought my soul out of hell: thou hast kept my life from them
that go down to the pit.
Sing praises unto the Lord, O ye saints of his: and give thanks unto him for a
remembrance of his holiness.
For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his pleasure is life:
heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: thou, Lord, of thy
goodness hast made my hill so strong.
Thou didst turn thy face from me: and I was troubled.
Then cried I unto thee, O Lord: and gat me to my Lord right humbly.
What profit is there in my blood: when I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust give thanks unto thee: or shall it declare thy truth?
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.
Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and
girded me with gladness.
Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing: O my God, I
will give thanks unto thee for ever.

For the end. A psalm of David; an utterance of extreme fear
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion, deliver
me in thy righteousness.
Bow down thine ear to me: make haste to deliver me.
And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence: that thou mayest save me.
For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: be thou also my guide, and lead me
for thy Name's sake.
Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my
strength.
Into thy hands I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou
God of truth.
I have hated them that hold of superstitious vanities: and my trust hath been in
the Lord.
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble, and
hast known my soul in adversities.
Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: but hast set my feet in a
large room.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord , for I am in trouble: and mine eye is consumed for
very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.
For my life is waxen old with heaviness: and my years with mourning.
My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity: and my bones are consumed.
I became a reproof among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours: and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me; and they
that did see me without conveyed themselves from me.
I am clean forgotten, as a dead man out of mind: I am become like a broken
vessel.
For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude: and fear is on every side, while
they conspire together against me, and take their counsel to take away my
life.
But my hope hath been in thee, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my God.
My time is in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies: and from
them that persecute me.
Shew thy servant the light of thy countenance: and save me for thy mercy's sake.
Let me not be confounded, O Lord for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be
put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.
Let the lying lips be put to silence: which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully,
speak against the righteous.
O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee:
and that thou hast prepared for them that put their trust in thee, even
before the sons of men!
Thou shalt hide them privily by thine own presence from the provoking of all
men: thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle from the strife of
tongues.
Thanks be to the Lord: for he hath shewed me marvellous great kindness in a
strong city.
And when I made haste, I said: I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.
Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer: when I cried unto thee.
26.O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth them that are
faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.
Be strong, and he shall establish your heart: all that ye put your trust in the
Lord.
<h3>Psalm 31</h3>
A psalm of instruction by David
BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven: and whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no sin: and in whose spirit
there is no guile.
For while I held my tongue: my bones consumed away through my daily
complaining.
For thy hand is heavy upon me day and night: and my moisture is like the
drought in summer.
I will acknowledge my sin unto thee: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.
I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord: and so thou forgavest the wickedness
of my sin.
For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a time when
thou mayest be found: but in the great water-floods they shall not come
nigh him.
Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shalt preserve me from trouble: thou shalt
compass me about with songs of deliverance.
I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go: and I will
guide thee with mine eyes.
Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding: whose mouths
must be held with bit and bridle. lest they fall upon thee.
Great plagues remain for the ungodly: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord,
mercy embraceth him on every side.
Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord: and be joyful, all ye that are true
of heart.

REJOICE in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to be thankful.
Praise the Lord with harp: sing praises unto him with the lute, and instrument of
ten strings.
Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing praises lustily unto him with a good
courage.
For the word of the Lord is true: and all his works are faithful.
He loveth righteousness and judgement: the earth is full of the goodness of the
Lord.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the hosts of them by the
breath of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap: and layeth
up the deep, as in a treasure-house.
Let all the earth fear the Lord: stand in awe of him, all ye that dwell in the world.
For he spake, and it was done: he commanded and it stood fast.
The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: and maketh the devices
of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the counsels of princes.
The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever: and the thoughts of his heart from
generation to generation.
Blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord Jehovah: and blessed are the folk,
that he hath chosen to him to be his inheritance.
The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the children of men: from the
habitation of his dwelling he considereth all them that dwell on the earth.
He fashioneth all the hearts of them: and understandeth all their works.
There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host: neither is any
mighty man delivered by much strength.
A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man: neither shall he deliver any
man by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him: and upon them that put
their trust in his mercy.
To deliver their soul from death: and to feed them in the time of dearth.
Our soul hath patiently tarried for the Lord: for he is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in him: because we have hoped in his holy Name.
Let thy merciful kindness, O Lord, be upon us: like as we do put our trust in thee.

They had an eye unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
ashamed.
Lo, the poor crieth, and the Lord heareth him: yea, and saveth him out of all his
troubles.
The angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him: and delivereth

O taste, and see, how gracious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusteth in
him.
O fear the Lord, ye that are his saints: for they that fear him lack nothing.
The lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they who seek the Lord shall want no
manner of thing that is good.
Come, ye children, and hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
What man is he that lusteth to live: and would fain see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil: and thy lips, that they speak no guile.
Eschew evil, and do good: seek peace, and ensue it.
The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous: and his ears are open unto their
prayers.
The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil: to root out the
remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them: and delivereth them out of all
their troubles.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and will save such as be
of an humble spirit.
Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of all.
He keepeth all his bones: so that not one of them is broken.
But misfortune shall slay the ungodly: and they that hate the righteous shall be
desolate.
The Lord delivereth the souls of his servants: and all they that put their trust in
him shall not be destitute.

Let them be as the dust before the wind: and the angel of the Lord scattering

Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord persecute them.
For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause: yea, even

Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net, that he hath laid
privily, catch himself: that he may fall into his own mischief.
And, my soul, be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his salvation.

But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the
very abjects came together against me unawares, making mouths at me,

With the flatterers were busy mockers: who gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, how long wilt though look upon this: O deliver my soul from the calamities
which they bring on me, and my darling from the lions.
So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among
much people.
O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly: neither let them
wink with their eyes that they hate me without a cause.
And why? their communing is not for peace; but they imagine deceitful words
against them that are quiet in the land.
They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said: Fie on thee, fie on thee, we
saw it with our eyes.
This thou hast seen, O Lord: hold not thy tongue then, go not far from me, O
Lord.
Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel: avenge thou my cause, my God, and
my Lord.
Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness: and let them not
triumph over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, There, there, so would we have it: neither let
them say, We have devoured him.
Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at my trouble: let
them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that boast themselves against
me.
Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing: yea, let them say

He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good way:
neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.

Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: thy judgments are like the
great deep.
Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast; How excellent is thy mercy, O God:
and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy
wings.
They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house: and thou shalt give
them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.
For with thee is the well of life: and in thy light shall we see light.
O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee: and thy
righteousness unto them that are true of heart.
O let not the foot of pride come against me: and let not the hand of the ungodly

counsels.
Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: fret not thyself, else shalt thou be
moved to do evil.
Wicked doers shall be rooted out: and they that patiently abide the Lord, those
shall inherit the land.
Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: thou shalt look after his
place, and he shall be away.
But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth: and shall be refreshed in the
multitude of peace.
The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just: and gnasheth upon him with his
teeth.
The Lord shall laugh him to scorn: for he hath seen that his day is coming.
The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow: to cast down
the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of a right conversation.
Their sword shall go through their own heart: and their bow shall be broken.
A small thing that the righteous hath: is better than great riches of the ungodly.
For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken: and the Lord upholdeth the
righteous.
The Lord knoweth the days of the godly: and their inheritance shall endure for
ever.
They shall not be confounded in the perilous time: and in the days of dearth they
shall have enough.
As for the ungodly, they shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord shall consume
as the fat of lambs: yea, even as the smoke shall they consume away.
The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous is merciful and
liberal.
Such as are blessed of God shall possess the land: and they that are cursed of
him shall be rooted out.
The Lord ordereth a good man's going: and maketh his way acceptable to
himself.
Though he fall, he shall not be cast away: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
hand.
I have been young, and now am old: and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging their bread.
The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth: and his seed is blessed.
Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good: and dwell for evermore.
For the Lord loveth the thing that is right: he forsaketh not his that be godly, but
they are preserved for ever.
The unrighteous shall be punished: as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be
rooted out.
The righteous shall inherit the land: and dwell therein forever.
The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and his tongue will be talking
of judgement.
The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not slide.
The ungodly seeth the righteous: and seeketh occasion to slay him.
The Lord will not leave him in his hand: nor condemn him when he is judged.
Hope thou in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee, that thou
shalt possess the land: when the ungodly shall perish, thou shalt see it.
I myself have seen the ungodly in great power: and flourishing like a green baytree.
I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him, but his place could no where be
found.
Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right: for that shall bring a
man peace at the last.
As for the transgressors, they shall perish together: and the end of the ungodly
is, they shall be rooted out at the last.
But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord: who is also their strength
in the time of trouble.
And the Lord shall stand by them, and save them: he shall deliver them from the
ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him.

<h3>Psalm 37</h3>
A psalm of David . For remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day
PUT me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy heavy
displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me: and thy hand presseth me sore.
There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure: neither is there any
rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.
For my wickednesses are gone over my head: and are like a sore burden, too
heavy for me to bear.
My wounds stink, and are corrupt: through my foolishness.
I am brought into so great trouble and misery: that I go mourning all the day
long.
For my loins are filled with a sore disease: and there is no whole part in my body.
I am feeble, and sore smitten: I have roared for the very disquietness of my
heart.
Lord, thou knowest all my desire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me: and the sight of mine eyes is gone
from me.
My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble: and my
kinsmen stood afar off.
They also that sought after my life laid snares for me: and they that went about
to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit all the day long.
As for me I was like a deaf men, and heard not: and as one that is dumb, who
doth not open his mouth.
I became even as a man that heareth not: and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my
God.
I have required that they, even mine enemies should not triumph over me: for
when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me.
And I, truly, am set in the plague: and my heaviness is ever in my sight.
For I will confess my wickedness: and be sorry for my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are mighty: and they that hate me wrongfully are
many in number.
They also that reward evil for good are against me: because I follow the thing
that good is.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me.
Haste thee to help me: O Lord God of my salvation.
<h3>Psalm 38</h3>
For the end. A song of David, for Idithun
I SAID, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not in my tongue.
I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle: while the ungodly is in my sight.
I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even from good words;
but it was pain and grief to me.
My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire kindled: and at
the last I spake with my tongue;
Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may be certified
how long I have to live.
Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long: and mine age is even as
nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is altogether vanity.
For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth
up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.
And now, Lord, what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.
Deliver me from all mine offences: and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.
I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.
Take thy plague away from me: I am even consumed by the means of thy heavy
hand.
When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to
consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man
therefore is but vanity.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling: hold not thy
peace at my tears.
For I am a stranger with thee: and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence, and be no
more seen
<h3>Psalm 39</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
I WAITED patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and heard my calling.
He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay: and set my
feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth: even a thanksgiving unto our God.
Many shall see it, and fear: and shall put their trust in the Lord.
Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the Lord: and turned not unto the
proud, and to such as go about with lies.
O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like as be
also thy thoughts which are to us-ward: and yet there is no man that
ordereth them unto thee:
If I should declare them, and speak of them: they should be more than I am able
to express.
Sacrifice and meat-offering thou wouldest not: but mine ears hast thou opened.
Burnt-offerings, and sacrifice for sin, hast thou not required: then said I, Lo, I
come,
In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil thy will, O my
God: I am content to do it; yea, thy law is within my heart.
I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I will not refrain
my lips, O Lord, and that thou knowest.
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart: my talk hath been of thy truth
and of thy salvation.
I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth: from the great congregation.
Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord: let thy loving-kindness and thy
truth alway preserve me.
For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such hold upon
me that I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the
hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.
O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me: make haste, O Lord, to help me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after my soul to
destroy it: let them be driven backward and put to rebuke, that wish me
evil.
Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame: that say unto me, Fie upon
thee, fie upon thee.
Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let such as love thy
salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and needy: but the Lord careth for me.
Thou art my helper and redeemer: make no long tarrying, O my God.

<h3>Psalm 40</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him
in the time of trouble.
The Lord preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth:
and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.
The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick upon his bed: make thou all his bed in
his sickness.
I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies speak evil of me: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: and his heart conceiveth falsehood
within himself, and when he cometh forth he telleth it.
All mine enemies whisper together against me: even against me do they imagine
this evil.
Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him: and now that he lieth, let him
rise up no more.
Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted: who did also eat of my
bread, hath laid great wait for me.
But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord: raise thou me up again, and I shall reward
them.
By this I know thou favourest me: that mine enemy doth not triumph against me.
And when I am in my health, thou upholdest me: and shalt set me before thy face
for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: world without end. Amen.

For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: when shall I come to
appear before the presence of God?
My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where
is now thy God?
Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the
multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;
In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day.
Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted
within me?
Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his
countenance.
My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore will I remember thee concerning
the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermon.
One deep calleth another, because of the noise of the water-pipes: all thy waves
and storms are gone over me.
The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time: and in the nightseason did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me: why go I
thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword: while mine enemies that trouble
me cast me in the teeth;
Namely, while they say daily unto me: Where is now thy God?
Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.
<h3>Psalm 42</h3>
A psalm of David
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people:
O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.
For thou art the God of my strength, why hast thou put me from thee: and why
go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me: and bring me unto thy
holy hill, and to thy dwelling.
And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and
gladness: and upon the harp I will give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.

<h3>Psalm 43</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
WE HAVE heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us: what thou hast
done in their time of old;
How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted them in: how
thou hast destroyed the nations and cast them out.
For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword: neither was it
their own arm that helped them;
But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance: because
thou hadst a favour unto them.
Thou art my King, O God: send help unto Jacob.
Through thee will we overthrow our enemies: and in thy Name will we tread
them under, that rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow: it is not my sword that shall help me;
But it is thou that savest us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion that
hate us.
We make our boast of God all day long: and will praise thy Name for ever.
But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion: and goest not forth with our
armies.
Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies: so that they which hate us
spoil our goods.
Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep: and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Thou sellest thy people for nought: and takest no money for them.
Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours: to be laughed to scorn, and had
in derision of them that are round about us.
Thou makest us to be a by-word among the heathen: and that the people shake
their heads at us.
My confusion is daily before me: and the shame of my face hath covered me;
For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer: for the enemy and avenger.
And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee: nor behave
ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.
Our heart is not turned back: neither our steps gone out of thy way;
No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons: and covered us with
the shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to any
strange God: shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very secrets of
the heart.
For thy sake also are we killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep
appointed to be slain.
Up, Lord, why sleepest thou: awake, and be not absent from us for ever.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face: and forgettest our misery and trouble?
For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
ground.
Arise, and help us: and deliver us for thy mercy's sake.
<h3>Psalm 44</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses by the sons of Core, for instruction. A Song concerning the
beloved
MY HEART is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the thing which I have made
unto the King.
My tongue is the pen: of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, because God
hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most Mighty: according to thy
worship and renown.
Good luck have thou with thine honour: ride on, because of the word of truth , of
meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible
things.
Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be subdued unto thee: even in
the midst among the King's enemies.
Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, even thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia: out of the ivory palaces,
whereby they have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did
stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, incline thine ear ; forget also thine own
people, and thy father's house.
So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty: for his is thy Lord God, and
worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: like as the rich also among
the people shall make their supplication before thee.
The King's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work: the virgins that be
her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee.
With joy and gladness shall they be brought: and shall enter into the King's
palace.
Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children: whom thou mayest make princes
in all lands.
I will remember thy Name from one generation to another: therefore shall the
people give thanks unto thee, world without end.
<h3>Psalm 45</h3>
For the end. For the sons of Core; a psalm concerning secret things
GOD is our hope and strength: a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved: and though the hills be
carried into the midst of the sea;
Though the waters thereof rage and swell: and though the mountains shake at
the tempest of the same.
The rivers of the flood thereof shall make glad the city of God: the holy place of
the tabernacle of the most Highest.
God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed: God shall help
her, and that right early.
The heathen make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved: but God hath shewed
his voice, and the earth shall melt away.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.
O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord: what destruction he hath
brought upon the earth.
He maketh wars to cease in all the world: he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the
spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.
Be still then, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I
will be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

refuge.
For lo, the kings of the earth: are gathered, and gone by together.
They marvelled to see such things: they were astonished, and suddenly cast

city of our God: God upholdeth the same for ever.
We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God: in the midst of thy temple.
O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's end: thy right
hand is full of righteousness.
Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad: because of thy
judgements.
Walk about Sion, and go round about her: and tell the towers thereof.
Mark well her bulwarks, set up her houses: that ye may tell them that come
after.

<h3>Psalm 48</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O HEAR ye this, all ye people: ponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the
world;
High and low, rich and poor: one with another.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom: and my heart shall muse of understanding.
I will incline mine ear to the parable: and shew my dark speech upon the harp.
Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness: and when the wickedness of
my heels compasseth me round about?
There be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches.
But no man may deliver his brother: nor make agreement unto God for him;
For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that alone for ever;
Yea, though he live long: and see not the grave.
For he seeth that wise men also die, and perish together: as well as the ignorant
and foolish, and leave their riches for other.
And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever: and that their
dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the
lands after their own names.
Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour: seeing that he may be compared
unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them.
This is their foolishness: and their posterity praise their saying.
They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and the righteous shall
have domination over them in the morning: their beauty shall consume in
the sepulchre out of their dwelling.
But God hath delivered my soul from the place of hell: for he shall receive me.
Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich: or if the glory of his house be
increased.
For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth: neither shall his pomp
follow him.
For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man: and so long as thou doest
well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.
He shall follow the generation of his fathers: and shall never see light.
Man being in honour hath no understanding: but is compared unto the beasts
that perish.

And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is Judge himself.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak: I myself will testify against thee, O Israel;
for I am God, even thy God.
I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt-offerings:

I will take no bullock out of thine house: nor he-goat out of thy folds.
For all the beasts of the forest are mine: and so are the cattle upon a thousand

Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh: and drink the blood of goats?
Offer unto God thanksgiving: and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.
And call upon me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise

But unto the ungodly said God: Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my
covenant in thy mouth;
Whereas thou hatest to be reformed: and has cast my words behind thee?
When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him: and hast been partaker
with the adulterers.
Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness: and with thy tongue thou hast set
forth deceit.
Thou satest, and spakest against thy brother: yea, and hast slandered thine own
mother's son.
These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest
wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and
set before thee the things that thou hast done.
O consider this, ye that forget God: lest I pluck you away, and there be none to
deliver you.
Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation right will I shew the salvation of God.

For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.
Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin hath my mother conceived me.
But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand
wisdom secretly.
Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice.
Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.
Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health: and
my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.
Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy praise.
For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou delightest not in
burnt-offerings.
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt
thou not despise.
O be favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.

Lo, then would I get me away far off: and remain in the wilderness.

Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them: for I have spied unrighteousness
and strife in the city.
Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow
are in the midst of it.
Wickedness is therein: deceit and guile go not out of their streets.
For it is not an open enemy, that hath done me this dishonour: for then I could
have borne it.
Neither was it mine adversary, that did magnify himself against me: for then
peradventure I would have hid myself from him.
But it was even thou, my companion: my guide, and mine own familiar friend.
We took sweet counsel together: and walked in the house of God as friends.
Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for
wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord shall save me.
In the evening, and morning, and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly: and
he shall hear my voice.
It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
for there were many with me.
Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them down: for
they will not turn, nor fear God.
He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him: and he brake his covenant.
The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart: his
words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very swords.
O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: and shall not suffer
the righteous to fall for ever.
And as for them: thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction.
The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days:
nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.

I will praise God, because of his word: I have put my trust in God, and will not
fear what flesh can do unto me.
They daily mistake my words: all that they imagine is to do me evil.
They hold all together, and keep themselves close: and mark my steps, when
they lay wait for my soul.
Shall they escape for their wickedness: thou, O God, in thy displeasure shalt cast
them down.
Thou tellest my flittings; put my tears into thy bottle: are not these things noted
in thy book?
Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight: this I
know; for God is on my side.
In God's word I will rejoice: in the Lord's word will I comfort me.
Yea, in God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows: unto thee will I give thanks.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling: that I may
walk before God in the light of the living.
<h3>Psalm 56</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David, for a memorial. When he fled from the presence of Saul to

BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, be merciful unto me, for my soul trusteth in
thee: and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until this
tyranny be over-past.
I will call unto the most high God: even unto the God that shall perform the
cause which I have in hand.
He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him that would eat
me up.
God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among lions.
And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are
spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they have digged a
pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, and give praise.
Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee
among the nations.
For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens: and thy truth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 57</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation: and do ye judge the
thing that is right, O ye sons of men?
Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth: and your hands deal with
wickedness.
The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb: as soon as they are
born, they go astray, and speak lies.
They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent: even like the deaf adder that
stoppeth her ears.
Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer: charm he never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; smite the jaw-bones of the lions, O
Lord: let them fall away like water that runneth apace; and when they
shoot their arrows let them be rooted out.
Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of a woman:
and let them not see the sun.
Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns: so let indignation vex him, even as a
thing that is raw.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his
footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: doubtless
there is a God that judgeth the earth.

For the end. Destroy not: By David for a memorial, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill

DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God: defend me from them that rise up
against me.
O deliver me from the wicked doers: and save me from the blood-thirsty men.
For lo, they lie waiting for my soul: the mighty men are gathered against me,
without any offence or fault of me, O Lord.
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: arise thou therefore to help
me, and behold.
Stand up, O Lord God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the heathen: and be
not merciful unto them that offend of malicious wickedness.
They go to and fro in the evening: they grin like a dog, and run about through the
city.
Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips: for who doth
hear?
But thou. O Lord, shalt have them in derision: and thou shalt laugh all the
heathen to scorn.
My strength will I ascribe unto thee: for thou art the God of my refuge.
God sheweth me his goodness plenteously: and God shall let me see my desire
upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget it: but scatter them abroad among the
people, and put them down, O Lord, our defence.
For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be taken in
their pride: and why? their preaching is of cursing and lies.
Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish: and know that
it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.
And in the evening they will return: grin like a dog, and will go about the city.
They will run here and there for meat: and grudge if they be not satisfied.
As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betimes in the
morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
trouble.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my
merciful God.
<h3>Psalm 59</h3>
For the end. For them that shall yet be changed. For an inscription by David for instruction.
When he had burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syrian Sobal, and Joab had returned and smitten
twelve thousand in the Valley of Salt
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad: thou hast also been
displeased; O turn thee unto us again.
Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: heal the sores thereof, for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewed thy people heavy things: thou hast given us a drink of deadly
wine.
Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee: that they may triumph because of
the truth.
Therefore were thy beloved delivered: help me with thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Sichem: and mete out
the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head;
Judah is my law-giver.
Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, be thou glad
of me.
Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou cast us out, O God: wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
O be thou our help in trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Through God will we do great acts: for it is he that shall tread down our enemies.

a strong tower for me against the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: and my trust shall be under the covering of
thy wings.
For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires: and hast given an heritage unto those
that fear thy Name.
Thou shalt grant the King a long life: that his years may endure throughout all
generations.
He shall dwell before God for ever: O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness,
that they may preserve him.
So will I always sing praise unto thy Name: that I may daily perform my vows.

MY SOUL truly waiteth still upon God: for of him cometh my salvation.

greatly fall.
How long will ye imagine mischief against every man: ye shall be slain all the
sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and like a broken hedge.
Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt: their delight is in
lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse with their heart.
Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God: for my hope is in him.
He truly is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
fall.
In God is my health, and my glory: the rock of my might, and in God is my trust.
O put your trust in him alway, ye people: pour out your hearts before him, for
God is our hope.
As for the children of men, they are but vanity: the children of men are deceitful
upon the weights, they are altogether lighter than vanity itself.
O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselves unto vanity: if riches
increase, set not your heart upon them.

A psalm of David. When he was in the wilderness of Idumea
O GOD, thou art my God: early will I seek thee.
My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee: in a barren and dry
land where no water is.
Thus have I looked for thee in holiness: that I might behold thy power and glory.
For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: my lips shall praise thee.
As long as I live will I magnify thee on this manner: and lift up my hands in thy
Name.
My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness: when my
mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.
Have I not remembered thee in my bed: and thought upon thee when I was
waking?
Because thou hast been my helper: therefore under the shadow of thy wings will
I rejoice.
My soul hangeth upon thee: thy right hand hath upholden me.
These also that seek the hurt of my soul: they shall go under the earth.
Let them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be a portion for foxes.
But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him shall be
commended: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
<h3>Psalm 63</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the gathering together of the froward: and from the insurrection of
wicked doers;
Who have whet their tongue like a sword: and shoot out their arrows, even bitter
words;
That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: suddenly do they hit him, and
fear not.
They encourage themselves in mischief: and commune among themselves how
they may lay snares, and say that no man shall see them.
They imagine wickedness, and practise it: that they keep secret among
themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.
But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow: that they shall be
wounded.
Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall insomuch that whoso seeth them
shall laugh them to scorn.
And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done: for they shall perceive that
it is his work.
The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and put his trust in him: and all they that
are true of heart shall be glad.

Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: he shall dwell

Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our

They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afraid at thy

Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very plenteous.
The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest

Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof: thou
makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop fatness.

For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy Name.
O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is in his doing

He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the water on foot;
there did we rejoice thereof.
He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people: and such as will
not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.
O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to slip.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our loins.
Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water, and
thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay thee my vows, which I
promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of rams: I will offer
bullocks and goats.
O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what he hath
done for my soul.

melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the presence of God.
But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them also be merry and

He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows: even God
in his holy habitation.
He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the
prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates continue in scarceness.
O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through
the wilderness;
The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God: even as Sinai
also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.
Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreshedst it
when it was weary.
Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness
prepared for the poor.

Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which it pleaseth him to
dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: and the Lord

Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for
men: yea, even for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among
them.
Praised be the Lord daily: even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his benefits
upon us.
He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is the Lord, by
whom we escape death.
God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalp of such a one as
goeth on still in his wickedness.
The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan: mine own
will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the tongue of
thy dogs may be red through the same.
It is well seen, O God, how thou goest: how thou, my God and King, goest in the
sanctuary.
The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the damsels
playing with the timbrels.
Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations: from the ground
of the heart.
There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their counsel: the
princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.
Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing, O God, that thou
hast wrought in us,
For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem: so shall kings bring presents unto thee.
When the company of the spear-men, and multitude of the mighty are scattered
abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they humbly bring pieces of
silver: and when he hath scattered the people that delight in war;
Then shall the princes come out of Eqypt: the Morians' land shall soon stretch
our her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord;
Who sitteth in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he doth send out his
voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.

SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.
I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is: I am come into deep waters, so
that the floods run over me.
I am weary of crying; my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for waiting so long
upon my God.
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that
are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.
I paid them the things that I never took: God, thou knowest my simpleness, and
my faults are not hid from thee.
Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my cause:
let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of
Israel.
And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof: shame hath covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an alien unto my mother's
children.
For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me: and the rebukes of them that
rebuked thee are fallen upon me.
I wept, and chastened myself with fasting: and that was turned to my reproof.
I put on sackcloth also: and they jested upon me.
They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs upon

But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.
Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the truth of thy salvation.

hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up: and let
not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable: turn thee unto me
according to the multitude of thy mercies.
And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: O haste thee, and
hear me.
Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: O deliver me, because of mine enemies.
Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are
all in thy sight.
Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to
have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.
They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and let the things that
should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.
Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not: and ever bow thou down their backs.
Pour out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold
of them.
Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they talk how they may vex
them whom thou hast wounded.
Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and not come into thy
righteousness.
Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be written among the
righteous.
As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God, shall lift me up.
I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with thanksgiving.
This also shall please the Lord: better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God, and your soul

For the Lord heareth the poor: and despiseth not his prisoners.
Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea, and all that moveth therein.

and have it in possession.

Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed: until I have

O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me, and yet didst thou
turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth
again.
Thou hast brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every side.
Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an
instrument of musick: unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Holy One

My lips will be fain when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul whom thou hast
delivered.

Saba shall bring gifts.
All kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do him service.
For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth: the needy also, and him that hath
no helper.
He shall be favourable to the simple and needy: and shall preserve the souls of

He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong: and dear shall their blood

He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia: prayer shall be
made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.
There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills: his fruit shall
shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city like grass upon the earth.
His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the
posterities: which shall be blessed through him; and all the heathen shall

Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone: my treadings had well-nigh slipt.
And why? I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such
prosperity.
For they are in no peril of death: but are lusty and strong.
They come in no misfortune like other folk: neither are they plagued like other
men.
And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride: and overwhelmed with
cruelty.
Their eyes swell with fatness: and they do even what they lust.
They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy: their talking is against the
most High.
For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their tongue goeth
through the world.
Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no small advantage.
Tush, say they, how should God perceive it: is there knowledge in the most High?
Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in
possession: and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed
mine hands in innocency.
All the day long have I been punished: and chastened every morning.
Yea, and I had almost said even as they: but lo, then I should have condemned
the generation of thy children.
Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me,
Until I went into the sanctuary of God: then understood I the end of these men;
Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places: and castest them down, and
destroyest them.
O how suddenly do they consume: perish, and come to a fearful end!
Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh: so shalt thou make their image to
vanish out of the city.
Thus my heart was grieved: and it went even through my reins.
So foolish was I, and ignorant: even as it were a beast before thee.
Nevertheless, I am alway by thee: for thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel: and after that receive me with glory.
Whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth that I desire in
comparison of thee.
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my
portion for ever.
For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that
commit fornication against thee.
But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord God: and
to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
<h3>Psalm 73</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot
against the sheep of thy pasture?
O think upon thy congregation: whom thou hast purchased and redeemed of old.
Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance: and mount Sion, wherein thou hast
dwelt.
Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy: which hath done
evil in thy sanctuary.
Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations: and set up their
banners for tokens.
He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees: was known to bring it to an
excellent work.
But now they break down all the carved work thereof: with axes and hammers.
They have set fire upon thy holy places: and have defiled the dwelling-place of
thy Name, even unto the ground.
Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether: thus have
they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.
We see not our tokens, there is not one prophet more: no, not one is there among
us, that understandeth any more.
O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour: how long shall the enemy
blaspheme thy Name, for ever?
Why withdrawest thou thy hand: why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy
bosom to consume the enemy?
For God is my King of old: the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself.
Thou didst divide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the
dragons in the waters.
Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces: and gavest him to be meat for the
people in the wilderness.
Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks: thou driedst up
mighty waters.
The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked: and how the foolish
people hath blasphemed thy Name.
O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the enemies: and
forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.
Look upon the covenant: for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel
habitations.
O let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the poor and needy give praise
unto thy Name.
Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
blasphemeth thee daily.
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the presumption of them that hate thee
increaseth ever more and more.

<h3>Psalm 74</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: A psalm of a song for Asaph
UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks: yea, unto thee do we give thanks.
Thy Name also is so nigh: and that do thy wondrous works declare.
When I receive the congregation: I shall judge according unto right.
The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the pillars of it.
I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly: and to the ungodly, Set not up your horn.
Set not up your horn on high: and speak not with a stiff neck.
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west: nor yet from the
south.
And why? God is the Judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixed,
and he poureth out of the same.
As for the dregs thereof: all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and suck
them out.
But I will talk of the God of Jacob: and praise him for ever.
All the horns of the ungodly also will I break: and the horns of the righteous shall
be exalted.
<h3>Psalm 75</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns, a psalm for Asaph: A song for the Assyrian
IN JEWRY is God known: his Name is great in Israel.
At Salem is his tabernacle: and his dwelling in Sion.
There brake he the arrows of the bow: the shield, the sword, and the battle.
Thou art of more honour and might: than the hills of the robbers.
The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep: and all the men whose hands
were mighty have found nothing.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob: both the chariot and horse are fallen.
Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when thou art
angry?
Thou didst cause thy judgement to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled,
and was still;
When God arose to judgement: and to help all the meek upon earth.
The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise: and the fierceness of them shalt
thou refrain.
Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that are round about him:
bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
He shall refrain the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among the kings of the
earth.
<h3>Psalm 76</h3>
For the end. For Idithun, a psalm of Asaph
I WILL cry unto God with my voice: even unto God will I cry with my voice, and
he shall hearken unto me.
In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran and ceased not in the
night-season ; my soul refused comfort.
When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God: when my heart is vexed, I will
complain.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble, that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old: and the years that are past.
I call to remembrance my song: and in the night I commune with mine own
heart, and search out my spirits.
Will the Lord absent himself for ever: and will he be no more intreated?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly to an end for
evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his loving-kindness in
displeasure?
And I said, It is mine own infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right
hand of the most Highest.
I will remember the works of the Lord: and call to mind thy wonders of old time.
I will think also of all thy works: and my talking shall be of thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is holy: who is so great a God as our God?
Thou art the God that doeth wonders: and hast declared thy power among the
people.
Thou hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid: the depths
also were troubled.
The clouds poured out water, the air thundered: and thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: the lightnings shone upon the
ground: the earth was moved, and shook withal.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and thy footsteps are
not known.
Thou leddest thy people like sheep: by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<h3>Psalm 77</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
HEAR my law, O my people: incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hard sentences of old;
Which we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told us;
That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to come: but
to shew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he
hath done.
He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law: which he commanded our
forefathers to teach their children;
That their posterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn;
To the intent that when they came up: they might shew their children the same;
That they might put their trust in God: and not to forget the works of God, but to
keep his commandments;
And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation: a
generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not
stedfastly unto God;
Like as the children of Ephraim: who being harnessed, and carrying bows,
turned themselves back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his law;
But forgat what he had done: and the wonderful works that he had shewed for
them.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt:
even in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea, and let them go through: he made the waters to stand on an
heap.
In the day-time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night through with a
light of fire.
He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness: and gave them drink thereof, as it had
been out of the great depth.
He brought waters out of the stony rock: so that it gushed out like the rivers.
Yet for all this they sinned more against him: and provoked the most Highest in
the wilderness.
They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their lust.
They spake against God also, saying: Shall God prepare a table in the
wilderness?
He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
flowed withal: but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?
When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and
there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;
Because they believed not in God: and put not their trust in his help.
So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.
He rained down manna also upon them for to eat: and gave them food from
heaven.
So man did eat angels' food: for he sent them meat enough.
He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven: and through his power he
brought in the south-west-wind.
He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand
of the sea.
He let it fall among their tents: even round about their habitation.
So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire: they were
not disappointed of their lust.
But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon
them, and slew the wealthiest of them: yea, and smote down the chosen
men that were in Israel.
But for all this they sinned yet more: and believed not his wondrous works.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years in trouble.
When he slew them, they sought him: and turned them early, and inquired after
God.
And they remembered that God was their strength: and that the high God was
their redeemer.
Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and dissembled with him
in their tongue.
For their heart was not whole with him: neither continued they stedfast in his
covenant.
But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds: and destroyed them not.
Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not suffer his whole
displeasure to arise.
For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were even a wind that
passeth away, and cometh not again.
Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness: and grieved him in the
desert.
They turned back, and tempted God: and moved the Holy One in Israel.
They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered them from the
hand of the enemy;
How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
He turned their waters into blood: so that they might not drink of the rivers.
He sent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to destroy them.
He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar: and their labour unto the grasshopper.
He destroyed their vines with hail-stones: and their mulberry-trees with the frost.
He smote their cattle also with hail-stones: and their flocks with hot
thunderbolts.
He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure and trouble:
and sent evil angels among them.
He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death: but gave
their life over to the pestilence;
And smote all the first-born in Egypt: the most principal and mightiest in the
dwellings of Ham.
But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep: and carried them in the
wilderness like a flock.
He brought them out safely, that they should not fear: and overwhelmed their
enemies with the sea.
And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary: even to his mountain
which he purchased with his right hand.
He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land to be divided among
them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not his testimonies;
But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers: starting aside like a
broken bow.
For they grieved him with their hill-altars: and provoked him to displeasure with
their images.
When God heard this, he was wroth: and took sore displeasure at Israel.
So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that he had pitched
among men.
He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with his inheritance.
The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not given to
marriage.
Their priests were slain with the sword: and there were no widows to make
lamentation.
So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep: and like a giant refreshed with wine.
He smote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a perpetual shame.
He refused the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
But chose the tribe of Judah: even the hill of Sion which he loved.
And there he built his temple on high: and laid the foundation of it like the
ground which he hath made continually.
He chose David also his servant: and took him away from the sheep-folds.
As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him: that he might
feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
So he fed them with a faithful and true heart: and ruled them prudently with all
his power.

A psalm for Asaph
O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they
defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the
air: and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.
Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem: and there was
no man to bury them.
We are become an open shame to our enemies: a very scorn and derision unto
them that are round about us.
Lord, how long wilt thou be angry: shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?
Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee: and upon
the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.
For they have devoured Jacob: and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon: for we are
come to great misery.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: O deliver us, and be
merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake.
Wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?
O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed: be openly shewed upon
the heathen in our sight.
O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to the
greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die.
And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee: reward
thou them , O Lord, seven-fold into their bosom.
So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for
ever: and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to
generation.

thyself also, thou that sittest upon the cherubims.
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses: stir up thy strength, and come, and
help us.
Turn us again, O God: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
O Lord God of hosts: how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears: and givest them plenteousness of
tears to drink.
Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh us
to scorn.
Turn us again, thou God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall
be whole.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and
planted it.
Thou madest room for it: and when it had taken root it filled the land.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it: and the boughs thereof were like
the goodly cedar-trees.
She stretched out her branches unto the sea: and her boughs unto the river.
Why hast thou then broken down her hedge: that all they that go by pluck off her
grapes?
The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up: and the wild beasts of the field
devour it.
Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven: behold, and visit this
vine;
And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted: and the branch
that thou madest so strong for thyself.
It is burnt with fire, and cut down: and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy
countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man, whom
thou madest so strong for thine own self.
And so will not we go back from thee: O let us live, and we shall call upon thy
Name.
Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.

Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret: the merry harp with the lute.
Blow up the trumpet in the new-moon: even in the time appointed, and upon our
solemn feast-day.
For this was made a statute for Israel: and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony: when he came out of the land of
Egypt, and had heard a strange language.
I eased his shoulder from the burden: and his hands were delivered from making
the pots.
Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee: and heard thee what
time as the storm fell upon thee.
I proved thee also: at the waters of strife.
Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel: if thou wilt hearken unto me,
There shall no strange god be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any other god.
I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy
mouth wide, and I shall fill it.
But my people would not hear my voice: and Israel would not obey me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts: and let them follow their own
imaginations.
O that my people would have hearkened unto me: for if Israel had walked in my
ways,
I should soon have put down their enemies: and turned my hand against their
adversaries.
The haters of the Lord should have been found liars: but their time should have
endured for ever.
He should have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour: and with honey out of
the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring: and they that hate thee have lift up

But do thou to them as unto the Madianites: unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the

Who perished at Endor: and became as the dung of the earth.
Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeb: yea, make all their princes like
as Zeba and Salmana;
Who say, Let us take to ourselves: the houses of God in possession.
O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and as the stubble before the wind;
Like as the fire that burneth up the wood: and as the flame that consumeth the
mountains.
Persecute them even so with thy tempest: and make them afraid with thy storm.
Make their faces ashamed, O Lord: that they may seek thy Name.
Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more: let them be put to
shame, and perish.
And they shall know that thou, whose Name is Jehovah: art only the most Highest

indignation.

Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever: and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from

Dost thou shew wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise up again, and

Shall thy loving-kindness be shewed in the grave: or thy faithfulness in
destruction?
Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy righteousness in the

Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come before thee.
Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face from me?
I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die: even from my youth
up thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me: and the fear of thee hath undone me.

My truth also and my mercy shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be
exalted.
I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand in the floods.
He shall call me, Thou art my Father: my God, and my strong salvation.
And I will make him my first-born: higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast with
him.
His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the days of
heaven.
But if his children forsake my law: and walk not in my judgements;
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I will visit their
offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.
Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my
truth to fail.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: I
have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David.
His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the sun before me.
He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the faithful witness in
heaven.
But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed: and art displeased at him.
Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his crown to the ground.
Thou hast overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong holds.
All they that go by spoil him: and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all his adversaries to
rejoice.
Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword: and givest him not victory in the
battle.
Thou hast put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: and covered him with dishonour.
Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever: and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
O remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men for
nought?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death: and shall he deliver his soul
from the hand of hell?
Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses: which thou swarest unto David in thy
truth?
Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I do bear in my
bosom the rebukes of many people.
Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of
thine Anointed: Praised be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

<h3>Psalm 89</h3>
A prayer of Moses the man of God
LORD, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of
men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a
watch in the night.
As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut down,
dried up and withered.
For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance.
For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our years to an end, as
it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong
that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but labour and
sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.
But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man feareth,
so is thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be glad all the
days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us: and for the years
wherein we have suffered adversity.
Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou the work
of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handywork.
<h3>Psalm 90</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the most High: shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty..
I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my strong hold: my God, in him
will I trust.
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome
pestilence.
He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers:
his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by
day;
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness that destroyeth
in the noon-day.
A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall
not come nigh thee.
Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold: and see the reward of the ungodly.
For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of defence very high.
There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou
tread under thy feet.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him
up, because he hath known my Name.
He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble; I will
deliver him, and bring him to honour.
With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation.

A psalm of a song for the Sabbath-day
IT IS a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy
Name, O most Highest.
To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning: and of thy truth in the nightseason.
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute: upon a loud instrument,
and upon the harp.
For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works: and I will rejoice in giving
praise for the operations of thy hands.
O Lord, how glorious are thy works: thy thoughts are very deep.
An unwise man doth not well consider this: and a fool doth not understand it.
When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish: then shall they be destroyed for ever; but thou,
Lord, art the most Highest for evermore.
For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, lo, thine enemies shall perish: and all the workers
of wickedness shall be destroyed.
But mine horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn: for I am anointed with
fresh oil.
Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies: and mine ear shall hear his
desire of the wicked that arise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar
in Libanus.
Such as are planted in the house of the Lord: shall flourish in the courts of the
house of our God.
They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age: and shall be fat and wellliking.
That they may shew how true the Lord my strength is: and that there is no
unrighteousness in him.
<h3>Psalm 92</h3>
For the day before the Sabbath. When the land was first inhabited, the praise of a song by David
THE Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his
apparel, and girded himself with strength.
He hath made the round world so sure: that it cannot be moved.
Ever since the world began hath thy seat been prepared: thou art from
everlasting.
The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lift up their voice: the floods lift up
their waves.
The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly: but yet the Lord, who
dwelleth on high, is mightier.
Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becometh thine house for ever.
<h3>Psalm 93</h3>
A psalm of David for the fourth day of the week
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth: thou God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself.
Arise, thou Judge of the world: and reward the proud after their deserving.
Lord, how long shall the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly triumph?
How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully: and make such proud
boasting?
They smite down thy people, O Lord: and trouble thine heritage.
They murder the widow and the stranger: and put the fatherless to death.
And yet they say, Tush, the Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob
regard it.
Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the eye, shall he not
see?
Or he that nurtureth the heathen: it is he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not
he punish?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man: that they are but vain.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him in thy law.
That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity: until the pit be digged
up for the ungodly.
For the Lord will not fail his people: neither will he forsake his inheritance;
Until righteousness turn again unto judgement: all such as are true in heart shall
follow it.
Who will rise up with me against the wicked: or who will take my part against
the evil-doers?
If the Lord had not helped me: it had not failed but my soul had been put to
silence.
But when I said, My foot hath slipt: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.
In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart: thy comforts have
refreshed my soul.
Wilt thou have any thing to do with the stool of wickedness: which imagineth
mischief as a law?
They gather them together against the soul of the righteous: and condemn the
innocent blood.
But the Lord is my refuge: and my God is the strength of my confidence.
He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own
malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

For the Lord is a great God: and a great King above all gods.

The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep

To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the provocation,
and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: It is a people that

Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.

Glory and worship are before him: power and honour are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people: ascribe unto the Lord

Ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his Name: bring presents, and come

O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let the whole earth stand in awe of
him.
Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King: and that it is he who hath
made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; and how that he
shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea make a noise, and
all that therein is.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood
rejoice before the Lord.
For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: and with righteousness to judge
the world, and the people with his truth.

THE Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles

Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgement are the

There shall go a fire before him: and burn up his enemies on every side.
His lightnings gave shine unto the world: the earth saw it, and was afraid.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord
of the whole earth.
The heavens have declared his righteousness: and all the people have seen his
glory.
Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in vain
gods: worship him, all ye gods.
Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad, because of
thy judgements, O Lord.
For thou, Lord, art higher than all that are in the earth: thou art exalted far
above all gods.
O ye that love the Lord, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: the Lord
preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of
the ungodly.
There is sprung up a light for the righteous: and the joyful gladness for such as
are true-hearted.
Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous: and give thanks for a remembrance of his

HEAR my prayer, O Lord: and let my crying come unto thee.
Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine ear unto me
when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.
For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt up as it

My heart is smitten down, and withered liked grass: so that I forget to eat my

For the voice of my groaning: my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.
I am become like a pelican in the wilderness: and like an owl that is in the desert.
I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that sitteth alone upon the
house-top.
Mine enemies revile me all the day long: and they that are mad upon me are
sworn together against me.
For I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping.
And that because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and
cast me down.
My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.
But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever: and thy remembrance throughout all
generations.
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that thou have mercy
upon her, yea, the time is come.
And why? thy servants think upon her stones: and it pitieth them to see her in
the dust.
The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy

When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall appear;
When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute: and despiseth not

This shall be written for those that come after: and the people which shall be

For he hath looked down from his sanctuary: out of the heaven did the Lord
behold the earth;
That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity: and deliver the
children appointed unto death;
That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion: and his worship at
Jerusalem;
When the people are gathered together: and the kingdoms also, to serve the
Lord.
He brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.
But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age: as for thy
years, they endure throughout all generations.
Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax old as doth a

And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art

Who saveth thy life from destruction: and crowneth thee with mercy and lovingkindness;
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: making thee young and lusty as an

The Lord executeth righteousness and judgement: for all them that are
oppressed with wrong.
He shewed his ways unto Moses: his works unto the children of Israel.
The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and of great goodness.
He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth he his anger for ever.
He hath not dealt with us after our sins: nor rewarded us according to our

For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth: so great is his mercy
also toward them that fear him.
Look how wide also the east is from the west: so far hath he set our sins from us.
Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children: even so is the Lord merciful unto
them that fear him.
For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that we are but dust.
The days of man are but as grass: for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.
For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone: and the place thereof shall know
it no more.
But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon them that
fear him: and his righteousness upon children's children;
Even upon such as keep his covenant: and think upon his commandments to do
them.
The Lord hath prepared his seat in heaven: and his kingdom ruleth over all.
O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength: ye that fulfil his
commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words.

Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: and maketh the clouds his

He maketh his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire.
He laid the foundations of the earth: that it never should move at any time.

At thy rebuke they flee: at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.
They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath: even unto the

Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass: neither turn again to

He sendeth the springs into the rivers: which run among the hills.
All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild asses quench their thirst.
Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation: and sing among the

He bringeth forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the service of men;

He appointed the moon for certain seasons: and the sun knoweth his going down.
Thou makest darkness that it may be night: wherein all the beasts of the forest
do move.
The lions roaring after their prey: do seek their meat from God.
The sun ariseth, and they get them away together: and lay them down in their
dens.
Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour: until the evening.
O Lord, how manifold are thy works: in wisdom hast thou made them all; the
earth is full of thy riches.
So is the great and wide sea also: wherein are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great beasts.
There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan: whom thou hast made to take his
pastime therein.
These wait all upon thee: that thou mayest give them meat in due season.
When thou givest it them they gather it: and when thou openest thy hand they
are filled with good.
When thou hidest thy face they are troubled: when thou takest away their breath
they die, and are turned again to their dust.
When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made: and thou shalt renew
the face of the earth.
The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in
his works.
The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch the hills, they shall
smoke.
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will praise my God while I have my
being.
And so shall my words please him: my joy shall be in the Lord.
As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall

When there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in the land;
What time as they went from one nation to another: from one kingdom to another

He suffered no man to do them wrong: but reproved even kings for their sakes;
Touch not mine Anointed: and do my prophets no harm.

Israel also came into Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people exceedingly: and made them stronger than their

Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people: and dealt untruly with his
servants.
Then sent he Moses his servant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.
And these shewed his tokens among them: and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and it was dark: and they were not obedient unto his word.
He turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs: yea, even in their kings' chambers.
He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies: and lice in all their
quarters.
He gave them hail-stones for rain: and flames of fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and fig-trees: and destroyed the trees that were in

He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable:
and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their
ground.
He smote all the first-born in their land: even the chief of all their strength.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person
among their tribes.
Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were afraid of them.
He spread out a cloud to be a covering: and fire to give light in the night-season.
At their desire he brought quails: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in the
dry places.
For why? he remembered his holy promise: and Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy: and his chosen with gladness.
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people
in possession;
That they might keep his statutes: and observe his laws.

And he saved them from the adversaries' hand: and delivered them from the

As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them: there was not

Then believed they his words: and sang praise unto him.
But within a while they forgat his works: and would not abide his counsel.

Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.
And they forgat God their Saviour: who had done so great things in Egypt;
Wondrous works in the land of Ham: and fearful things by the Red sea.
So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood
before him in the gap: to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should
destroy them.
Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no credence unto his
word;
But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord.
Then lift he up his hand against them: to overthrow them in the wilderness;
To cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves unto Baal-peor: and ate the offerings of the dead.
Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions: and the plague was
great among them.
Then stood up Phinees and prayed: and so the plague ceased.
And that was counted unto him for righteousness: among all posterities for
evermore.
They angered him also at the waters of strife: so that he punished Moses for
their sakes;
Because they provoked his spirit: so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Neither destroyed they the heathen: as the Lord commanded them;
But were mingled among the heathen: and learned their works.
Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay: yea,
they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters:
whom they had offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled
with blood.
Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring with their own
inventions.
Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people: insomuch that
he abhorred his own inheritance.
And he gave them over into the hands of the heathen: and they that hated them
were lords over them.
Their enemies oppressed them: and had them in subjection.
Many a time did he deliver them: but they rebelled against him with their own
inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.
Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity: he heard their complaint.
He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude of
his mercies: yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity
them.
Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen: that we may
give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world without end: and
let all the people say, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 106</h3>
Alleluia
Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed: and delivered from the
hand of the enemy;
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west: from the
north and from the south.
They went astray in the wilderness out of the way: and found no city to dwell in;
Hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.
So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: and he delivered them from their
distress.
He led them forth by the right way: that they might go to the city where they
dwelt.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he satisfieth the empty soul: and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: being fast bound in misery
and iron ;
Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly regarded the
counsel of the most Highest;
He also brought down their heart through heaviness: they fell down, and there
was none to help them.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death: and brake
their bonds in sunder.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he hath broken the gates of brass: and smitten the bars of iron in sunder.
Foolish men are plagued for their offence: and because of their wickedness.
Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they were even hard at death's door.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
He sent his word, and healed them: and they were saved from their destruction.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving: and tell out his
works with gladness!
They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their business in great waters;
These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.
For at his word the stormy wind ariseth: which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep: their soul
melteth away because of the trouble.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are at their wits' end.
So when thy cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivereth them out of their
distress.
For he maketh the storm to cease: so that the waves thereof are still.
Then are they glad, because they are at rest: and so he bringeth them unto the
haven where they would be.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people: and praise him
in the seat of the elders!
Who turneth the floods into a wilderness: and drieth up the water-springs.
A fruitful land maketh he barren: for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water: and water-springs of a dry
ground.
And there he setteth the hungry: that they may build them a city to dwell in.
That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards: to yield them fruits of
increase.
He blesseth them so that they multiply exceedingly: and suffereth not their cattle
to decrease.
And again, when they are minished and brought low: through oppression,
through any plague or trouble;
Though he suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants: and let them wander
out of the way in the wilderness.
Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery: and maketh him households like a flock of
sheep.
The righteous will consider this, and rejoice: and the mouth of all wickedness
shall be stopped.
Whoso is wise will ponder these things: and they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 107</h3>
Song of a psalm by David
O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing and give praise with the
best member that I have.
Awake, thou lute, and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing praises unto
thee among the nations.
For thy mercy is greater than the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
That thy beloved may be delivered: let thy right hand save them, and hear thou
me.
God hath spoken in his holiness: I will rejoice therefore, and divide Sichem, and
mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head.
Judah is my law-giver, Moab is my wash-pot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe,
upon Philistia will I triumph.
Who will lead me into the strong city: and who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou forsaken us, O God: and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our
hosts?
O help us against the enemy: for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do great acts: and it is he that shall tread down our
enemies.
<h3>Psalm 108</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise: for the mouth of the ungodly, yea, the
mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.
And they have spoken against me with false tongues: they compassed me about
also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part: but I give
myself unto prayer.
Thus have they rewarded me evil for good: and hatred for my good will.
Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand.
When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned: and let his prayer be
turned into sin.
Let his days be few: and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless: and his wife a widow.
Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread: let them seek it also out of
desolate places.
Let the extortioner consume all that he hath: and let the stranger spoil his
labour.
Let there be no man to pity him: nor to have compassion upon his fatherless
children.
Let his posterity be destroyed: and in the next generation let his name be clean
put out.
Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight of the Lord:
and let not the sin of his mother be done away.
Let them alway be before the Lord: that he may root out the memorial of them
from off the earth.
And that, because his mind was not to do good: but persecuted the poor helpless
man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.
His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him: he loved not blessing,
therefore shall it be far from him.
He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a raiment: and it shall come into his
bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be unto him as the cloke that he hath upon him: and as the girdle that he is
alway girded withal.
Let it thus happen from the Lord unto mine enemies: and to those that speak evil
against my soul.
But deal thou with me, O Lord God, according unto thy Name: for sweet is thy
mercy.
O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor: and my heart is wounded within me.
I go hence like the shadow that departeth: and am driven away as the
grasshopper.
My knees are weak through fasting: my flesh is dried up for want of fatness.
I became also a reproach unto them: they that looked upon me shaked their
heads.
Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy.
And they shall know, how that this is thy hand: and that thou, Lord, hast done it.
Though they curse, yet bless thou: and let them be confounded that rise up
against me; but let thy servant rejoice.
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame: and let them cover themselves with
their own confusion, as with a cloke.
As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth: and praise him
among the multitude.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor: to save his soul from the
unrighteous judges.

Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitful tongue.
What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue: even mighty
and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.
Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech: and to have my

O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.

He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world: and sendeth forth
lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his treasures.
He smote the first-born of Egypt: both of man and beast.
He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of Egypt:
upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.
He smote divers nations: and slew mighty kings;
Sehon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Basan: and all the kingdoms of
Canaan;
And gave their land to be an heritage: even an heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever: so doth thy memorial, O Lord, from one

With a mighty hand, and stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who divided the Red sea in two parts: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And made Israel to go through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever.
But as for Pharaoh and his host, he overthrew them in the Red sea: for his mercy

For lo, there is not a word in my tongue: but thou, O Lord, knowest it altogether.

Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me.
If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall my night be turned

Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day:
the darkness and light to thee are both alike.
For my reins are thine: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous
are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.
My bones are not hid from thee: though I be made secretly, and fashioned
beneath in the earth.
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect: and in thy book were all
my members written;
Which day by day were fashioned: when as yet there was none of them.
How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God: O how great is the sum of them!
If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: when I wake up I am
present with thee.
Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God: depart from me, ye blood-thirsty men.
For they speak unrighteously against thee: and thine enemies take thy Name in
vain.
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee: and am not I grieved with those that
rise up against thee?
Yea, I hate them right sore: even as though they were mine enemies.
Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart: prove me, and examine my
thoughts.
Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me: and lead me in the way
everlasting.

lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly: preserve me from the wicked
men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.
The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with cords: yea, and
set traps in my way.
I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my prayers, O Lord.
O Lord God, thou strength of my health: thou hast covered my head in the day of

Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord: let not his mischievous imagination
prosper, lest they be too proud.
Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them: that compass me
about.
Let hot burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire and into the
pit, that they never rise up again.
A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: evil shall hunt the wicked
person to overthrow him.

Consider my complaint: for I am brought very low.

Therefore is my spirit vexed within me: and my heart within me is desolate.
Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works: yea, I exercise

I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.
Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint: hide not thy face from

O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for in thee is my trust:
shew thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I flee unto thee to hide me.
Teach me to do a thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God: let thy loving
Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.
Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name's sake: and for thy righteousness' sake bring

<h3>Psalm 145</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul; while I live will I praise the Lord: yea, as long as I
have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.
O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man: for there is no help in
them.
For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn again to his earth: and then
all his thoughts perish.
Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help: and whose hope is in the
Lord his God;
Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: who keepeth his
promise for ever;
Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong: who feedeth the hungry.
The Lord looseth men out of prison: the Lord giveth sight to the blind.
The Lord helpeth them that are fallen: the Lord careth for the righteous.
The Lord careth for the strangers, he defendeth the fatherless and widow :as for
the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.
The Lord thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore: and throughout all
generations.
<h3>Psalm 146</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God: yea, a
joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: and gather together the out-casts of Israel.
He healeth those that are broken in heart: and giveth medicine to heal their
sickness.
He telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and great is his power: yea, and his wisdom is infinite.
The Lord setteth up the meek: and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground.
O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving: sing praises upon the harp unto our God;
Who covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth: and
maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men;
Who giveth fodder unto the cattle: and feedeth the young ravens that call upon
him.
He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse: neither delighteth he in any
man's legs.
But the Lord's delight is in them that fear him: and put their trust in his mercy.
<h3>Psalm 147</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.
For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates: and hath blessed thy children within
thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: and his word runneth very
swiftly.
He giveth snow like wool: and scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who is able to abide his frost?
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he bloweth with his wind, and the
waters flow.
He sheweth his word unto Jacob: his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with any nation: neither have the heathen knowledge of his
laws.

<h3>Psalm 148</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord of heaven: praise him in the height.
Praise him, all ye angels of his: praise him, all his host.
Praise him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars and light.
Praise him, all ye heavens: and ye waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the Name of the Lord: for he spake the word, and they were
made; he commanded, and they were created.
He hath made them fast for ever and ever: he hath given them a law which shall
not be broken.
Praise the Lord upon earth: ye dragons, and all deeps;
Fire and hail, snow and vapours: wind and storm, fulfilling his word;
Mountains and all hills: fruitful trees and all cedars;
Beasts and all cattle: worms and feathered fowls;
Kings of the earth and all people: princes and all judges of the world;
Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of the Lord: for
his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven and earth.
He shalt exalt the horn of his people; all his saints shall praise him: even the
children of Israel, even the people the serveth him.
<h3>Psalm 149</h3>
Alleluia
O SING unto the Lord a new song: let the congregation of saints praise him.
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: and let the children of Sion be joyful in
their King.
Let them praise his Name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with
tabret and harp.
For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: and helpeth the meek-hearted.
Let the saints be joyful with glory: let them rejoice in their beds.
Let the praises of God be in their mouth: and a two-edged sword in their hands;
To be avenged of the heathen: and to rebuke the people;
To bind their kings in chains: and their nobles with links of iron.
That they may be avenged of them, as it is written: Such honour have all his
saints.
<h3>Psalm 150</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE God in his holiness: praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him in his noble acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.
Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: praise him upon the lute and harp.
Praise him in the cymbals and dances: praise him upon the strings and pipe.
Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: praise him upon the loud cymbals.
Let every thing that hath breath: praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 151</h3>
This psalm is ascribed to David and is outside the number. When he slew Goliath in single
combat.
LITTLE was I among my brethren: a younger brother in my father’s house.
My hands, they made an instrument of music: my fingers, they prepared a
psaltery.
And who shall bring back tidings to my master? The Lord himself, himself gives
ear.
Himself sent forth his messenger: and took me from among my father’s sheep;
and with the oil of his anointing He anointed me.
Comely my brethren were and tall: and yet they found not favor with the Lord.
But I, I sallied forth to meet the alien: and he reviled me by all his idols.
But I drew forth the sword that was beside him: I cut his head off with it, and
from the sons of Israel removed reproach."""
