<h3>Psalm 37</h3>
A psalm of David . For remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day
PUT me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy heavy
displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me: and thy hand presseth me sore.
There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure: neither is there any
rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.
For my wickednesses are gone over my head: and are like a sore burden, too
heavy for me to bear.
My wounds stink, and are corrupt: through my foolishness.
I am brought into so great trouble and misery: that I go mourning all the day
long.
For my loins are filled with a sore disease: and there is no whole part in my body.
I am feeble, and sore smitten: I have roared for the very disquietness of my
heart.
Lord, thou knowest all my desire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me: and the sight of mine eyes is gone
from me.
My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble: and my
kinsmen stood afar off.
They also that sought after my life laid snares for me: and they that went about
to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit all the day long.
As for me I was like a deaf men, and heard not: and as one that is dumb, who
doth not open his mouth.
I became even as a man that heareth not: and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my
God.
I have required that they, even mine enemies should not triumph over me: for
when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me.
And I, truly, am set in the plague: and my heaviness is ever in my sight.
For I will confess my wickedness: and be sorry for my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are mighty: and they that hate me wrongfully are
many in number.
They also that reward evil for good are against me: because I follow the thing
that good is.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me.
Haste thee to help me: O Lord God of my salvation.
<h3>Psalm 38</h3>
For the end. A song of David, for Idithun
I SAID, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not in my tongue.
I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle: while the ungodly is in my sight.
I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even from good words;
but it was pain and grief to me.
My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire kindled: and at
the last I spake with my tongue;
Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may be certified
how long I have to live.
Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long: and mine age is even as
nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is altogether vanity.
For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth
up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.
And now, Lord, what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.
Deliver me from all mine offences: and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.
I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.
Take thy plague away from me: I am even consumed by the means of thy heavy
hand.
When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to
consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man
therefore is but vanity.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling: hold not thy
peace at my tears.
For I am a stranger with thee: and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence, and be no
more seen
<h3>Psalm 39</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
I WAITED patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and heard my calling.
He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay: and set my
feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth: even a thanksgiving unto our God.
Many shall see it, and fear: and shall put their trust in the Lord.
Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the Lord: and turned not unto the
proud, and to such as go about with lies.
O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like as be
also thy thoughts which are to us-ward: and yet there is no man that
ordereth them unto thee:
If I should declare them, and speak of them: they should be more than I am able
to express.
Sacrifice and meat-offering thou wouldest not: but mine ears hast thou opened.
Burnt-offerings, and sacrifice for sin, hast thou not required: then said I, Lo, I
come,
In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil thy will, O my
God: I am content to do it; yea, thy law is within my heart.
I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I will not refrain
my lips, O Lord, and that thou knowest.
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart: my talk hath been of thy truth
and of thy salvation.
I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth: from the great congregation.
Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord: let thy loving-kindness and thy
truth alway preserve me.
For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such hold upon
me that I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the
hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.
O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me: make haste, O Lord, to help me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after my soul to
destroy it: let them be driven backward and put to rebuke, that wish me
evil.
Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame: that say unto me, Fie upon
thee, fie upon thee.
Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let such as love thy
salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and needy: but the Lord careth for me.
Thou art my helper and redeemer: make no long tarrying, O my God.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 40</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him
in the time of trouble.
The Lord preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth:
and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.
The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick upon his bed: make thou all his bed in
his sickness.
I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies speak evil of me: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: and his heart conceiveth falsehood
within himself, and when he cometh forth he telleth it.
All mine enemies whisper together against me: even against me do they imagine
this evil.
Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him: and now that he lieth, let him
rise up no more.
Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted: who did also eat of my
bread, hath laid great wait for me.
But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord: raise thou me up again, and I shall reward
them.
By this I know thou favourest me: that mine enemy doth not triumph against me.
And when I am in my health, thou upholdest me: and shalt set me before thy face
for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: world without end. Amen.
<h3>Psalm 41</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: when shall I come to
appear before the presence of God?
My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where
is now thy God?
Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the
multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;
In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day.
Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted
within me?
Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his
countenance.
My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore will I remember thee concerning
the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermon.
One deep calleth another, because of the noise of the water-pipes: all thy waves
and storms are gone over me.
The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time: and in the nightseason did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me: why go I
thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword: while mine enemies that trouble
me cast me in the teeth;
Namely, while they say daily unto me: Where is now thy God?
Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.
<h3>Psalm 42</h3>
A psalm of David
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people:
O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.
For thou art the God of my strength, why hast thou put me from thee: and why
go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me: and bring me unto thy
holy hill, and to thy dwelling.
And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and
gladness: and upon the harp I will give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.

<h3>Psalm 43</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
WE HAVE heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us: what thou hast
done in their time of old;
How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted them in: how
thou hast destroyed the nations and cast them out.
For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword: neither was it
their own arm that helped them;
But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance: because
thou hadst a favour unto them.
Thou art my King, O God: send help unto Jacob.
Through thee will we overthrow our enemies: and in thy Name will we tread
them under, that rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow: it is not my sword that shall help me;
But it is thou that savest us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion that
hate us.
We make our boast of God all day long: and will praise thy Name for ever.
But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion: and goest not forth with our
armies.
Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies: so that they which hate us
spoil our goods.
Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep: and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Thou sellest thy people for nought: and takest no money for them.
Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours: to be laughed to scorn, and had
in derision of them that are round about us.
Thou makest us to be a by-word among the heathen: and that the people shake
their heads at us.
My confusion is daily before me: and the shame of my face hath covered me;
For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer: for the enemy and avenger.
And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee: nor behave
ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.
Our heart is not turned back: neither our steps gone out of thy way;
No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons: and covered us with
the shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to any
strange God: shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very secrets of
the heart.
For thy sake also are we killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep
appointed to be slain.
Up, Lord, why sleepest thou: awake, and be not absent from us for ever.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face: and forgettest our misery and trouble?
For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
ground.
Arise, and help us: and deliver us for thy mercy's sake.
<h3>Psalm 44</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses by the sons of Core, for instruction. A Song concerning the
beloved
MY HEART is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the thing which I have made
unto the King.
My tongue is the pen: of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, because God
hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most Mighty: according to thy
worship and renown.
Good luck have thou with thine honour: ride on, because of the word of truth , of
meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible
things.
Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be subdued unto thee: even in
the midst among the King's enemies.
Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, even thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia: out of the ivory palaces,
whereby they have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did
stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, incline thine ear ; forget also thine own
people, and thy father's house.
So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty: for his is thy Lord God, and
worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: like as the rich also among
the people shall make their supplication before thee.
The King's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work: the virgins that be
her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee.
With joy and gladness shall they be brought: and shall enter into the King's
palace.
Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children: whom thou mayest make princes
in all lands.
I will remember thy Name from one generation to another: therefore shall the
people give thanks unto thee, world without end.
<h3>Psalm 45</h3>
For the end. For the sons of Core; a psalm concerning secret things
GOD is our hope and strength: a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved: and though the hills be
carried into the midst of the sea;
Though the waters thereof rage and swell: and though the mountains shake at
the tempest of the same.
The rivers of the flood thereof shall make glad the city of God: the holy place of
the tabernacle of the most Highest.
God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed: God shall help
her, and that right early.
The heathen make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved: but God hath shewed
his voice, and the earth shall melt away.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.
O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord: what destruction he hath
brought upon the earth.
He maketh wars to cease in all the world: he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the
spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.
Be still then, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I
will be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

<h3>Psalm 46</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O CLAP your hand together, all ye people: O sing unto God with the voice of
melody.
For the Lord is high, and to be feared: he is the great King upon all the earth.
He shall subdue the people under us: and the nations under our feet.
He shall choose out an heritage for us: even the worship of Jacob, whom he
loved.
God is gone up with a merry noise: and the Lord with the sound of the trump.
O sing praises, sing praises unto our God: O sing praises, sing praises unto our
King.
For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon his holy seat.
The princes of the people are joined unto the people of the God of Abraham: for
God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the earth, as it were with a
shield.
<h3>Psalm 47</h3>
A psalm of praise for the sons of Core on the second day of the week
GREAT is the Lord, and highly to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his
holy hill.
The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth: upon the north-side
lieth the city of the great King; God is well known in her palaces as a sure
refuge.
For lo, the kings of the earth: are gathered, and gone by together.
They marvelled to see such things: they were astonished, and suddenly cast
down.
Fear came there upon them, and sorrow: as upon a woman in her travail.
Thou shalt break the ships of the sea: through the east wind.
Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the
city of our God: God upholdeth the same for ever.
We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God: in the midst of thy temple.
O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's end: thy right
hand is full of righteousness.
Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad: because of thy
judgements.
Walk about Sion, and go round about her: and tell the towers thereof.
Mark well her bulwarks, set up her houses: that ye may tell them that come
after.
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he shall be our guide unto death.
<h3>Psalm 48</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O HEAR ye this, all ye people: ponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the
world;
High and low, rich and poor: one with another.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom: and my heart shall muse of understanding.
I will incline mine ear to the parable: and shew my dark speech upon the harp.
Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness: and when the wickedness of
my heels compasseth me round about?
There be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches.
But no man may deliver his brother: nor make agreement unto God for him;
For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that alone for ever;
Yea, though he live long: and see not the grave.
For he seeth that wise men also die, and perish together: as well as the ignorant
and foolish, and leave their riches for other.
And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever: and that their
dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the
lands after their own names.
Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour: seeing that he may be compared
unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them.
This is their foolishness: and their posterity praise their saying.
They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and the righteous shall
have domination over them in the morning: their beauty shall consume in
the sepulchre out of their dwelling.
But God hath delivered my soul from the place of hell: for he shall receive me.
Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich: or if the glory of his house be
increased.
For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth: neither shall his pomp
follow him.
For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man: and so long as thou doest
well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.
He shall follow the generation of his fathers: and shall never see light.
Man being in honour hath no understanding: but is compared unto the beasts
that perish.

<h3>Psalm 49</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
THE Lord, even the most mighty God, hath spoken: and called the world, from
the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Out of Sion hath God appeared: in perfect beauty.
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: there shall go before him a
consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up round about him.
He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth, that he may judge his people.
Gather my saints together unto me: those that have made a covenant with me
with sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is Judge himself.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak: I myself will testify against thee, O Israel;
for I am God, even thy God.
I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt-offerings:
because they were not alway before me.
I will take no bullock out of thine house: nor he-goat out of thy folds.
For all the beasts of the forest are mine: and so are the cattle upon a thousand
hills.
I know all the fowls upon the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are in
my sight.
If I be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the whole world is mine, and all that is
therein.
Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh: and drink the blood of goats?
Offer unto God thanksgiving: and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.
And call upon me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise
me.
But unto the ungodly said God: Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my
covenant in thy mouth;
Whereas thou hatest to be reformed: and has cast my words behind thee?
When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him: and hast been partaker
with the adulterers.
Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness: and with thy tongue thou hast set
forth deceit.
Thou satest, and spakest against thy brother: yea, and hast slandered thine own
mother's son.
These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest
wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and
set before thee the things that thou hast done.
O consider this, ye that forget God: lest I pluck you away, and there be none to
deliver you.
Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation right will I shew the salvation of God.
<h3>Psalm 50</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to
Bathsheba
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according to the
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.
Wash me throughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.
Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin hath my mother conceived me.
But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand
wisdom secretly.
Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice.
Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.
Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health: and
my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.
Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy praise.
For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou delightest not in
burnt-offerings.
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt
thou not despise.
O be favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burntofferings and oblations: then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine
altar.

<h3>Psalm 51</h3>
For the end. A psalm of instruction by David, when Doeg the Idumean came and told Saul that
David had gone to the house of Abimelech
WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant: that thou canst do mischief;
Whereas the goodness of God: endureth yet daily?
Thy tongue imagineth wickedness: and with lies thou cuttest like a sharp rasor.
Thou hast loved unrighteousness more then goodness: and to talk of lies more
than righteousness.
Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt: O thou false tongue.
Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever: he shall take thee, and pluck thee out
of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of the living.
The righteous also shall see this, and fear: and shall laugh him to scorn;
Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength: but trusted unto the
multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: my trust is in the
tender mercy of God for ever and ever.
I will always give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done: and I will hope in thy
Name, for thy saints like it well.
<h3>Psalm 52</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David upon Maeleth, of instruction
THE foolish body hath said in his heart: There is no God.
Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness: there is none that
doeth good.
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there were any
that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is also none that doeth good, no not one.
Are not they without understanding, that work wickedness: eating up my people
as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.
They were afraid where no fear was: for God hath broken the bones of him that
besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because God hath despised
them.
O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion: O that the Lord would
deliver his people out of captivity!
Then should Jacob rejoice: and Israel should be right glad.
<h3>Psalm 53</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of instruction by David. When the Ziphites came and said to Saul,
Lo, is not David hid with us?
SAVE me, O God, for thy Name's sake: and avenge me in thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God: and hearken unto the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me: and tyrants, which have not God before
their eyes, seek after my soul.
Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy truth.
An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O Lord: because
it is so comfortable.
For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire
upon mine enemies.
<h3>Psalm 54</h3>
For the end. Among hymns of instruction by David
HEAR my prayer, O God: and hide not thyself from my petition.
Take heed unto me, and hear me: how I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed.
The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast: for they are minded to
do me some mischief; so maliciously are they set against me.
My heart is disquieted within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me: and an horrible dread hath
overwhelmed me.
And I said, O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I flee away, and be at
rest.
Lo, then would I get me away far off: and remain in the wilderness.
I would make haste to escape: because of the stormy wind and tempest.
Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them: for I have spied unrighteousness
and strife in the city.
Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow
are in the midst of it.
Wickedness is therein: deceit and guile go not out of their streets.
For it is not an open enemy, that hath done me this dishonour: for then I could
have borne it.
Neither was it mine adversary, that did magnify himself against me: for then
peradventure I would have hid myself from him.
But it was even thou, my companion: my guide, and mine own familiar friend.
We took sweet counsel together: and walked in the house of God as friends.
Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for
wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord shall save me.
In the evening, and morning, and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly: and
he shall hear my voice.
It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
for there were many with me.
Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them down: for
they will not turn, nor fear God.
He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him: and he brake his covenant.
The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart: his
words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very swords.
O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: and shall not suffer
the righteous to fall for ever.
And as for them: thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction.
The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days:
nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.

<h3>Psalm 55</h3>
For the end. Concerning the people that were removed from the sanctuary. By David for a
memorial, when the Philistines caught him in Gath
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me: he is daily
fighting, and troubling me.
Mine enemies are daily in hand to swallow me up: for they be many that fight
against me, O thou most Highest.
Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid: yet put I my trust in thee.
I will praise God, because of his word: I have put my trust in God, and will not
fear what flesh can do unto me.
They daily mistake my words: all that they imagine is to do me evil.
They hold all together, and keep themselves close: and mark my steps, when
they lay wait for my soul.
Shall they escape for their wickedness: thou, O God, in thy displeasure shalt cast
them down.
Thou tellest my flittings; put my tears into thy bottle: are not these things noted
in thy book?
Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight: this I
know; for God is on my side.
In God's word I will rejoice: in the Lord's word will I comfort me.
Yea, in God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows: unto thee will I give thanks.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling: that I may
walk before God in the light of the living.
<h3>Psalm 56</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David, for a memorial. When he fled from the presence of Saul to
the cave
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, be merciful unto me, for my soul trusteth in
thee: and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until this
tyranny be over-past.
I will call unto the most high God: even unto the God that shall perform the
cause which I have in hand.
He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him that would eat
me up.
God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among lions.
And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are
spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they have digged a
pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, and give praise.
Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee
among the nations.
For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens: and thy truth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 57</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation: and do ye judge the
thing that is right, O ye sons of men?
Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth: and your hands deal with
wickedness.
The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb: as soon as they are
born, they go astray, and speak lies.
They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent: even like the deaf adder that
stoppeth her ears.
Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer: charm he never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; smite the jaw-bones of the lions, O
Lord: let them fall away like water that runneth apace; and when they
shoot their arrows let them be rooted out.
Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of a woman:
and let them not see the sun.
Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns: so let indignation vex him, even as a
thing that is raw.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his
footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: doubtless
there is a God that judgeth the earth.

<h3>Psalm 58</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David for a memorial, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill
him
DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God: defend me from them that rise up
against me.
O deliver me from the wicked doers: and save me from the blood-thirsty men.
For lo, they lie waiting for my soul: the mighty men are gathered against me,
without any offence or fault of me, O Lord.
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: arise thou therefore to help
me, and behold.
Stand up, O Lord God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the heathen: and be
not merciful unto them that offend of malicious wickedness.
They go to and fro in the evening: they grin like a dog, and run about through the
city.
Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips: for who doth
hear?
But thou. O Lord, shalt have them in derision: and thou shalt laugh all the
heathen to scorn.
My strength will I ascribe unto thee: for thou art the God of my refuge.
God sheweth me his goodness plenteously: and God shall let me see my desire
upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget it: but scatter them abroad among the
people, and put them down, O Lord, our defence.
For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be taken in
their pride: and why? their preaching is of cursing and lies.
Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish: and know that
it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.
And in the evening they will return: grin like a dog, and will go about the city.
They will run here and there for meat: and grudge if they be not satisfied.
As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betimes in the
morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
trouble.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my
merciful God.
<h3>Psalm 59</h3>
For the end. For them that shall yet be changed. For an inscription by David for instruction.
When he had burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syrian Sobal, and Joab had returned and smitten
twelve thousand in the Valley of Salt
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad: thou hast also been
displeased; O turn thee unto us again.
Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: heal the sores thereof, for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewed thy people heavy things: thou hast given us a drink of deadly
wine.
Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee: that they may triumph because of
the truth.
Therefore were thy beloved delivered: help me with thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Sichem: and mete out
the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head;
Judah is my law-giver.
Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, be thou glad
of me.
Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou cast us out, O God: wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
O be thou our help in trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Through God will we do great acts: for it is he that shall tread down our enemies.
<h3>Psalm 60</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of David
HEAR my crying, O God: give ear unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth will I call unto thee: when my heart is in heaviness.
O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I: for thou hast been my hope, and
a strong tower for me against the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: and my trust shall be under the covering of
thy wings.
For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires: and hast given an heritage unto those
that fear thy Name.
Thou shalt grant the King a long life: that his years may endure throughout all
generations.
He shall dwell before God for ever: O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness,
that they may preserve him.
So will I always sing praise unto thy Name: that I may daily perform my vows.

<h3>Psalm 61</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David for Idithun
MY SOUL truly waiteth still upon God: for of him cometh my salvation.
He verily is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
greatly fall.
How long will ye imagine mischief against every man: ye shall be slain all the
sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and like a broken hedge.
Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt: their delight is in
lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse with their heart.
Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God: for my hope is in him.
He truly is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
fall.
In God is my health, and my glory: the rock of my might, and in God is my trust.
O put your trust in him alway, ye people: pour out your hearts before him, for
God is our hope.
As for the children of men, they are but vanity: the children of men are deceitful
upon the weights, they are altogether lighter than vanity itself.
O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselves unto vanity: if riches
increase, set not your heart upon them.
God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same: that power belongeth
unto God;
And that thou, Lord, art merciful: for thou rewardest every man according to his
work.
<h3>Psalm 62</h3>
A psalm of David. When he was in the wilderness of Idumea
O GOD, thou art my God: early will I seek thee.
My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee: in a barren and dry
land where no water is.
Thus have I looked for thee in holiness: that I might behold thy power and glory.
For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: my lips shall praise thee.
As long as I live will I magnify thee on this manner: and lift up my hands in thy
Name.
My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness: when my
mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.
Have I not remembered thee in my bed: and thought upon thee when I was
waking?
Because thou hast been my helper: therefore under the shadow of thy wings will
I rejoice.
My soul hangeth upon thee: thy right hand hath upholden me.
These also that seek the hurt of my soul: they shall go under the earth.
Let them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be a portion for foxes.
But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him shall be
commended: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
<h3>Psalm 63</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the gathering together of the froward: and from the insurrection of
wicked doers;
Who have whet their tongue like a sword: and shoot out their arrows, even bitter
words;
That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: suddenly do they hit him, and
fear not.
They encourage themselves in mischief: and commune among themselves how
they may lay snares, and say that no man shall see them.
They imagine wickedness, and practise it: that they keep secret among
themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.
But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow: that they shall be
wounded.
Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall insomuch that whoso seeth them
shall laugh them to scorn.
And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done: for they shall perceive that
it is his work.
The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and put his trust in him: and all they that
are true of heart shall be glad.

The Bridegroom approacheth; let us light our deeds as though they were radiant lamps, that together we may enter the divine bridal-chamber.

<h3>Psalm 64</h3>
For the end. A psalm and song of David
THOU, O God, art praised in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed in
Jerusalem.
Thou that hearest the prayer: unto thee shall all flesh come.
My misdeeds prevail against me: O be thou merciful unto our sins.
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: he shall dwell
in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house, even of
thy holy temple.
Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation: thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that remain in the broad sea.
Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains: and is girded about with power.
Who stilleth the raging of the sea: and the noise of his waves, and the madness of
the people.
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afraid at thy
tokens: thou that makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
praise thee.
Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very plenteous.
The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest
for the earth.
Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof: thou
makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop fatness.
They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and the little hills shall
rejoice on every side.
The folds shall be full of sheep: the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn,
that they shall laugh and sing.
<h3>Psalm 65</h3>
For the end. A song of a plasm of resurrection
O BE joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of his Name, make
his praise to be glorious.
Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the greatness of
thy power shall thine enemies be found liars unto thee.
For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy Name.
O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is in his doing
toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the water on foot;
there did we rejoice thereof.
He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people: and such as will
not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.
O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to slip.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our loins.
Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water, and
thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay thee my vows, which I
promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of rams: I will offer
bullocks and goats.
O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what he hath
done for my soul.
I called unto him with my mouth: and gave him praises with my tongue.
If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart: the Lord will not hear me.
But God hath heard me: and considered the voice of my prayer.
Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned his mercy from me.
<h3>Psalm 66</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns
GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his countenance,
and be merciful unto us:
That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the folk righteously,
and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God, shall
give us his blessing.
God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 67</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song of David
LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee
before him.
Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away: and like as wax
melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the presence of God.
But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them also be merry and
joyful .
O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name: magnify him that rideth upon
the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise him in his Name JAH, and
rejoice before him.
He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows: even God
in his holy habitation.
He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the
prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates continue in scarceness.
O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through
the wilderness;
The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God: even as Sinai
also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.
Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreshedst it
when it was weary.
Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness
prepared for the poor.
The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers.
Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited: and they of the household
divided the spoil.
Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove: that
is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.
When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake: then were they as white as
snow in Salmon.
As the hill of Basan, so is God's hill: even an high hill, as the hill of Basan.
Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which it pleaseth him to
dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: and the Lord
is among them, as in the holy place of Sinai.
Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for
men: yea, even for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among
them.
Praised be the Lord daily: even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his benefits
upon us.
He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is the Lord, by
whom we escape death.
God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalp of such a one as
goeth on still in his wickedness.
The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan: mine own
will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the tongue of
thy dogs may be red through the same.
It is well seen, O God, how thou goest: how thou, my God and King, goest in the
sanctuary.
The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the damsels
playing with the timbrels.
Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations: from the ground
of the heart.
There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their counsel: the
princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.
Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing, O God, that thou
hast wrought in us,
For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem: so shall kings bring presents unto thee.
When the company of the spear-men, and multitude of the mighty are scattered
abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they humbly bring pieces of
silver: and when he hath scattered the people that delight in war;
Then shall the princes come out of Eqypt: the Morians' land shall soon stretch
our her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord;
Who sitteth in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he doth send out his
voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.
Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel: his worship and strength is in the
clouds.
O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: even the God of Israel, he will give
strength and power unto his people; blessed be God.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 68</h3>
For the end. A Psalm of David for alternate verses
SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.
I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is: I am come into deep waters, so
that the floods run over me.
I am weary of crying; my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for waiting so long
upon my God.
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that
are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.
I paid them the things that I never took: God, thou knowest my simpleness, and
my faults are not hid from thee.
Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my cause:
let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of
Israel.
And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof: shame hath covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an alien unto my mother's
children.
For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me: and the rebukes of them that
rebuked thee are fallen upon me.
I wept, and chastened myself with fasting: and that was turned to my reproof.
I put on sackcloth also: and they jested upon me.
They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs upon
me.
But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.
Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the truth of thy salvation.
Take me out of the mire, that I sink not: O let me be delivered from them that
hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up: and let
not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable: turn thee unto me
according to the multitude of thy mercies.
And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: O haste thee, and
hear me.
Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: O deliver me, because of mine enemies.
Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are
all in thy sight.
Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to
have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.
They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and let the things that
should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.
Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not: and ever bow thou down their backs.
Pour out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold
of them.
Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they talk how they may vex
them whom thou hast wounded.
Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and not come into thy
righteousness.
Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be written among the
righteous.
As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God, shall lift me up.
I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with thanksgiving.
This also shall please the Lord: better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God, and your soul
shall live.
For the Lord heareth the poor: and despiseth not his prisoners.
Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea, and all that moveth therein.
For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah: that men may dwell there,
and have it in possession.
The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his Name
shall dwell therein.
<h3>Psalm 69</h3>
For the end. By David for a remembrance; that the Lord may save me
HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned
backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.
Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame: that cry over me, There,
there.
But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let all such as
delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and in misery: haste thee unto me, O God.
Thou art my helper and my redeemer: O Lord, make no long tarrying.

<h3>Psalm 70</h3>
By David. A psalm sung by the sons of Jonadab and the first that were taken captive
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: but rid
me and deliver me in thy righteousness, incline thine ear unto me, and save
me.
Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may alway resort: thou hast promised to
help me, for thou art my house of defence and my castle.
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the hand of the
unrighteous and cruel man.
For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope, even from
my youth.
Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: thou art he that took
me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall be always of thee.
I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is in thee.
O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy glory and honour
all the day long.
Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength faileth
me.
For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul take their
counsel together, saying: God hath forsaken him; persecute him, and take
him, for there is none to deliver him.
Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me.
Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul: let them be covered
with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.
As for me, I will patiently abide alway: and will praise thee more and more.
My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation: for I know no end
thereof.
I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy
righteousness only.
Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I tell of
thy wondrous works.
Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed: until I have
shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that
are yet for to come.
Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are they that thou hast
done; O God, who is like unto thee?
O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me, and yet didst thou
turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth
again.
Thou hast brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every side.
Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an
instrument of musick: unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Holy One
of Israel.
My lips will be fain when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul whom thou hast
delivered.
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are
confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.
<h3>Psalm 71</h3>
For Solomon
GIVE the King thy judgements, O God: and thy righteousness unto the King's
son.
Then shall he judge thy people according unto right: and defend the poor.
The mountains also shall bring peace: and the little hills righteousness unto the
people.
He shall keep the simple folk by their right: defend the children of the poor, and
punish the wrong-doer.
They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth: from one generation
to another.
He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool: even as the drops that
water the earth.
In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea, and abundance of peace, so long as
the moon endureth.
His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other: and from the flood unto
the world's end.
They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him: his enemies shall lick
the dust.
The kings of Tharsis and of the isles shall give presents: the kings of Arabia and
Saba shall bring gifts.
All kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do him service.
For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth: the needy also, and him that hath
no helper.
He shall be favourable to the simple and needy: and shall preserve the souls of
the poor.
He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong: and dear shall their blood
be in his sight.
He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia: prayer shall be
made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.
There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills: his fruit shall
shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city like grass upon the earth.
His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the
posterities: which shall be blessed through him; and all the heathen shall
praise him.
Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel: which only doeth wondrous
things;
And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: and all the earth shall be filled
with his majesty. Amen, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 72</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
TRULY God is loving unto Israel: even unto such as are of a clean heart.
Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone: my treadings had well-nigh slipt.
And why? I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such
prosperity.
For they are in no peril of death: but are lusty and strong.
They come in no misfortune like other folk: neither are they plagued like other
men.
And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride: and overwhelmed with
cruelty.
Their eyes swell with fatness: and they do even what they lust.
They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy: their talking is against the
most High.
For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their tongue goeth
through the world.
Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no small advantage.
Tush, say they, how should God perceive it: is there knowledge in the most High?
Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in
possession: and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed
mine hands in innocency.
All the day long have I been punished: and chastened every morning.
Yea, and I had almost said even as they: but lo, then I should have condemned
the generation of thy children.
Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me,
Until I went into the sanctuary of God: then understood I the end of these men;
Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places: and castest them down, and
destroyest them.
O how suddenly do they consume: perish, and come to a fearful end!
Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh: so shalt thou make their image to
vanish out of the city.
Thus my heart was grieved: and it went even through my reins.
So foolish was I, and ignorant: even as it were a beast before thee.
Nevertheless, I am alway by thee: for thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel: and after that receive me with glory.
Whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth that I desire in
comparison of thee.
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my
portion for ever.
For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that
commit fornication against thee.
But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord God: and
to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
<h3>Psalm 73</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot
against the sheep of thy pasture?
O think upon thy congregation: whom thou hast purchased and redeemed of old.
Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance: and mount Sion, wherein thou hast
dwelt.
Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy: which hath done
evil in thy sanctuary.
Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations: and set up their
banners for tokens.
He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees: was known to bring it to an
excellent work.
But now they break down all the carved work thereof: with axes and hammers.
They have set fire upon thy holy places: and have defiled the dwelling-place of
thy Name, even unto the ground.
Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether: thus have
they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.
We see not our tokens, there is not one prophet more: no, not one is there among
us, that understandeth any more.
O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour: how long shall the enemy
blaspheme thy Name, for ever?
Why withdrawest thou thy hand: why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy
bosom to consume the enemy?
For God is my King of old: the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself.
Thou didst divide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the
dragons in the waters.
Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces: and gavest him to be meat for the
people in the wilderness.
Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks: thou driedst up
mighty waters.
The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked: and how the foolish
people hath blasphemed thy Name.
O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the enemies: and
forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.
Look upon the covenant: for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel
habitations.
O let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the poor and needy give praise
unto thy Name.
Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
blasphemeth thee daily.
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the presumption of them that hate thee
increaseth ever more and more.

<h3>Psalm 74</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: A psalm of a song for Asaph
UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks: yea, unto thee do we give thanks.
Thy Name also is so nigh: and that do thy wondrous works declare.
When I receive the congregation: I shall judge according unto right.
The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the pillars of it.
I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly: and to the ungodly, Set not up your horn.
Set not up your horn on high: and speak not with a stiff neck.
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west: nor yet from the
south.
And why? God is the Judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixed,
and he poureth out of the same.
As for the dregs thereof: all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and suck
them out.
But I will talk of the God of Jacob: and praise him for ever.
All the horns of the ungodly also will I break: and the horns of the righteous shall
be exalted.
<h3>Psalm 75</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns, a psalm for Asaph: A song for the Assyrian
IN JEWRY is God known: his Name is great in Israel.
At Salem is his tabernacle: and his dwelling in Sion.
There brake he the arrows of the bow: the shield, the sword, and the battle.
Thou art of more honour and might: than the hills of the robbers.
The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep: and all the men whose hands
were mighty have found nothing.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob: both the chariot and horse are fallen.
Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when thou art
angry?
Thou didst cause thy judgement to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled,
and was still;
When God arose to judgement: and to help all the meek upon earth.
The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise: and the fierceness of them shalt
thou refrain.
Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that are round about him:
bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
He shall refrain the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among the kings of the
earth.
<h3>Psalm 76</h3>
For the end. For Idithun, a psalm of Asaph
I WILL cry unto God with my voice: even unto God will I cry with my voice, and
he shall hearken unto me.
In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran and ceased not in the
night-season ; my soul refused comfort.
When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God: when my heart is vexed, I will
complain.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble, that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old: and the years that are past.
I call to remembrance my song: and in the night I commune with mine own
heart, and search out my spirits.
Will the Lord absent himself for ever: and will he be no more intreated?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly to an end for
evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his loving-kindness in
displeasure?
And I said, It is mine own infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right
hand of the most Highest.
I will remember the works of the Lord: and call to mind thy wonders of old time.
I will think also of all thy works: and my talking shall be of thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is holy: who is so great a God as our God?
Thou art the God that doeth wonders: and hast declared thy power among the
people.
Thou hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid: the depths
also were troubled.
The clouds poured out water, the air thundered: and thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: the lightnings shone upon the
ground: the earth was moved, and shook withal.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and thy footsteps are
not known.
Thou leddest thy people like sheep: by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<h3>Psalm 77</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
HEAR my law, O my people: incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hard sentences of old;
Which we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told us;
That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to come: but
to shew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he
hath done.
He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law: which he commanded our
forefathers to teach their children;
That their posterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn;
To the intent that when they came up: they might shew their children the same;
That they might put their trust in God: and not to forget the works of God, but to
keep his commandments;
And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation: a
generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not
stedfastly unto God;
Like as the children of Ephraim: who being harnessed, and carrying bows,
turned themselves back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his law;
But forgat what he had done: and the wonderful works that he had shewed for
them.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt:
even in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea, and let them go through: he made the waters to stand on an
heap.
In the day-time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night through with a
light of fire.
He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness: and gave them drink thereof, as it had
been out of the great depth.
He brought waters out of the stony rock: so that it gushed out like the rivers.
Yet for all this they sinned more against him: and provoked the most Highest in
the wilderness.
They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their lust.
They spake against God also, saying: Shall God prepare a table in the
wilderness?
He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
flowed withal: but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?
When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and
there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;
Because they believed not in God: and put not their trust in his help.
So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.
He rained down manna also upon them for to eat: and gave them food from
heaven.
So man did eat angels' food: for he sent them meat enough.
He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven: and through his power he
brought in the south-west-wind.
He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand
of the sea.
He let it fall among their tents: even round about their habitation.
So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire: they were
not disappointed of their lust.
But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon
them, and slew the wealthiest of them: yea, and smote down the chosen
men that were in Israel.
But for all this they sinned yet more: and believed not his wondrous works.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years in trouble.
When he slew them, they sought him: and turned them early, and inquired after
God.
And they remembered that God was their strength: and that the high God was
their redeemer.
Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and dissembled with him
in their tongue.
For their heart was not whole with him: neither continued they stedfast in his
covenant.
But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds: and destroyed them not.
Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not suffer his whole
displeasure to arise.
For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were even a wind that
passeth away, and cometh not again.
Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness: and grieved him in the
desert.
They turned back, and tempted God: and moved the Holy One in Israel.
They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered them from the
hand of the enemy;
How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
He turned their waters into blood: so that they might not drink of the rivers.
He sent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to destroy them.
He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar: and their labour unto the grasshopper.
He destroyed their vines with hail-stones: and their mulberry-trees with the frost.
He smote their cattle also with hail-stones: and their flocks with hot
thunderbolts.
He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure and trouble:
and sent evil angels among them.
He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death: but gave
their life over to the pestilence;
And smote all the first-born in Egypt: the most principal and mightiest in the
dwellings of Ham.
But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep: and carried them in the
wilderness like a flock.
He brought them out safely, that they should not fear: and overwhelmed their
enemies with the sea.
And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary: even to his mountain
which he purchased with his right hand.
He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land to be divided among
them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not his testimonies;
But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers: starting aside like a
broken bow.
For they grieved him with their hill-altars: and provoked him to displeasure with
their images.
When God heard this, he was wroth: and took sore displeasure at Israel.
So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that he had pitched
among men.
He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with his inheritance.
The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not given to
marriage.
Their priests were slain with the sword: and there were no widows to make
lamentation.
So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep: and like a giant refreshed with wine.
He smote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a perpetual shame.
He refused the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
But chose the tribe of Judah: even the hill of Sion which he loved.
And there he built his temple on high: and laid the foundation of it like the
ground which he hath made continually.
He chose David also his servant: and took him away from the sheep-folds.
As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him: that he might
feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
So he fed them with a faithful and true heart: and ruled them prudently with all
his power.

A psalm for Asaph
O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they
defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the
air: and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.
Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem: and there was
no man to bury them.
We are become an open shame to our enemies: a very scorn and derision unto
them that are round about us.
Lord, how long wilt thou be angry: shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?
Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee: and upon
the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.
For they have devoured Jacob: and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon: for we are
come to great misery.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: O deliver us, and be
merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake.
Wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?
O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed: be openly shewed upon
the heathen in our sight.
O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to the
greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die.
And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee: reward
thou them , O Lord, seven-fold into their bosom.
So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for
ever: and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to
generation.
<h3>Psalm 79</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses. A testimony for Asaph: a Psalm concerning the Assyrian
HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep: shew
thyself also, thou that sittest upon the cherubims.
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses: stir up thy strength, and come, and
help us.
Turn us again, O God: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
O Lord God of hosts: how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears: and givest them plenteousness of
tears to drink.
Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh us
to scorn.
Turn us again, thou God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall
be whole.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and
planted it.
Thou madest room for it: and when it had taken root it filled the land.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it: and the boughs thereof were like
the goodly cedar-trees.
She stretched out her branches unto the sea: and her boughs unto the river.
Why hast thou then broken down her hedge: that all they that go by pluck off her
grapes?
The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up: and the wild beasts of the field
devour it.
Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven: behold, and visit this
vine;
And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted: and the branch
that thou madest so strong for thyself.
It is burnt with fire, and cut down: and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy
countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man, whom
thou madest so strong for thine own self.
And so will not we go back from thee: O let us live, and we shall call upon thy
Name.
Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.
<h3>Psalm 80</h3>
For the end. A psalm for Asaph, concerning the winepresses
SING we merrily unto God our strength: make a cheerful noise unto the God of
Jacob.
Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret: the merry harp with the lute.
Blow up the trumpet in the new-moon: even in the time appointed, and upon our
solemn feast-day.
For this was made a statute for Israel: and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony: when he came out of the land of
Egypt, and had heard a strange language.
I eased his shoulder from the burden: and his hands were delivered from making
the pots.
Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee: and heard thee what
time as the storm fell upon thee.
I proved thee also: at the waters of strife.
Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel: if thou wilt hearken unto me,
There shall no strange god be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any other god.
I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy
mouth wide, and I shall fill it.
But my people would not hear my voice: and Israel would not obey me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts: and let them follow their own
imaginations.
O that my people would have hearkened unto me: for if Israel had walked in my
ways,
I should soon have put down their enemies: and turned my hand against their
adversaries.
The haters of the Lord should have been found liars: but their time should have
endured for ever.
He should have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour: and with honey out of
the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

<h3>Psalm 81</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
GOD standeth in the congregation of princes: he is a Judge among gods.
How long will ye give wrong judgement: and accept the persons of the ungodly?
Defend the poor and fatherless: see that such as are in need and necessity have
right.
Deliver the outcast and poor: save them from the hand of the ungodly.
They will not be learned nor understand, but walk on still in darkness: all the
foundations of the earth are out of course.
I have said, Ye are gods: and ye are all the children of the most Highest.
But ye shall die like men: and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth: for thou shalt take all heathen to thine
inheritance.
<h3>Psalm 82</h3>
A song of a psalm for Asaph
HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: refrain not thyself, O God.
For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring: and they that hate thee have lift up
their head.
They have imagined craftily against thy people: and taken counsel against thy
secret ones.
They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people:
and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
For they have cast their heads together with one consent: and are confederate
against thee;
The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismaelites: the Moabites and
Hagarenes;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek: the Philistines, with them that dwell at Tyre.
Assur also is joined with them: and have holpen the children of Lot.
But do thou to them as unto the Madianites: unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the
brook of Kison;
Who perished at Endor: and became as the dung of the earth.
Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeb: yea, make all their princes like
as Zeba and Salmana;
Who say, Let us take to ourselves: the houses of God in possession.
O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and as the stubble before the wind;
Like as the fire that burneth up the wood: and as the flame that consumeth the
mountains.
Persecute them even so with thy tempest: and make them afraid with thy storm.
Make their faces ashamed, O Lord: that they may seek thy Name.
Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more: let them be put to
shame, and perish.
And they shall know that thou, whose Name is Jehovah: art only the most Highest
over all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 83</h3>
For the end. A song for the sons of Core, concerning the winepresses
O HOW amiable are thy dwellings: thou Lord of hosts!
My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the Lord: my heart
and my flesh rejoice in the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest where she may
lay her young: even thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be alway praising thee.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are thy ways.
Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well: and the pools are filled
with water.
They will go from strength to strength: and unto the God of gods appeareth every
one of them in Sion.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer :hearken, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our defender: and look upon the face of thine Anointed.
For one day in thy courts: is better than a thousand.
I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God: than to dwell in the tents
of ungodliness.
For the Lord God is a light and defence: the Lord will give grace and worship,
and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a godly life.
O Lord God of hosts: blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 84</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou hast turned away the
captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people: and covered all their sins.
Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure: and turned thyself from thy wrathful
indignation.
Turn us then, O God our Saviour: and let thine anger cease from us.
Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever: and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from
one generation to another?
Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Shew us thy mercy, O Lord: and grant us thy salvation.
I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak
peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again.
For his salvation is nigh them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each
other.
Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness hath looked down from
heaven.
Yea, the Lord shall shew loving-kindness: and our land shall give her increase.
Righteousness shall go before him: and he shall direct his going in the way.

Thou didst cause the greatly painful passions to cease, O Word, and didst save mankind, whom the adversary wounded of old, yet who piously worship Thine ineffable dispensation.

O incorrupt and immaculate Virgin, disdain me not who am corrupt of mind and depraved of soul and conscience, who am defiled by evil and appear stripped bare of all good deeds; but do thou adorn me with works of piety. I have been filled with evils, filled with thoughts which alienate me from Thee the Lover of mankind; wherefore, I groan and cry aloud: Accept me, the penitent, and by the prayers of her who gave birth to Thee, reject me not, O greatly merciful Benefactor. That I may be delivered by thy prayers from all wrath, the deadly passions, cruel Gehenna and fire, from unjust men and wicked enemies, O all-immaculate Maiden, I have fled to thy protection and call upon thee for help. In that thou art the Mother of God, beseech the Lord God and King, that I, thy servant, who from my mother’s womb have set my hope on thee, may be delivered from every threat and wicked habit, O Lady.

<h3>Psalm 85</h3>
A prayer of David
BOW down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor, and in misery.
Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: my God, save thy servant that putteth his
trust in thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I will call daily upon thee.
Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, art good and gracious: and of great mercy unto all them that call
upon thee.
Give ear, Lord, unto my prayer: and ponder the voice of my humble desires.
In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou hearest me.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord: there is not one that can do
as thou doest.
All nations whom thou hadst made shall come and worship thee, O Lord: and
shall glorify thy Name.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in thy truth: O knit my heart unto
thee, that I may fear thy Name.
I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and will praise thy Name for
evermore.
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the
nethermost hell.
O God, the proud are risen against me: and the congregations of naughty men
have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.
But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, plenteous
in goodness and truth.
O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength unto thy
servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.
Shew some token upon me for good, that they who hate me may see it and be
ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
<h3>Psalm 86</h3>
A psalm of a song for the sons of Core
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loveth the gates of Sion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Very excellent things are spoken of thee: thou city of God.
I will think upon Rahab and Babylon: with them that know me.
Behold ye the Philistines also: and they of Tyre, with the Morians; lo, there was
he born.
And of Sion it shall be reported that he was born in her: and the most High shall
stablish her.
The Lord shall rehearse it when he writeth up the people: that he was born
there.
The singers also and trumpeters shall he rehearse: All my fresh springs shall be
in thee.
<h3>Psalm 87</h3>
A song of a psalm for the sons of Core. For the end. Upon Maeleth, for responsive strains.
Concerning instruction for Æman the Israelite
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: O let my
prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling.
For my soul is full of trouble: and my life draweth nigh unto hell.
I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit: and I have been even as a
man that hath no strength.
Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded, and lie in the grave: who
are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit: in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
Thine indignation lieth hard upon me: and thou hast vexed me with all thy
storms.
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me: and made me to be
abhorred of them.
I am so fast in prison: that I cannot get forth.
My sight faileth for very trouble: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have
stretched forth my hands unto thee.
Dost thou shew wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise up again, and
praise thee?
Shall thy loving-kindness be shewed in the grave: or thy faithfulness in
destruction?
Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy righteousness in the
land where all things are forgotten?
Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come before thee.
Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face from me?
I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die: even from my youth
up thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me: and the fear of thee hath undone me.
They came round about me daily like water: and compassed me together on
every side.
My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me: and hid mine acquaintance
out of my sight.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 88</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Ætham the Israelite
MY SONG shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the Lord: with my mouth will I
ever be shewing thy truth from one generation to another.
For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever: thy truth shalt thou stablish in the
heavens.
I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn unto David my servant;
Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne from one generation to
another.
O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and thy truth in the
congregation of the saints.
For who is he among the clouds: that shall be compared unto the Lord?
And what is he among the gods: that shall be like unto the Lord?
God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints: and to be had in
reverence of all them that are round about him.
O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee: thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on
every side.
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.
Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it: thou hast scattered thine enemies
abroad with thy mighty arm.
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast laid the foundation of
the round world, and all that therein is.
Thou hast made the north and the south: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy
Name.
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat: mercy and truth shall go
before thy face.
Blessed is the people, O Lord, that can rejoice in thee: they shall walk in the light
of thy countenance.
Their delight shall be daily in thy Name: and in thy righteousness shall they
make their boast.
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy loving-kindness thou shalt lift
up our horns.
For the Lord is our defence: the Holy One of Israel is our King.
Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help
upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
I have found David my servant: with my holy oil have I anointed him.
My hand shall hold him fast: and my arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not be able to do him violence: the son of wickedness shall not
hurt him.
I will smite down his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.
My truth also and my mercy shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be
exalted.
I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand in the floods.
He shall call me, Thou art my Father: my God, and my strong salvation.
And I will make him my first-born: higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast with
him.
His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the days of
heaven.
But if his children forsake my law: and walk not in my judgements;
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I will visit their
offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.
Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my
truth to fail.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: I
have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David.
His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the sun before me.
He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the faithful witness in
heaven.
But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed: and art displeased at him.
Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his crown to the ground.
Thou hast overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong holds.
All they that go by spoil him: and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all his adversaries to
rejoice.
Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword: and givest him not victory in the
battle.
Thou hast put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: and covered him with dishonour.
Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever: and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
O remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men for
nought?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death: and shall he deliver his soul
from the hand of hell?
Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses: which thou swarest unto David in thy
truth?
Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I do bear in my
bosom the rebukes of many people.
Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of
thine Anointed: Praised be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 89</h3>
A prayer of Moses the man of God
LORD, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of
men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a
watch in the night.
As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut down,
dried up and withered.
For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance.
For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our years to an end, as
it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong
that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but labour and
sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.
But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man feareth,
so is thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be glad all the
days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us: and for the years
wherein we have suffered adversity.
Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou the work
of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handywork.
<h3>Psalm 90</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the most High: shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty..
I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my strong hold: my God, in him
will I trust.
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome
pestilence.
He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers:
his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by
day;
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness that destroyeth
in the noon-day.
A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall
not come nigh thee.
Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold: and see the reward of the ungodly.
For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of defence very high.
There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou
tread under thy feet.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him
up, because he hath known my Name.
He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble; I will
deliver him, and bring him to honour.
With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation.

<h3>Psalm 91</h3>
A psalm of a song for the Sabbath-day
IT IS a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy
Name, O most Highest.
To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning: and of thy truth in the nightseason.
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute: upon a loud instrument,
and upon the harp.
For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works: and I will rejoice in giving
praise for the operations of thy hands.
O Lord, how glorious are thy works: thy thoughts are very deep.
An unwise man doth not well consider this: and a fool doth not understand it.
When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish: then shall they be destroyed for ever; but thou,
Lord, art the most Highest for evermore.
For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, lo, thine enemies shall perish: and all the workers
of wickedness shall be destroyed.
But mine horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn: for I am anointed with
fresh oil.
Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies: and mine ear shall hear his
desire of the wicked that arise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar
in Libanus.
Such as are planted in the house of the Lord: shall flourish in the courts of the
house of our God.
They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age: and shall be fat and wellliking.
That they may shew how true the Lord my strength is: and that there is no
unrighteousness in him.
<h3>Psalm 92</h3>
For the day before the Sabbath. When the land was first inhabited, the praise of a song by David
THE Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his
apparel, and girded himself with strength.
He hath made the round world so sure: that it cannot be moved.
Ever since the world began hath thy seat been prepared: thou art from
everlasting.
The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lift up their voice: the floods lift up
their waves.
The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly: but yet the Lord, who
dwelleth on high, is mightier.
Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becometh thine house for ever.
<h3>Psalm 93</h3>
A psalm of David for the fourth day of the week
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth: thou God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself.
Arise, thou Judge of the world: and reward the proud after their deserving.
Lord, how long shall the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly triumph?
How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully: and make such proud
boasting?
They smite down thy people, O Lord: and trouble thine heritage.
They murder the widow and the stranger: and put the fatherless to death.
And yet they say, Tush, the Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob
regard it.
Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the eye, shall he not
see?
Or he that nurtureth the heathen: it is he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not
he punish?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man: that they are but vain.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him in thy law.
That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity: until the pit be digged
up for the ungodly.
For the Lord will not fail his people: neither will he forsake his inheritance;
Until righteousness turn again unto judgement: all such as are true in heart shall
follow it.
Who will rise up with me against the wicked: or who will take my part against
the evil-doers?
If the Lord had not helped me: it had not failed but my soul had been put to
silence.
But when I said, My foot hath slipt: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.
In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart: thy comforts have
refreshed my soul.
Wilt thou have any thing to do with the stool of wickedness: which imagineth
mischief as a law?
They gather them together against the soul of the righteous: and condemn the
innocent blood.
But the Lord is my refuge: and my God is the strength of my confidence.
He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own
malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

<h3>Psalm 94</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
O COME, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our
salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: and shew ourselves glad in
him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God: and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hills is his
also.
The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep
of his hand.
To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the provocation,
and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: It is a people that
do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways;
Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.
<h3>Psalm 95</h3>
When the house was built after the captivity. A song by David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the whole earth.
Sing unto the Lord, and praise his Name: be telling of his salvation from day to
day.
Declare his honour unto the heathen: and his wonders unto all people.
For the Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised: he is more to be feared
than all gods.
As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols: but it is the Lord that made
the heavens.
Glory and worship are before him: power and honour are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people: ascribe unto the Lord
worship and power.
Ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his Name: bring presents, and come
into his courts.
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let the whole earth stand in awe of
him.
Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King: and that it is he who hath
made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; and how that he
shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea make a noise, and
all that therein is.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood
rejoice before the Lord.
For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: and with righteousness to judge
the world, and the people with his truth.
<h3>Psalm 96</h3>
For David, when his land is established
THE Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
may be glad thereof.
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgement are the
habitation of his seat.
There shall go a fire before him: and burn up his enemies on every side.
His lightnings gave shine unto the world: the earth saw it, and was afraid.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord
of the whole earth.
The heavens have declared his righteousness: and all the people have seen his
glory.
Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in vain
gods: worship him, all ye gods.
Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad, because of
thy judgements, O Lord.
For thou, Lord, art higher than all that are in the earth: thou art exalted far
above all gods.
O ye that love the Lord, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: the Lord
preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of
the ungodly.
There is sprung up a light for the righteous: and the joyful gladness for such as
are true-hearted.
Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous: and give thanks for a remembrance of his
holiness.

<h3>Psalm 97</h3>
A Psalm of David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous things.
With his own right hand, and with his holy arm: hath he gotten himself the
victory.
The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the
sight of the heathen.
He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel: and all the
ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.
Shew yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing, rejoice, and give thanks.
Praise the Lord upon the harp: sing to the harp with a psalm of thanksgiving.
With trumpets also and shawms: O shew yourselves joyful before the Lord the
King.
Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round world, and they that
dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together before the
Lord: for he is come to judge the earth.
With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with equity.
<h3>Psalm 98</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord is King, be the people never so unpatient: he sitteth between the
cherubims, be the earth never so unquiet.
The Lord is great in Sion: and high above all people.
They shall give thanks unto thy Name: which is great, wonderful, and holy.
The King's power loveth judgement; thou hast prepared equity: thou hast
executed judgement and righteousness in Jacob.
O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before his footstool, for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call upon his
Name: these called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar: for they kept his testimonies, and
the law that he gave them.
Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou forgavest them, O God, and
punishedst their own inventions.
O magnify the Lord our God, and worship him upon his holy hill: for the Lord our
God is holy.
<h3>Psalm 99</h3>
A psalm for thanksgiving
O BE joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come
before his presence with a song.
Be ye sure that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we
ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:
be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.
For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting: and his truth endureth from
generation to generation.
<h3>Psalm 100</h3>
A Psalm of David
MY SONG shall be of mercy and judgement: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.
O let me have understanding: in the way of godliness.
When wilt thou come unto me: I will walk in my house with a perfect heart.
I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of unfaithfulness: there shall
no such cleave unto me.
A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour: him will I destroy.
Whoso hath also a proud look and high stomach: I will not suffer him.
Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land: that they may dwell with
me.
Whoso leadeth a godly life: he shall be my servant.
There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house: he that telleth lies shall not
tarry in my sight.
I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land: that I may root out all
wicked doers from the city of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 101</h3>
A prayer for the poor, when he is deeply afflicted and pours out his supplication before the Lord
HEAR my prayer, O Lord: and let my crying come unto thee.
Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine ear unto me
when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.
For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt up as it
were a firebrand.
My heart is smitten down, and withered liked grass: so that I forget to eat my
bread.
For the voice of my groaning: my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.
I am become like a pelican in the wilderness: and like an owl that is in the desert.
I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that sitteth alone upon the
house-top.
Mine enemies revile me all the day long: and they that are mad upon me are
sworn together against me.
For I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping.
And that because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and
cast me down.
My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.
But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever: and thy remembrance throughout all
generations.
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that thou have mercy
upon her, yea, the time is come.
And why? thy servants think upon her stones: and it pitieth them to see her in
the dust.
The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy
majesty;
When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall appear;
When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute: and despiseth not
their desire.
This shall be written for those that come after: and the people which shall be
born shall praise the Lord.
For he hath looked down from his sanctuary: out of the heaven did the Lord
behold the earth;
That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity: and deliver the
children appointed unto death;
That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion: and his worship at
Jerusalem;
When the people are gathered together: and the kingdoms also, to serve the
Lord.
He brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.
But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age: as for thy
years, they endure throughout all generations.
Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax old as doth a
garment;
And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art
the same, and thy years shall not fail.
The children of thy servants shall continue: and their seed shall stand fast in thy
sight.
<h3>Psalm 102</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me praise his holy Name.
Praise the Lord, O my soul: and forget not all his benefits;
Who forgiveth all thy sin: and healeth all thine infirmities;
Who saveth thy life from destruction: and crowneth thee with mercy and lovingkindness;
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: making thee young and lusty as an
eagle.
The Lord executeth righteousness and judgement: for all them that are
oppressed with wrong.
He shewed his ways unto Moses: his works unto the children of Israel.
The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and of great goodness.
He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth he his anger for ever.
He hath not dealt with us after our sins: nor rewarded us according to our
wickednesses.
For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth: so great is his mercy
also toward them that fear him.
Look how wide also the east is from the west: so far hath he set our sins from us.
Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children: even so is the Lord merciful unto
them that fear him.
For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that we are but dust.
The days of man are but as grass: for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.
For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone: and the place thereof shall know
it no more.
But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon them that
fear him: and his righteousness upon children's children;
Even upon such as keep his covenant: and think upon his commandments to do
them.
The Lord hath prepared his seat in heaven: and his kingdom ruleth over all.
O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength: ye that fulfil his
commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words.
O praise the Lord, all ye his hosts: ye servants of his that do his pleasure.
O speak good of the Lord, all ye works of his, in all places of his dominion: praise
thou the Lord, O my soul.

<h3>Psalm 103</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art become exceeding
glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.
Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment: and spreadest out the
heavens like a curtain.
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: and maketh the clouds his
chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.
He maketh his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire.
He laid the foundations of the earth: that it never should move at any time.
Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment: the waters stand in the
hills.
At thy rebuke they flee: at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.
They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath: even unto the
place which thou hast appointed for them.
Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass: neither turn again to
cover the earth.
He sendeth the springs into the rivers: which run among the hills.
All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild asses quench their thirst.
Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation: and sing among the
branches.
He watereth the hills from above: the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
He bringeth forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the service of men;
That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of
man: and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen
man's heart.
The trees of the Lord also are full of sap: even the cedars of Libanus which he
hath planted;
Wherein the birds make their nests: and the fir-trees are a dwelling for the stork.
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats: and so are the stony rocks for the
conies.
He appointed the moon for certain seasons: and the sun knoweth his going down.
Thou makest darkness that it may be night: wherein all the beasts of the forest
do move.
The lions roaring after their prey: do seek their meat from God.
The sun ariseth, and they get them away together: and lay them down in their
dens.
Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour: until the evening.
O Lord, how manifold are thy works: in wisdom hast thou made them all; the
earth is full of thy riches.
So is the great and wide sea also: wherein are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great beasts.
There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan: whom thou hast made to take his
pastime therein.
These wait all upon thee: that thou mayest give them meat in due season.
When thou givest it them they gather it: and when thou openest thy hand they
are filled with good.
When thou hidest thy face they are troubled: when thou takest away their breath
they die, and are turned again to their dust.
When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made: and thou shalt renew
the face of the earth.
The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in
his works.
The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch the hills, they shall
smoke.
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will praise my God while I have my
being.
And so shall my words please him: my joy shall be in the Lord.
As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall
come to an end: praise thou the Lord, O my soul, praise the Lord.

Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his Name: tell the people what
things he hath done.
O let your songs be of him, and praise him: and let your talking be of all his
wondrous works.
Rejoice in his holy Name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek the Lord and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Remember the marvellous works that he hath done: his wonders, and the
judgements of his mouth.
O ye seed of Abraham his servant: ye children of Jacob his chosen.
He is the Lord our God: his judgements are in all the world.
He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise: that he made to a
thousand generations;
Even the covenant that he made with Abraham: and the oath that he sware unto
Isaac;
And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law: and to Israel for an everlasting
testament;
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan: the lot of your inheritance;
When there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in the land;
What time as they went from one nation to another: from one kingdom to another
people;
He suffered no man to do them wrong: but reproved even kings for their sakes;
Touch not mine Anointed: and do my prophets no harm.
Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land: and destroyed all the provision of
bread.
But he had sent a man before them: even Joseph, who was sold to be a bondservant;
Whose feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his soul;
Until the time came that his cause was known: the word of the Lord tried him.
The king sent, and delivered him: the prince of the people let him go free.
He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his substance;
That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach his senators wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people exceedingly: and made them stronger than their
enemies.
Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people: and dealt untruly with his
servants.
Then sent he Moses his servant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.
And these shewed his tokens among them: and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and it was dark: and they were not obedient unto his word.
He turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs: yea, even in their kings' chambers.
He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies: and lice in all their
quarters.
He gave them hail-stones for rain: and flames of fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and fig-trees: and destroyed the trees that were in
their coasts.
He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable:
and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their
ground.
He smote all the first-born in their land: even the chief of all their strength.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person
among their tribes.
Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were afraid of them.
He spread out a cloud to be a covering: and fire to give light in the night-season.
At their desire he brought quails: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in the
dry places.
For why? he remembered his holy promise: and Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy: and his chosen with gladness.
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people
in possession;
That they might keep his statutes: and observe his laws.

<h3>Psalm 105</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for
ever.
Who can express the noble acts of the Lord: or shew forth all his praise?
Blessed are they that alway keep judgement: and do righteousness.
Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation;
That I may see the felicity of thy chosen: and rejoice in the gladness of thy
people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers: we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly.
Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great
goodness in remembrance: but were disobedient at the sea, even at the
Red sea.
Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake: that he might make his power
to be known.
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the
deep, as through a wilderness.
And he saved them from the adversaries' hand: and delivered them from the
hand of the enemy.
As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them: there was not
one of them left.
Then believed they his words: and sang praise unto him.
But within a while they forgat his works: and would not abide his counsel.
But lust came upon them in the wilderness: and they tempted God in the desert.
And he gave them their desire: and sent leanness withal into their soul.
They angered Moses also in the tents: and Aaron the saint of the Lord.
So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of
Abiram.
And the fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the ungodly.
They made a calf in Horeb: and worshipped the molten image.
Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.
And they forgat God their Saviour: who had done so great things in Egypt;
Wondrous works in the land of Ham: and fearful things by the Red sea.
So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood
before him in the gap: to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should
destroy them.
Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no credence unto his
word;
But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord.
Then lift he up his hand against them: to overthrow them in the wilderness;
To cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves unto Baal-peor: and ate the offerings of the dead.
Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions: and the plague was
great among them.
Then stood up Phinees and prayed: and so the plague ceased.
And that was counted unto him for righteousness: among all posterities for
evermore.
They angered him also at the waters of strife: so that he punished Moses for
their sakes;
Because they provoked his spirit: so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Neither destroyed they the heathen: as the Lord commanded them;
But were mingled among the heathen: and learned their works.
Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay: yea,
they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters:
whom they had offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled
with blood.
Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring with their own
inventions.
Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people: insomuch that
he abhorred his own inheritance.
And he gave them over into the hands of the heathen: and they that hated them
were lords over them.
Their enemies oppressed them: and had them in subjection.
Many a time did he deliver them: but they rebelled against him with their own
inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.
Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity: he heard their complaint.
He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude of
his mercies: yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity
them.
Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen: that we may
give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world without end: and
let all the people say, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 106</h3>
Alleluia
Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed: and delivered from the
hand of the enemy;
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west: from the
north and from the south.
They went astray in the wilderness out of the way: and found no city to dwell in;
Hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.
So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: and he delivered them from their
distress.
He led them forth by the right way: that they might go to the city where they
dwelt.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he satisfieth the empty soul: and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: being fast bound in misery
and iron ;
Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly regarded the
counsel of the most Highest;
He also brought down their heart through heaviness: they fell down, and there
was none to help them.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death: and brake
their bonds in sunder.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he hath broken the gates of brass: and smitten the bars of iron in sunder.
Foolish men are plagued for their offence: and because of their wickedness.
Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they were even hard at death's door.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
He sent his word, and healed them: and they were saved from their destruction.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving: and tell out his
works with gladness!
They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their business in great waters;
These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.
For at his word the stormy wind ariseth: which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep: their soul
melteth away because of the trouble.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are at their wits' end.
So when thy cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivereth them out of their
distress.
For he maketh the storm to cease: so that the waves thereof are still.
Then are they glad, because they are at rest: and so he bringeth them unto the
haven where they would be.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people: and praise him
in the seat of the elders!
Who turneth the floods into a wilderness: and drieth up the water-springs.
A fruitful land maketh he barren: for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water: and water-springs of a dry
ground.
And there he setteth the hungry: that they may build them a city to dwell in.
That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards: to yield them fruits of
increase.
He blesseth them so that they multiply exceedingly: and suffereth not their cattle
to decrease.
And again, when they are minished and brought low: through oppression,
through any plague or trouble;
Though he suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants: and let them wander
out of the way in the wilderness.
Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery: and maketh him households like a flock of
sheep.
The righteous will consider this, and rejoice: and the mouth of all wickedness
shall be stopped.
Whoso is wise will ponder these things: and they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 107</h3>
Song of a psalm by David
O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing and give praise with the
best member that I have.
Awake, thou lute, and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing praises unto
thee among the nations.
For thy mercy is greater than the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
That thy beloved may be delivered: let thy right hand save them, and hear thou
me.
God hath spoken in his holiness: I will rejoice therefore, and divide Sichem, and
mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head.
Judah is my law-giver, Moab is my wash-pot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe,
upon Philistia will I triumph.
Who will lead me into the strong city: and who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou forsaken us, O God: and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our
hosts?
O help us against the enemy: for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do great acts: and it is he that shall tread down our
enemies.
<h3>Psalm 108</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise: for the mouth of the ungodly, yea, the
mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.
And they have spoken against me with false tongues: they compassed me about
also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part: but I give
myself unto prayer.
Thus have they rewarded me evil for good: and hatred for my good will.
Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand.
When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned: and let his prayer be
turned into sin.
Let his days be few: and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless: and his wife a widow.
Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread: let them seek it also out of
desolate places.
Let the extortioner consume all that he hath: and let the stranger spoil his
labour.
Let there be no man to pity him: nor to have compassion upon his fatherless
children.
Let his posterity be destroyed: and in the next generation let his name be clean
put out.
Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight of the Lord:
and let not the sin of his mother be done away.
Let them alway be before the Lord: that he may root out the memorial of them
from off the earth.
And that, because his mind was not to do good: but persecuted the poor helpless
man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.
His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him: he loved not blessing,
therefore shall it be far from him.
He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a raiment: and it shall come into his
bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be unto him as the cloke that he hath upon him: and as the girdle that he is
alway girded withal.
Let it thus happen from the Lord unto mine enemies: and to those that speak evil
against my soul.
But deal thou with me, O Lord God, according unto thy Name: for sweet is thy
mercy.
O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor: and my heart is wounded within me.
I go hence like the shadow that departeth: and am driven away as the
grasshopper.
My knees are weak through fasting: my flesh is dried up for want of fatness.
I became also a reproach unto them: they that looked upon me shaked their
heads.
Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy.
And they shall know, how that this is thy hand: and that thou, Lord, hast done it.
Though they curse, yet bless thou: and let them be confounded that rise up
against me; but let thy servant rejoice.
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame: and let them cover themselves with
their own confusion, as with a cloke.
As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth: and praise him
among the multitude.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor: to save his soul from the
unrighteous judges.

Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, laud ye the Name of the Lord: praise it, O ye servants of the
Lord;
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord: in the courts of the house of our God.
O praise the Lord, for the Lord is gracious: O sing praises unto his Name, for it is
lovely.
For why? the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself: and Israel for his own
possession.
For I know that the Lord is great: and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth: and in the sea,
and in all deep places.
He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world: and sendeth forth
lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his treasures.
He smote the first-born of Egypt: both of man and beast.
He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of Egypt:
upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.
He smote divers nations: and slew mighty kings;
Sehon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Basan: and all the kingdoms of
Canaan;
And gave their land to be an heritage: even an heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever: so doth thy memorial, O Lord, from one
generation to another.
For the Lord will avenge his people: and be gracious unto his servants.
As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold: the work of men's
hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, but they see not.
They have ears, and yet they hear not: neither is there any breath in their
mouths.
They that make them are like unto them: and so are all they that put their trust
in them.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Israel: praise the Lord, ye house of Aaron.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, praise the Lord.
Praised be the Lord out of Sion: who dwelleth at Jerusalem.

Who only doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who by his excellent wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who laid out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who hath made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The sun to rule the day: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The moon and the stars to govern the night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote Egypt with their first-born: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever;
With a mighty hand, and stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who divided the Red sea in two parts: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And made Israel to go through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever.
But as for Pharaoh and his host, he overthrew them in the Red sea: for his mercy
endureth for ever.
Who led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.

O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 136</h3>
For David. A psalm of Jeremias
BY THE waters of Babylon we sat down and wept: when we remembered thee, O
Sion.
As for our harps, we hanged them up: upon the trees that are therein.
For they that led us away captive required of us then a song, and melody in our
heaviness: Sing us one of the songs of Sion.
How shall we sing the Lord's song: in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem: let my right hand forget her cunning.
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: yea, if I
prefer not Jerusalem in my mirth.
Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem: how they said,
Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.
O daughter of Babylon , wasted with misery: yea, happy shall he be that
rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us.
Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children: and throweth them against the
stones.

<h3>Psalm 137</h3>
A psalm of David, of Aggæus and Zacharias
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: even before the gods
will I sing praise unto thee.
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of thy
loving-kindness and truth: for thou hast magnified thy Name and thy word
above all things.
When I called upon thee, thou heardest me: and enduedst my soul with much
strength.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they have heard the words
of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: that great is the glory of the Lord.
For though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: as for the
proud, he beholdeth them afar off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me: thou shalt
stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy right
hand shall save me.
The lord shall make good his loving-kindness toward me: yea, thy mercy, O Lord,
endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine own hands.
<h3>Psalm 138</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
O LORD, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou knowest my downsitting and mine up-rising, thou understandest my thoughts long before.
Thou art about my path, and about my bed: and spiest out all my ways.
For lo, there is not a word in my tongue: but thou, O Lord, knowest it altogether.
Thou hast fashioned me behind and before: and laid thine hand upon me.
Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me: I cannot attain unto it.
Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit: or whither shall I go then from thy
presence?
If I climb up into heaven, thou art there: if I go down to hell, thou art there also.
If I take the wings of the morning: and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me.
If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall my night be turned
to day.
Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day:
the darkness and light to thee are both alike.
For my reins are thine: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous
are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.
My bones are not hid from thee: though I be made secretly, and fashioned
beneath in the earth.
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect: and in thy book were all
my members written;
Which day by day were fashioned: when as yet there was none of them.
How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God: O how great is the sum of them!
If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: when I wake up I am
present with thee.
Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God: depart from me, ye blood-thirsty men.
For they speak unrighteously against thee: and thine enemies take thy Name in
vain.
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee: and am not I grieved with those that
rise up against thee?
Yea, I hate them right sore: even as though they were mine enemies.
Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart: prove me, and examine my
thoughts.
Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me: and lead me in the way
everlasting.
<h3>Psalm 139</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
DELIVER me, O Lord, from the evil man: and preserve me from the wicked man.
Who imagine mischief in their hearts: and stir up strife all the day long.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: adders' poison is under their
lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly: preserve me from the wicked
men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.
The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with cords: yea, and
set traps in my way.
I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my prayers, O Lord.
O Lord God, thou strength of my health: thou hast covered my head in the day of
the battle.
Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord: let not his mischievous imagination
prosper, lest they be too proud.
Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them: that compass me
about.
Let hot burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire and into the
pit, that they never rise up again.
A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: evil shall hunt the wicked
person to overthrow him.
Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor: and maintain the cause of the
helpless.
The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name: and the just shall continue in
thy sight.

<h3>Psalm 140</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, I call upon thee, haste thee unto me: and consider my voice when I cry
unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense: and let the lifting up of my
hands be an evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and keep the door of my lips.
O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing: let me not be occupied in
ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, lest I eat of such things
as please them.
Let the righteous rather smite me friendly: and reprove me.
But let not their precious balms break my head: yea, I will pray yet against their
wickedness.
Let their judges be overthrown in stony places: that they may hear my words, for
they are sweet.
Our bones lie scattered before the pit: like as when one breaketh and heweth
wood upon the earth.
But mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust , O cast not out my
soul.
Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me: and from the traps of the
wicked doers.
Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together: and let me ever escape them.
<h3>Psalm 141</h3>
A psalm of instruction for David. When he was in the cave; a prayer
I CRIED unto the Lord with my voice: yea, even unto the Lord did I make my
supplication.
I poured out my complaints before him: and shewed him of my trouble.
When my spirit was in heaviness thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I
walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
I looked also upon my right hand: and saw there was no man that would know
me.
I had no place to flee unto: and no man cared for my soul.
I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said: Thou art my hope, and my portion in the land
of the living.
Consider my complaint: for I am brought very low.
O deliver me from my persecutors: for they are too strong for me.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name: which thing if
thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto my company.
<h3>Psalm 142</h3>
A psalm of David when his son pursued him
HEAR my prayer, O Lord, and consider my desire: hearken unto me for thy truth
and righteousness' sake.
And enter not into judgement with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
living be justified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the
ground: he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have been long
dead.
Therefore is my spirit vexed within me: and my heart within me is desolate.
Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works: yea, I exercise
myself in the works of thy hands.
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.
Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint: hide not thy face from
me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for in thee is my trust:
shew thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I flee unto thee to hide me.
Teach me to do a thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God: let thy loving
Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.
Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name's sake: and for thy righteousness' sake bring
my soul out of trouble.
And of thy goodness slay mine enemies: and destroy all them that vex my soul ;
for I am thy servant.

A psalm of David concerning Goliath
BLESSED be the Lord my strength: who teacheth my hands to war, and my
fingers to fight.
My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in whom I trust:
who subdueth my people that is under me.
Lord, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him: or the son of man, that
thou so regardest him?
Man is like a thing of nought: his time passeth away like a shadow.
Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall
smoke.
Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them: shoot out thine arrows, and consume
them.
Send down thine hand from above: deliver me, and take me out of the great
waters, from the hand of strange children.
Whose mouth talketh of vanity: and their right hand is a right hand of
wickedness.
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: and sing praises unto thee upon a tenstringed lute.
Thou hast given victory unto kings: and hast delivered David thy servant from
the peril of the sword.
Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children: whose mouth talketh
of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.
That our sons may grow up as the young plants: and that our daughters may be
as the polished corners of the temple.
That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of store: that our
sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets.
That our oxen may be strong to labour, that there be no decay: no leading into
captivity, and no complaining in our streets.
Happy are the people that are in such a case: yea, blessed are the people who
have the Lord for their God.
<h3>Psalm 144</h3>
David's Psalm of praise
I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King: and I will praise thy Name for ever and
ever.
Every day will I give thanks unto thee: and praise thy Name for ever and ever.
Great is the Lord, and marvellous worthy to be praised: there is no end of his
greatness.
One generation shall praise thy works unto another: and declare thy power.
As for me, I will be talking of thy worship: thy glory, thy praise, and wondrous
works;
So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts: and I will also tell of
thy greatness.
The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be shewed: and men shall sing of
thy righteousness.
The Lord is gracious and merciful: long-suffering and of great goodness.
The Lord is loving unto every man: and his mercy is over all his works.
All thy works praise thee, O Lord: and thy saints give thanks unto thee.
They shew the glory of thy kingdom: and talk of thy power;
That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom: might be known unto
men.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom: and thy dominion endureth throughout
all ages.
The Lord upholdeth all such as fall: and lifteth up all those that are down.
The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord: and thou givest them their meat in due
season.
Thou openest thine hand: and fillest all things living with plenteousness.
The Lord is righteous in all his ways: and holy in all his works.
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: yea, all such as call upon him
faithfully.
He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will
help them.
The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but scattereth abroad all the
ungodly.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh give thanks unto his
holy Name for ever and ever.

<h3>Psalm 145</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul; while I live will I praise the Lord: yea, as long as I
have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.
O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man: for there is no help in
them.
For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn again to his earth: and then
all his thoughts perish.
Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help: and whose hope is in the
Lord his God;
Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: who keepeth his
promise for ever;
Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong: who feedeth the hungry.
The Lord looseth men out of prison: the Lord giveth sight to the blind.
The Lord helpeth them that are fallen: the Lord careth for the righteous.
The Lord careth for the strangers, he defendeth the fatherless and widow :as for
the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.
The Lord thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore: and throughout all
generations.
<h3>Psalm 146</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God: yea, a
joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: and gather together the out-casts of Israel.
He healeth those that are broken in heart: and giveth medicine to heal their
sickness.
He telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and great is his power: yea, and his wisdom is infinite.
The Lord setteth up the meek: and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground.
O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving: sing praises upon the harp unto our God;
Who covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth: and
maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men;
Who giveth fodder unto the cattle: and feedeth the young ravens that call upon
him.
He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse: neither delighteth he in any
man's legs.
But the Lord's delight is in them that fear him: and put their trust in his mercy.
<h3>Psalm 147</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.
For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates: and hath blessed thy children within
thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: and his word runneth very
swiftly.
He giveth snow like wool: and scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who is able to abide his frost?
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he bloweth with his wind, and the
waters flow.
He sheweth his word unto Jacob: his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with any nation: neither have the heathen knowledge of his
laws.

Praise him, all ye heavens: and ye waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the Name of the Lord: for he spake the word, and they were

He hath made them fast for ever and ever: he hath given them a law which shall

Praise the Lord upon earth: ye dragons, and all deeps;
Fire and hail, snow and vapours: wind and storm, fulfilling his word;
Mountains and all hills: fruitful trees and all cedars;
Beasts and all cattle: worms and feathered fowls;
Kings of the earth and all people: princes and all judges of the world;
Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of the Lord: for

For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: and helpeth the meek-hearted.
Let the saints be joyful with glory: let them rejoice in their beds.
Let the praises of God be in their mouth: and a two-edged sword in their hands;
To be avenged of the heathen: and to rebuke the people;
To bind their kings in chains: and their nobles with links of iron.
That they may be avenged of them, as it is written: Such honour have all his
saints.
<h3>Psalm 150</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE God in his holiness: praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him in his noble acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.

Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: praise him upon the loud cymbals.
Let every thing that hath breath: praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 151</h3>
This psalm is ascribed to David and is outside the number. When he slew Goliath in single

LITTLE was I among my brethren: a younger brother in my father’s house.
My hands, they made an instrument of music: my fingers, they prepared a
psaltery.
And who shall bring back tidings to my master? The Lord himself, himself gives
ear.
Himself sent forth his messenger: and took me from among my father’s sheep;
and with the oil of his anointing He anointed me.
Comely my brethren were and tall: and yet they found not favor with the Lord.
But I, I sallied forth to meet the alien: and he reviled me by all his idols.
But I drew forth the sword that was beside him: I cut his head off with it, and
from the sons of Israel removed reproach.</div>

O Thou Who created the deep by Thy command, Who with strength didst cover Thy chambers with waters and suspend the earth upon the waters: Thou didst hang suspended upon the Cross, yet didst shake all creation; and established the hearts of all in the fear of Thee. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye became children by fellowship, O godly martyrs of Christ, and inhabitants and inheritors of the heavenly Sion, wherein ye wear crowns, crying out with splendor: Let us sing unto the Lord, for gloriously hath He been glorified! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Cruelly maimed, ye endured the severing of your hands and feet; and though ye were cast into the fire, ye in nowise denied Christ, the God of all, but cried out fervently: Let us sing unto the Lord, for gloriously hath He been glorified! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O most beauteous Virgin Lady, beholding Him to Whom thou hast given birth willingly lifted up upon the Tree, thou didst exclaim, weeping and crying out in pain: “O compassionate God of all, as Thou art the Lord of glory, how dost Thou suffer these things, O Master?” </p><p><i class="note">Another canon, of the most holy Theotokos, in Tone II: </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i></i> He who of old gathered the waters * into one by His divine decree, * divided the sea for the people of Israel. * For He is our God and supremely glorious, * to Him alone let us sing, for He hath been glorified.

I hymn Thy might and divine sufferings, O Jesus.

O most pure Lady, have pity on me! The multitude of my transgressions and the experience of evils sorely afflict and perplex me, and drag me into the depths of despair. O most pure Lady, save me who am perishing and cruelly drowning! O good one, have mercy on my soul, which hath been brought low by wicked acts; guide me to the path of repentance, direct me in doing the will of thy Son, and deliver me from torments.

The disobedient and foolish people condemned Thee to death, Who in Thy proper and obedient character desired to be crucified, O Word, that Thou mightest give life to those deadened in spirit, and who hymn and supremely exalt Thee throughout the ages. Stretching out Thy hands upon the Cross, O Master, Thou didst heal the hands of the first-created man, which stretched out unrestrainedly to pluck the fruit of the tree; and seeing Thee, the sun hid its rays in fear and all creation trembled. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With the rays of their sacred struggles the passion-bearers dried up the streams of impiety and the outpourings of ungodliness, and poured forth springs of healings, which wash away the defilement of the passions and give drink in abundance to the hearts of the faithful. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> United in your honored sufferings and fulfilling the divine commandments, O passion-bearers, ye have become fellow citizens with the incorporeal ones, and have now been enrolled in the city on high.

O Sovereign Lady of the world, be thou my salvation!

The serpent hath filled me with his venom and hath cruelly slain my wretched soul with carnal pleasure; but restore it to life with the salve of thy prayers, O pure one. The cruel night of transgressions lay heavily upon me, O holy Lady, for I have no lamp to shed light upon my soul with the oil of good works; wherefore, I shall find myself turned away from the bridal-chamber of the Most High.

Nailed to the Cross, O Jesus Christ Who founded the whole earth upon nothing, in that Thou art good have pity and draw me forth, who by my wicked character have become stuck in the mire of sin, for by Thy shameful death Thou hast brought honor to me, O greatly Merciful One.

<h3>Psalm 119</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN I was in trouble I called upon the Lord: and he heard me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitful tongue.
What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue: even mighty
and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.
Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech: and to have my
habitation among the tents of Kedar.
My soul hath long dwelt among them: that are enemies unto peace.
I labour for peace, but when I speak unto them thereof: they make them ready to
battle.
<h3>Psalm 120</h3>
A song of ascents
I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel: shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defence upon thy right hand.
So that the sun shall not burn thee by day: neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even he that shall keep thy
soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from this time forth for
evermore.
<h3>Psalm 121</h3>
A song of ascents
I WAS glad when they said unto me: We will go into the house of the Lord.
Our feet shall stand in thy gates: O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city: that is at unity in itself.
For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord: to testify unto Israel, to
give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.
For there is the seat of judgement: even the seat of the house of David.
O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
Peace be within thy walls: and plenteousness within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions' sakes: I will wish thee prosperity.
Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God: I will seek to do thee good.
<h3>Psalm 122</h3>
A song of ascents
UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as
the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even so our eyes wait
upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are utterly despised.
Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy: and with the
despitefulness of the proud.
<h3>Psalm 123</h3>
A song of ascents
IF THE Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say: if the Lord
himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;
They had swallowed us up quick: when thy were so wrathfully displeased at us.
Yea, the waters had drowned us: and the stream had gone over our soul.
The deep waters of the proud: had gone even over our soul.
But praised be the Lord: who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.
Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler: the snare is
broken, and we are delivered .
Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.

<h3>Psalm 124</h3>
A song of ascents
THEY that put their trust in the Lord shall be even as the mount Sion: which may
not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.
The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about his
people, from this time forth for evermore.
For the rod of the ungodly cometh not into the lot of the righteous: lest the
righteous put their hand unto wickedness.
Do well, O Lord: unto those that are good and true of heart.
As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness: the Lord shall lead them
forth with the evil-doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 125</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion: then were we like unto them
that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue with joy.
Then said they among the heathen: The Lord hath done great things for them.
Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already: whereof we rejoice.
Turn our captivity, O Lord: as the rivers in the south.
They that sow in tears: shall reap in joy.
He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed: shall
doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.
<h3>Psalm 126</h3>
A song of ascents
EXCEPT the Lord build the house: their labour is but lost that build it.
Except the Lord keep the city: the watchman waketh but in vain.
It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat
the bread of carefulness: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Lo, children and the fruit of the womb: are an heritage and gift that cometh of
the Lord.
Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant: even so are the young children.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed
when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
<h3>Psalm 127</h3>
A song of ascents
BLESSED are all they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: O well is thee, and happy shalt
thou be.
Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of thine house.
Thy children like the olive-branches: round about thy table.
Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the Lord.
The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shalt see Jerusalem in
prosperity all thy life long.
Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children: and peace upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 128</h3>
A song of ascents
MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up: may Israel now
say.
Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up: but they have not
prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed upon my back: and made long furrows.
But the righteous Lord: hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.
Let them be confounded and turned backward: as many as have evil will at Sion.
Let them be even as the grass growing upon the house-tops: which withereth
afore it be plucked up;
Whereof the mower filleth not his hand: neither he that bindeth up the sheaves
his bosom.
So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord prosper you: we wish you
good luck in the Name of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 129</h3>
A song of ascents
OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.
O let thine ears consider well: the voice of my complaint.
If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss: O Lord, who may
abide it?
For there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared.
I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him: in his word is my trust.
My soul fleeth unto the Lord: before the morning watch, I say, before the
morning watch.
O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with him is
plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel: from all his sins.
<h3>Psalm 130</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, I am not high-minded: I have no proud looks.
I do not exercise myself in great matters: which are too high for me.
But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his
mother: yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.
O Israel, trust in the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 131</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, remember David: and all his trouble;
How he sware unto the Lord: and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God of Jacob;
I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house: nor climb up into my bed;
I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eye-lids to slumber: neither the
temples of my head to take any rest;
Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord: an habitation for the mighty
God of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of the same at Ephrata: and found it in the wood.
We will go into his tabernacle: and fall low on our knees before his footstool.
Arise, O Lord, into thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness: and let thy saints sing with
joyfulness.
For thy servant David's sake: turn not away the presence of thine Anointed.
The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David: and he shall not shrink from it;
Of the fruit of thy body: shall I set upon thy seat.
If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall learn them:
their children also shall sit upon thy seat for evermore.
For the Lord hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself: he hath longed for
her.
This shall be my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.
I will bless her victuals with increase: and will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will deck her priests with health: and her saints shall rejoice and sing.
There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: I have ordained a lantern for
mine Anointed.
As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame: but upon himself shall his
crown flourish.
<h3>Psalm 132</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is: brethren, to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down unto the beard:
even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts of his clothing.
Like as the dew of Hermon: which fell upon the hill of Sion.
For there the Lord promised his blessing: and life for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 133</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD now, praise the Lord: all ye servants of the Lord;
Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord: even in the courts of the house of
our God.
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary: and praise the Lord.
The Lord that made heaven and earth: give thee blessing out of Sion.

<h3>Psalm 109</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool.
The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: be thou ruler, even in the
midst among thine enemies.
In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free-will offerings with an holy
worship: the dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning.
The Lord sware, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech..
The Lord upon thy right hand: shall wound even kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places with the dead bodies:
and smite in sunder the heads over divers countries.
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up his head.
<h3>Psalm 110</h3>
Alleluia
I WILL give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart: secretly among the
faithful, and in the congregation.
The works of the Lord are great: sought out of all of them that have pleasure
therein.
His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour: and his righteousness
endureth for ever.
The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvellous works: that they
ought to be had in remembrance.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he shall ever be mindful of his
covenant.
He hath shewed his people the power of his works: that he may give them the
heritage of the heathen.
The works of his hands are verity and judgement: all his commandments are
true.
They stand fast for ever and ever: and are done in truth and equity.
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever;
holy and reverend is his Name.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all
they that do thereafter; the praise of it endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 111</h3>
Alleluia
BLESSED is the man that feareth the Lord: he hath great delight in his
commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall be
blessed.
Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth
for ever.
Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness: he is merciful, loving, and
righteous.
A good man is merciful, and lendeth: and will guide his words with discretion.
For he shall never be moved: and the righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance.
He will not be afraid of any evil tidings: for his heart standeth fast, and believeth
in the Lord.
His heart is established, and will not shrink: until he see his desire upon his
enemies.
He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor: and his righteousness
remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him: he shall gnash with his teeth,
and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.

<h3>Psalm 112</h3>

PRAISE the Lord, ye servants: O praise the Name of the Lord.
Blessed be the Name of the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
The Lord's Name is praised: from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of
the same.
The Lord is high above all heathen and his glory above the heavens.
Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling so high: and yet
humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?
He taketh up the simple out of the dust: and lifteth the poor out of the mire;
That he may set him with the princes: even with the princes of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house: and to be a joyful mother of
children.
<h3>Psalm 113</h3>
Alleluia
WHEN Israel came out of Egypt: and the house of Jacob from among the strange
people.
Judah was his sanctuary: and Israel his dominion.
The sea saw that, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams: and the little hills like young sheep.
What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest: and thou Jordan, that thou wast
driven back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams: and ye little hills, like young sheep?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the God of
Jacob.
Who turned the hard rock into a standing water: and the flint-stone into a
springing well.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise: for thy
loving mercy and for thy truth's sake.
Wherefore shall the heathen say: Where is now their God?
As for our God, he is in heaven: he hath done whatsoever pleased him.
Their idols are silver and gold: even the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not.
They have ears, and hear not: noses have they and smell not.
They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not: neither speak
they through their throat.
They that make them are like unto them ; and so are all such as put their trust in
them.
But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their succour and defence.
Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
Ye that fear the Lord, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
The Lord hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us: even he shall bless the
house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.
He shall bless them that fear the Lord: both small and great.
The Lord shall increase you more and more: you and your children.
Ye are the blessed of the Lord: who made heaven and earth.
All the whole heavens are the Lord's: the earth hath he given to the children of
men.
The dead praise not thee, O Lord: neither all they that go down into silence.
But we will praise the Lord: from this time forth for evermore. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 114</h3>
Alleluia
I AM well pleased: that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer.
That he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call upon him as long as I
live.
The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of hell gat hold
upon me.
I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I will call upon the Name of the Lord: O
Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea, our God is merciful
The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.
Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul: for the Lord hath rewarded thee.
And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from tears, and my
feet from falling.
I will walk before the Lord: in the land of the living.

<h3>Psalm 115</h3>
Alleluia
I BELIEVED, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled: I said in my
haste, All men are liars.
What reward shall I give unto the Lord: for all the benefits that he hath done
unto me?
I will receive the cup of salvation: and call upon the Name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: right dear in the sight of
the Lord is the death of his saints.
Behold, O Lord, how that I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thine
handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the Name of
the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of all his people: in the courts of
the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 116</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, all ye heathen: praise him, all ye nations.
For his merciful kindness is ever more and more towards us: and the truth of the
Lord endureth for ever. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 117</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: because his mercy endureth for
ever.
Let Israel now confess that he is gracious: and that his mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
Yea, let them now that fear the Lord confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
I called upon the Lord in trouble: and the Lord heard me at large.
The Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man doeth unto me.
The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire
upon mine enemies.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in man.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in princes.
All nations compassed me round about: but in the Name of the Lord will I destroy
them.
They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side: but in the
Name of the Lord will I destroy them.
They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire among the thorns:
for in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.
Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but the Lord was my help.
The Lord is my strength, and my song: and is become my salvation.
The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous: the right hand of
the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass.
The right hand of the Lord hath the pre-eminence: the right hand of the Lord

This is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into it.
I will thank thee, for thou hast heard me: and art become my salvation.

corner.
This is the Lord's doing: and it is marvellous in our eyes.

Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: we have wished you good
luck , ye that are of the house of the Lord.
God is the Lord who hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, yea,
even unto the horns of the altar.
Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: thou art my God, and I will praise thee.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for ever.

<h4>First Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 1</h3>
BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
stood in the way of sinners: and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful.
But his delight is in the law of the Lord: and in his law will he exercise himself
day and night.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side: that will bring forth his
fruit in due season.
His leaf also shall not wither: and look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper.
As for the ungodly, it is not so with them: but they are like the chaff, which the
wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.
Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment: neither the
sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
But the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: and the way of the ungodly shall
perish.
<h3>Psalm 2</h3>
WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why do the people imagine a
vain thing?
The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together: against the
Lord, and against his Anointed.
Let us break their bonds asunder: and cast away their cords from us.
He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: the Lord shall have them
in derision.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath: and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Yet I have set my King: upon my holy hill of Sion.
I will preach the law, whereof the Lord hath said unto me: Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee.
Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance: and the
utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron: and break them in pieces like a
potter's vessel.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be learned, ye that are judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord in fear: and rejoice unto him with reverence.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way: if his wrath
be kindled, (yea, but a little,) blessed are all they that put their trust in
him.
<h3>Psalm 3</h3>
A psalm of David. When he fled from the presence of his son Absalom
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me: many are they that rise against
me.
Many one there be that say of my soul: There is no help for him in his God.
But thou, O Lord, art my defender: thou art my worship, and the lifter up of my
head.
I did call upon the Lord with my voice: and he heard me out of his holy hill.
I laid me down and slept, and rose up again: for the Lord sustained me.
I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people: that have set themselves
against me round about.
Up, Lord, and help me, O my God: for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the
cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.
    </div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 4</h3>
For the end. A song of David among the Psalms
HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast set me at liberty
when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour: and have such
pleasure in vanity, and seek after leasing?
Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that is godly: when
I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart, and in your chamber,
and be still.
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness: and put your trust in the Lord.
There be many that say: Who will shew us any good?
Lord, lift thou up: the light of thy countenance upon us.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart: since the time that their corn and wine and
oil increased.
I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest: for it is thou, Lord, only, that
makest me dwell in safety.
<h3>Psalm 5</h3>
For the end. A song of David concerning her that inherits
PONDER my words, O Lord: consider my meditation
O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King, and my God: for unto thee
will I make my prayer.
My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O Lord: early in the morning will I direct my
prayer unto thee, and will look up.
For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness: neither shall any devil
dwell with thee.
Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest all of them that
work vanity.
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor both the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude of thy
mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies: make thy way
plain before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in his mouth: their inward parts are very wickedness.
Their throat is an open sepulchre: they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own imaginations: cast
them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebelled
against thee.
And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: they shall ever be giving of
thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be
joyful in thee;
For thou, Lord, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous: and with thy favourable
kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
<h3>Psalm 6</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns for the eighth
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy
displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones are
vexed.
My soul also is sore troubled: but, Lord, how long wilt thou punish me?
Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's sake.
For in death no man remembereth thee: and who will give thee thanks in the pit?
I am weary of my groaning; every night wash I my bed: and water my couch with
my tears.
My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of all mine enemies.
Away from me, all ye that work vanity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my
weeping.
The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer.
All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed: they shall be turned back,
and put to shame suddenly.
    </div>
      
        <div>
<h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 7</h3>
A psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the Benjamite
O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all them that
persecute me, and deliver me;
Lest he devour my soul, like a lion, and tear it in pieces: while there is none to
help.
O Lord my God, if I have done any such thing: or if there be any wickedness in
my hands;
If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me: yea, I have delivered
him that without any cause is mine enemy,
Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me: yea, let him tread my life
down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.
Stand up, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignation of
mine enemies: arise up for me in the judgement that thou hast
commanded.
And so shall the congregation of the people come about thee: for their sakes
therefore lift up thyself again.
The Lord shall judge the people; give sentence with me, O Lord: according to my
righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in me.
O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end: but guide thou the just.
For the righteous God: trieth the very hearts and reins.
My help cometh of God: who preserveth them that are true of heart.
God is a righteous Judge, strong and patient: and God is provoked every day.
If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword: he hath bent his bow, and made it
ready.
He hath prepared for him the instruments of death: he ordaineth his arrows
against the persecutors
Behold, he travaileth with mischief: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth
ungodliness.
He hath graven and digged up a pit: and is fallen on himself into the destruction
that he made for other.
For his travail shall come upon his own head: and his wickedness shall fall on his
own pate.
I will give thanks unto the Lord, according to his righteousness: and I will praise
the Name of the Lord most High.
<h3>Psalm 8</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the winepresses
O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world: thou hast set
thy glory above the heavens!
Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength,
because of thine enemies: that thou mightest still the enemy and the
avenger.
For I will consider thy heavens, even the works of thy fingers: the moon and the
stars, which thou hast ordained.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him: and the son of man, that thou visitest
him?
Thou madest him lower than the angels: to crown him with glory and worship.
Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands: and thou hast put
all things in subjection under his feet;
All sheep and oxen: yea, and the beasts of the field;
The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and whatsoever walketh through
the paths of the seas.
O Lord our Governor: how excellent is thy Name in all the world!

        <p><i class="note">Theotokion Dogmatic</i><br /> Prophet David, the ancestor of God, * spoke of thee in psalmody unto Him who hath accomplished great things in thee. * For God was well pleased without father to become a man from thee, * the Queen who standeth at His right hand, * and He - the source of life - showed thee to be His mother, * that he might renew his own image, corrupted by the passions. * Having found the lost sheep wandering on the mountain * He hath laid it upon his shoulders, * that he may bring it to his Father; * and in accordance with his own will * unite it to the heavenly Powers * and thus, O Theotokos, save the world, ** Christ, who is richly and abundantly merciful.</p>

<h3>Psalm9</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the secrets of the Son
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will speak of all thy
marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O thou
most Highest.
While mine enemies are driven back: they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in the throne that
judgest right.
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly: thou hast put out
their name for ever and ever.
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: even as the cities which
thou hast destroyed, their memorial is perished with them.
But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath also prepared his seat for judgement.
For he shall judge the world in righteousness: and minister true judgement unto
the people.
The Lord also will be a defence for the oppressed: even a refuge in due time of
trouble.
And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast
never failed them that seek thee.
O praise the Lord which dwelleth in Sion: show the people of his doings.
For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them :and forgetteth
not the complaint of the poor.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider the trouble which I suffer of them that
hate me: thou that liftest me up from the gates of death.
That I may shew all thy praises within the ports of the daughter of Sion: I will
rejoice in thy salvation.
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the same net which they
hid privily, is their foot taken.
The Lord is known to execute judgement: the ungodly is trapped in the work of
his own hands.
The wicked shall be turned into hell: and all the people that forget God.
For the poor shall not always be forgotten: the patient abiding of the meek shall
not perish for ever.
Up, Lord, and let not man have the upper hand: let the heathen be judged in thy
sight.
Put them in fear, O Lord: that the heathen may know themselves to be but men.
Why standest thou so far off, O Lord: and hidest thy face in the needful time of
trouble?
The ungodly for his own lust doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the
crafty wiliness that they have imagined.
For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire: and speaketh good of
the covetous, whom God abhorreth.
The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God ; neither is God in all his
thoughts.
His ways are always grievous: thy judgments are far above out of his sight, and
therefore defieth he all his enemies.
For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down: there shall no
harm happen unto me.
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is ungodliness
and vanity.
He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets: and privily in his lurking
dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.
For he lieth waiting secretly, even as a lion lurketh he in his den: that he may
ravish the poor.
He doth ravish the poor: when he getteth him into his net.
He falleth down, and humbleth himself: that the congregation of the poor may
fall into the hands of his captains.
He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face, and
he will never see it.
Arise, O Lord God, and lift up thine hand: forget not the poor.
Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God: while he doth say in his heart,
Tush, thou God carest not for it.
Surely thou hast seen it: for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong.
That thou mayest take the matter into thy hand: the poor committeth himself
unto thee; for thou art the helper of the friendless.
Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious: take away his ungodliness,
and thou shalt find none.
The Lord is King for ever and ever: and the heathen are perished out of the land.
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the poor: thou preparest their heart, and
thine ear hearkeneth thereto;
To help the fatherless and poor unto their right: that the man of the earth be no
more exalted against them.
<h3>Psalm10</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
IN THE Lord put I my trust: how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a
bird unto the hill?
For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the
quiver: that they may privily shoot at them which are true of heart.
For the foundations will be cast down: and what have the righteous done?
The Lord is in his holy temple: the Lord's seat is in heaven.
His eyes consider the poor: and his eye-lids try the children of men.
The Lord alloweth the righteous: but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in
wickedness, doth his soul abhor.
Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest:
this shall be their portion to drink.
For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness: his countenance will behold the
thing that is just

<h3>Psalm11</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, upon the eighth
HELP me, Lord, for there is not one godly man left: for the faithful are minished
from among the children of men,
They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour: they do but flatter with their
lips, and dissemble in their double heart.
The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips: and the tongue that speaketh proud
things;
Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail: we are they that ought to
speak , who is lord over us?
Now for the comfortless trouble's sake of the needy: and because of the deep
sighing of the poor,
I will up, saith the Lord: and will help every one from him that swelleth against
him, and will set him at rest.
The words of the Lord are pure words: even as the silver, which from the earth is
tried, and purified seven times in the fire.
Thou shalt keep them, O Lord: thou shalt preserve him from this generation for
ever.
The ungodly walk on every side: when they are exalted, the children of men are
put to rebuke.
<h3>Psalm12</h3>
For the end, psalm of David
HOW long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever: how long wilt thou hide thy face
from me?
How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart: how long
shall mine enemies triumph over me?
Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in
death.
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: for if I be cast down, they
that trouble me will rejoice at it.
But my trust is in thy mercy: and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.
I will sing of the Lord, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me: yea, I will
praise the Name of the Lord most Highest.
<h3>Psalm13</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE fool hath said in his heart: There is no God.
They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings: there is none that
doeth good, no not one.
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there
were any that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is none that doeth good, no not one.
Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have they deceived: the
poison of asps is under their lips.
Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood.
Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they not
known ; there is no fear of God before their eyes.
Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief: eating up my
people as it were bread, and call not upon the Lord?
There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was: for God is in the
generation of the righteous.
As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor: because he putteth
his trust in the Lord.
Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turneth the
captivity of his people: then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

<h3>Psalm14</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle: or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?
Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life: and doeth the thing which is right, and
speaketh the truth from his heart.
He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour: and
hath not slandered his neighbour.
He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes: and maketh much of
them that fear the Lord.
He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not: thou it were to
his own hindrance.
He that hath not given his money upon usury: nor taken reward against the
innocent.
Whoso doeth these things: shall never fall.
<h3>Psalm15</h3>
A writing of David
PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee have I put my trust.
O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, my goods are nothing
unto thee.
All my delight is upon the saints, that are in the earth: and upon such as excel in
virtue.
But they that run after another god: shall have great trouble.
Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer: neither make mention of their
names within my lips.
The Lord himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou shalt
maintain my lot.
The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will thank the Lord for giving me warning: my reins also chasten me in the
night-season.
I have set God always before me: for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not
fall.
Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiced: my flesh also shall rest in
hope.
For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell: neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy
One to see corruption.
Thou shalt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is the fulness of joy: and at
thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.
<h3>Psalm16</h3>
A prayer of David
HEAR the right, O Lord, consider my complaint: and hearken unto my prayer,
that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence: and let thine eyes look upon the
thing that is equal.
Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night-season; thou hast tried me,
and shalt find no wickedness in me; for I am utterly purposed that my
mouth shall not offend.
Because of men's works, that are done against the words of thy lips: I have kept
me from the ways of the destroyer.
O hold thou up my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps slip not.
I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: incline thine ear to me,
and hearken unto my words.
Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which
put their trust in thee: from such as resist thy right hand.
Keep me as the apple of an eye: hide me under the shadow of thy wings.
From the ungodly that trouble me: mine enemies compass me round about to
take away my soul.
They are enclosed in their own fat: and their mouth speaketh proud things.
They lie waiting in our way on every side: turning their eyes down to the ground.
Like of a lion that is greedy of his prey: and as it were a lion's whelp. lurking in
secret places.
Up, Lord, disappoint him, and cast him down: deliver my soul from the ungodly,
which is a sword of thine;
From the men of thy hand, O Lord, from the men, I say, and from the evil world:
which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid
treasure.
They have children at their desire: and leave the rest of their substance for their
babes.
But as for me, I will behold thy presence in righteousness: and when I awake up
after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied with it.</div>

<h3>Psalm 17</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David the servant of the Lord. The words which he spoke to the Lord,
even the words of this song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his
enemies, and out of the hand of Saul. And he said:
I WILL love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony rock, and my
defence: my saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust, my
buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.
I will call upon the Lord, which is worthy to be praised: so shall I be safe from
mine enemies.
The sorrows of death compassed me: and the overflowings of ungodliness made
me afraid.
The pains of hell came about me: the snares of death overtook me.
In my trouble I will call upon the Lord: and complain unto my God.
So shall he hear my voice out of his holy temple: and my complaint shall come
before him, it shall enter even into his ears.
The earth trembled and quaked: the very foundations also of the hills shook, and
were removed, because he was wroth.
There went a smoke out in his presence: and a consuming fire out of his mouth,
so that coals were kindled at it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and it was dark under his feet.
He rode upon the cherubim, and did fly: he came flying upon the wings of the
wind.
He made darkness his secret place: his pavilion round about him, with dark
water and thick clouds to cover him.
At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed: hail-stones and coals of
fire.
The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hailstones and coals of fire.
He sent out his arrows, and scattered them: he cast forth lightnings, and
destroyed them.
The springs of water were seen, and the foundations of the round world were
discovered, at thy chiding, O Lord: at the blasting of the breath of thy
displeasure.
He shall send down from on high to fetch me: and shall take me out of many
waters.
He shall deliver from me my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me: for
they are too mighty for me.
They prevented me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my upholder.
He brought me forth also into a place of liberty: he brought me forth even
because he had a favour unto me.
The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing: according to the cleanness
of my hands shall he recompense me.
Because I have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not forsaken my God, as the
wicked doth.
For I have an eye unto all his laws: and will not cast out his commandments from
me.
I was also uncorrupt before him: and eschewed mine own wickedness.
Therefore shall the Lord reward me after my righteous dealing: and according
unto the cleanness of my hands in his eye-sight.
With the holy thou shalt be holy: and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.
With the clean thou shalt be clean: and with the froward thou shalt learn
frowardness.
For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity: and shalt bring down the
high looks of the proud.
Thou also shalt light my candle: the Lord my God shall make my darkness to be
light.
For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men: and with the help of my God I shall
leap over the wall.
The way of God is an undefiled way: the word of the Lord also is tried in the fire;
he is the defender of all them that put their trust in him.
For who is God, but the Lord: or who hath any strength, except our God?
It is God, that girdeth me with strength of war: and maketh my way perfect.
He maketh my feet like harts' feet: and setteth me up on high.
He teacheth mine hands to fight: and mine arms shall break even a bow of steel.
Thou hast given me the defence of my salvation: thy right hand also shall hold
me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.
Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go: that my footsteps shall not
slide.
I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them: neither will I turn again till I
have destroyed them.
I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand: but fall under my feet.
Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou shalt throw done mine
enemies under me.
Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me: and I shall
destroy them that hate me.
They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them: yea, even unto the Lord
shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.
I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I will cast them out as the
clay in the streets.
Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people: and thou shalt make me
the head of the heathen.
A people whom I have not known: shall serve me.
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: but the strange children shall
dissemble with me.
The strange children shall fail: and be afraid out of their prisons.
The Lord liveth, and blessed be my strong helper: and praised be the Lord of my
salvation.
Even the God that seeth that I be avenged: and subdueth the people unto me.
It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine
adversaries: thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.
For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles: and sing
praises unto thy Name.
Great prosperity giveth he unto his King: and showeth loving-kindness unto
David his Anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.

<h3>Psalm 18</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament showeth his
handiwork.
One day telleth another: and one night certifieth another.
There is neither speech nor language: but their voices are heard among them.
Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words into the ends of the world.
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun: which cometh forth as a
bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.
It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the
end of it again: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, converting the soul: the testimony of the
Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: the commandment of
the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever: the judgments of the Lord
are true, and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also
than honey, and the honey-comb.
Moreover, by them is thy servant taught: and in keeping of them there is great
reward.
Who can tell how oft he offendeth: O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.
Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion over
me: so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart: be alway
acceptable in thy sight,
O Lord: my strength, and my redeemer.
<h3>Psalm 19</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the Name of the God of Jacob defend
thee;
Send thee help from the sanctuary: and strengthen thee out of Sion;
Remember all thy offerings: and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
Grant thee thy heart's desire: and fulfil all thy mind.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God:
the Lord perform all thy petitions.
Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Anointed, and will hear him from his holy
heaven: even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.
Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the
Name of the Lord our God.
They are brought down, and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, Lord and hear us, O King of heaven: when we call upon thee.
<h3>Psalm 20</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be of thy
salvation.
Thou hast given him his heart's desire: and hast not denied him the request of
his lips.
For thou shalt prevent him with the blessings of goodness: and shalt set a crown
of pure gold upon his head.
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life: even for ever and ever.
His honour is great in thy salvation: glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon
him.
For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity: and make him glad with the joy of thy
countenance.
And why? because the King putteth his trust in the Lord: and in the mercy of the
most Highest he shall not miscarry.
All thine enemies shall feel thine hand: thy right hand shall find out them that
hate thee.
Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: the Lord shall
destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.
Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth: and their seed from among the
children of men.
For they intended mischief against thee: and imagined such a device as they are
not able to perform.
Therefore shalt thou put them to flight: and the strings of thy bow shalt thou
make ready against the face of them.
Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so we will sing, and praise thy
power.

<h3>Psalm 21</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the morning aid.
MY GOD, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me: and art so far from
my health, and from the words of my complaint?
O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not: and in the night-season
also I take no rest.
And thou continuest holy: O thou worship of Israel.
Our fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them.
They called upon thee, and were holpen: they put their trust in thee, and were
not confounded.
But as for me, I am a worm, and no man: a very scorn of men, and the outcast of
the people.
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot our their lips, and shake their
heads, saying,
He trusted in God, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, if he will have
him.
But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: thou wast my hope, when
I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.
I have been left unto thee ever since I was born: thou art my God, even from my
mother's womb.
O go not from me, for trouble is hard at hand: and there is none to help me.
Many oxen are come about me: fat bulls of Basan close me in on every side.
They gape upon me with their mouths: as it were a ramping and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart also in the
midst of my body is even like melting wax.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my gums: and
thou shalt bring me into the dust of death.
For many dogs are come about me: and the council of the wicked layeth siege
against me.
They pierced my hands and my feet; I may tell all my bones: they stand staring
and looking upon me.
They part my garments among them: and casts lots upon my vesture.
But be not thou far from me, O Lord: thou art my succour, haste thee to help me.
Deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth: thou hast heard me also from among the horns of
the unicorns.
I will declare thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I
praise thee.
O praise the Lord, ye that fear him: magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob, and
fear him, all ye seed of Israel.
For he hath not despised, nor abhorred, the low estate of the poor: he hath not
hid his face from him, but when he called unto him he heard him.
My praise is of thee in the great congregation: my vows will I perform in the
sight of them that fear him.
The poor shall eat and be satisfied: they that seek after the Lord shall praise him;
your heart shall live for ever.
All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned unto the
Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him.
For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the Governor among the people.
All such as be fat upon earth: have eaten and worshipped.
All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him: and no man hath
quickened his own soul.
My seed shall serve him: they shall be counted unto the Lord for a generation.
They shall come, and the heavens shall declare his righteousness: unto a people
that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.
<h3>Psalm 22</h3>
A psalm of David
THE Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside the waters of
comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness, for
his Name's sake.
Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort me.
Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble me: thou hast
anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.
But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
<h3>Psalm 23</h3>
A psalm of David on the first day of the week
THE earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and
they that dwell therein.
For he hath founded it upon the seas: and prepared it upon the floods.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall rise up in his holy place?
Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart: and that hath not lift up his
mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord: and righteousness from the God of
his salvation.
This is the generation of them that seek him: even of them that seek thy face, O
Jacob.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: it is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty
in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: even the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.

        <h4>From the Octoechos</h4>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i>Thou wast lifted upon the Cross, O Lord, and Thou hast abolished the power of death, and as God Thou hast expunged the record held against us. O only Lover of mankind, grant the Thief’s repentance to us also, who serve Thee with faith, O Christ our God, and cry unto Thee, ‘Remember us also in Thy kingdom’.</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i>On the Cross Thou didst tear up our record with the lance, and numbered among the dead Thou didst bind the tyrant there, thus delivering all from the bonds of Hades by Thy Resurrection; through which, O Lord who lovest mankind, we have been enlightened and we cry unto Thee, ‘Remember us also in Thy kingdom’.</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i>Thou wast crucified and arose from the tomb on the third day as conqueror, and Thou hast raised Adam the first-formed again, O only Immortal, grant me also, O Lord, to turn again to repentance from my whole heart, and ever cry unto Thee with fervent faith, ‘Remember me, O Savior, in Thy kingdom’.</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i>For our sakes the impassible became a man, subject to suffering, and willingly nailed on the Cross He hath raised us with himself; therefore with the Cross we also glorify the Passion and Resurrection, through which we have been refashioned, and through which we are saved, as we cry, ‘Remember us also in Thy kingdom’.</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i>Let us the faithful implore him who rose from the dead, despoiled the might of Hades, and appeared to the women as He cried 'Rejoice!'; free our souls from corruption, as we ever cry unto him in the words of the good Thief, ‘Remember us also in Thy kingdom’.</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i>Let us the faithful with one mind vow to glorify the Father and the Son and the Most holy Spirit, Unity of Godhead in three Hypostases, remaining unconfused, simple, undivided and unapproachable, through which we are delivered from the fire of eternal punishment.</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Christ, most merciful Master, we bring to Thee Thy Mother, who bore Thee in the flesh without seed and truly remained a Virgin incorrupt after child-birth, to intercede: ever grant pardon offences to those who cry unto Thee: Remember us also in Thy kingdom.</p>

<h3>Psalm 24</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my trust in thee: O
let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.
For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed: but such as transgress
without a cause shall be put to confusion.
Shew me thy ways, O Lord: and teach me thy paths.
Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God of my salvation; in
thee hath been my hope all the day long.
Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender mercies: and thy loving-kindnesses,
which have been ever of old.
O remember not the sins and offences of my youth: but according to thy mercy
think thou upon me, O Lord, for thy goodness.
Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Them that are meek shall he guide in judgement: and such as are gentle, them
shall he learn his way.
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth: unto such as keep his covenant
and his testimonies.
For thy Name's sake, O Lord: be merciful unto my sin, for it is great.
What man is he that feareth the Lord: him shall he teach in the way that he shall
choose.
His soul shall dwell at ease: and his seed shall inherit the land.
The secret of the Lord is among them that fear him: and he will show them his
covenant.
Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out of the
net.
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am desolate and in misery.
The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my troubles.
Look upon my adversity and misery: and forgive me all my sin.
Consider mine enemies, how many they are: and they bear a tyrannous hate
against me.
O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be confounded, for I have put my
trust in thee.
Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me: for my hope hath been in
thee.
Deliver Israel, O God: out of all his troubles.
<h3>Psalm 25</h3>
A psalm of David
BE THOU my judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently: my trust hath been
also in the Lord, therefore shall I not fall.
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me: try out my reins and my heart.
For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes: and I will walk in thy truth.
I have not dwelt with vain persons: neither will I have fellowship with the
deceitful.
I have hated the congregation of the wicked: and will not sit among the ungodly.
I will wash my hands in innocency, O Lord: and so will I go to thine altar.
That I may show the voice of thanksgiving: and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house: and the place where thine honour
dwelleth.
O shut not up my soul with the sinners: nor my life with the blood-thirsty.
In whose hands is wickedness: and their right hand is full of gifts.
But as for me, I will walk innocently: O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.
My foot standeth right: I will praise the Lord in the congregations.
<h3>Psalm 26</h3>
A psalm of David before he was anointed
THE Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom then shall I fear: the Lord is the
strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my
flesh: they stumbled and fell.
Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid:
and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.
One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may dwell
in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of
the Lord, and to visit his temple.
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle: yea, in the secret
place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone.
And now shall he lift up mine head: above mine enemies round about me.
Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness: I will sing,
and speak praises unto the Lord.
Hearken unto my voice, O Lord, when I cry unto thee: have mercy upon me, and
hear me.
My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: Thy face, Lord, will I seek.
O hide not thou thy face from me: nor cast thy servant away in displeasure.
Thou hast been my succour: leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me: the Lord taketh me up.
Teach me the way, O Lord: and lead in the right way, because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: for there are false
witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.
I should utterly have fainted: but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the
Lord in the land of the living.
O tarry thou the Lord's leisure: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart ; and
put thou thy trust in the Lord.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 27</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee will I cry, O Lord my strength: think no scorn of me; lest, if thou
make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go down into the
pit.
Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee: when I hold up my
hands towards the mercy-seat of thy holy temple.
O pluck me not away, neither destroy me, with the ungodly and wicked doers:
which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mischief in their
hearts.
Reward them according to their deeds: and according to the wickedness of their
own inventions.
Recompense them after the work of their hands: pay them that they have
deserved.
For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his
hands: therefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.
Praised be the Lord: for he hath heard the voice of my humble petitions.
The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and I am
helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise
him.
The Lord is my strength: and he is the wholesome defence of his Anointed.
O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: feed them , and
set them up for ever.
<h3>Psalm 28</h3>
A psalm of David on the occasion of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle
BRING unto the Lord, O ye mighty, bring young rams unto the Lord: ascribe unto
the Lord worship and strength.
Give the Lord the honour due unto his Name: worship the Lord with holy
worship.
It is the Lord that commandeth the waters: it is the glorious God that maketh the
thunder.
It is the Lord that ruleth the sea; the voice of the Lord is mighty in operation: the
voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar-trees: yea, the Lord breaketh the
cedars of Libanus.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf: Libanus also, and Sirion, like a young
unicorn.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the Lord shaketh
the wilderness: yea, the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Cades.
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and discovereth the
thick bushes: in his temple doth every man speak of his honour.
The Lord sitteth above the water -flood: and the Lord remaineth a King for ever.
The Lord shall give strength unto his people: the Lord shall give his people the
blessing of peace.
<h3>Psalm 29</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song at the dedication of the house of David
I WILL magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up: and not made my foes to
triumph over me.
O Lord my God, I cried unto thee: and thou hast healed me.
Thou, Lord, hast brought my soul out of hell: thou hast kept my life from them
that go down to the pit.
Sing praises unto the Lord, O ye saints of his: and give thanks unto him for a
remembrance of his holiness.
For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his pleasure is life:
heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: thou, Lord, of thy
goodness hast made my hill so strong.
Thou didst turn thy face from me: and I was troubled.
Then cried I unto thee, O Lord: and gat me to my Lord right humbly.
What profit is there in my blood: when I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust give thanks unto thee: or shall it declare thy truth?
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.
Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and
girded me with gladness.
Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing: O my God, I
will give thanks unto thee for ever.

<h3>Psalm 30</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David; an utterance of extreme fear
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion, deliver
me in thy righteousness.
Bow down thine ear to me: make haste to deliver me.
And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence: that thou mayest save me.
For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: be thou also my guide, and lead me
for thy Name's sake.
Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my
strength.
Into thy hands I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou
God of truth.
I have hated them that hold of superstitious vanities: and my trust hath been in
the Lord.
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble, and
hast known my soul in adversities.
Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: but hast set my feet in a
large room.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord , for I am in trouble: and mine eye is consumed for
very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.
For my life is waxen old with heaviness: and my years with mourning.
My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity: and my bones are consumed.
I became a reproof among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours: and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me; and they
that did see me without conveyed themselves from me.
I am clean forgotten, as a dead man out of mind: I am become like a broken
vessel.
For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude: and fear is on every side, while
they conspire together against me, and take their counsel to take away my
life.
But my hope hath been in thee, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my God.
My time is in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies: and from
them that persecute me.
Shew thy servant the light of thy countenance: and save me for thy mercy's sake.
Let me not be confounded, O Lord for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be
put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.
Let the lying lips be put to silence: which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully,
speak against the righteous.
O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee:
and that thou hast prepared for them that put their trust in thee, even
before the sons of men!
Thou shalt hide them privily by thine own presence from the provoking of all
men: thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle from the strife of
tongues.
Thanks be to the Lord: for he hath shewed me marvellous great kindness in a
strong city.
And when I made haste, I said: I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.
Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer: when I cried unto thee.
26.O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth them that are
faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.
Be strong, and he shall establish your heart: all that ye put your trust in the
Lord.
<h3>Psalm 31</h3>
A psalm of instruction by David
BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven: and whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no sin: and in whose spirit
there is no guile.
For while I held my tongue: my bones consumed away through my daily
complaining.
For thy hand is heavy upon me day and night: and my moisture is like the
drought in summer.
I will acknowledge my sin unto thee: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.
I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord: and so thou forgavest the wickedness
of my sin.
For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a time when
thou mayest be found: but in the great water-floods they shall not come
nigh him.
Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shalt preserve me from trouble: thou shalt
compass me about with songs of deliverance.
I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go: and I will
guide thee with mine eyes.
Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding: whose mouths
must be held with bit and bridle. lest they fall upon thee.
Great plagues remain for the ungodly: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord,
mercy embraceth him on every side.
Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord: and be joyful, all ye that are true
of heart.

<h3>Psalm 32</h3>
A psalm of David
REJOICE in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to be thankful.
Praise the Lord with harp: sing praises unto him with the lute, and instrument of
ten strings.
Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing praises lustily unto him with a good
courage.
For the word of the Lord is true: and all his works are faithful.
He loveth righteousness and judgement: the earth is full of the goodness of the
Lord.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the hosts of them by the
breath of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap: and layeth
up the deep, as in a treasure-house.
Let all the earth fear the Lord: stand in awe of him, all ye that dwell in the world.
For he spake, and it was done: he commanded and it stood fast.
The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: and maketh the devices
of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the counsels of princes.
The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever: and the thoughts of his heart from
generation to generation.
Blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord Jehovah: and blessed are the folk,
that he hath chosen to him to be his inheritance.
The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the children of men: from the
habitation of his dwelling he considereth all them that dwell on the earth.
He fashioneth all the hearts of them: and understandeth all their works.
There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host: neither is any
mighty man delivered by much strength.
A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man: neither shall he deliver any
man by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him: and upon them that put
their trust in his mercy.
To deliver their soul from death: and to feed them in the time of dearth.
Our soul hath patiently tarried for the Lord: for he is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in him: because we have hoped in his holy Name.
Let thy merciful kindness, O Lord, be upon us: like as we do put our trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 33</h3>
A psalm of David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech, and he was dismissed
and departed
I WILL alway give thanks unto the Lord: his praise shall ever be in my mouth.
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be
glad.
O praise the Lord with me: and let us magnify his Name together.
I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he delivered me out of all my fear.
They had an eye unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
ashamed.
Lo, the poor crieth, and the Lord heareth him: yea, and saveth him out of all his
troubles.
The angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him: and delivereth
them.
O taste, and see, how gracious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusteth in
him.
O fear the Lord, ye that are his saints: for they that fear him lack nothing.
The lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they who seek the Lord shall want no
manner of thing that is good.
Come, ye children, and hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
What man is he that lusteth to live: and would fain see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil: and thy lips, that they speak no guile.
Eschew evil, and do good: seek peace, and ensue it.
The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous: and his ears are open unto their
prayers.
The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil: to root out the
remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them: and delivereth them out of all
their troubles.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and will save such as be
of an humble spirit.
Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of all.
He keepeth all his bones: so that not one of them is broken.
But misfortune shall slay the ungodly: and they that hate the righteous shall be
desolate.
The Lord delivereth the souls of his servants: and all they that put their trust in
him shall not be destitute.

<h3>Psalm 34</h3>
A psalm of David
PLEAD thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: and fight thou
against them that fight against me.
Lay hand upon the shield and buckler: and stand up to help me.
Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto
my soul, I am thy salvation.
Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seek after my soul :let them be
turned back and brought to confusion, that imagine mischief for me.
Let them be as the dust before the wind: and the angel of the Lord scattering
them.
Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord persecute them.
For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause: yea, even
without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.
Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net, that he hath laid
privily, catch himself: that he may fall into his own mischief.
And, my soul, be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, who deliverest the poor from
him that is too strong for him: yea, the poor, and him that is in misery, from
him that spoileth him?
False witnesses did rise up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
They rewarded me evil for good: to the great discomfort of my soul.
Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with
fasting.: and my prayer shall turn into mine own bosom.
I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother: I went heavily,
as one that mourneth for his mother.
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the
very abjects came together against me unawares, making mouths at me,
and ceased not.
With the flatterers were busy mockers: who gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, how long wilt though look upon this: O deliver my soul from the calamities
which they bring on me, and my darling from the lions.
So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among
much people.
O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly: neither let them
wink with their eyes that they hate me without a cause.
And why? their communing is not for peace; but they imagine deceitful words
against them that are quiet in the land.
They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said: Fie on thee, fie on thee, we
saw it with our eyes.
This thou hast seen, O Lord: hold not thy tongue then, go not far from me, O
Lord.
Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel: avenge thou my cause, my God, and
my Lord.
Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness: and let them not
triumph over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, There, there, so would we have it: neither let
them say, We have devoured him.
Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at my trouble: let
them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that boast themselves against
me.
Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing: yea, let them say
alway, Blessed be the Lord, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
servant.
And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness: and of thy praise
all the day long.
<h3>Psalm 35</h3>
For the end. By David the servant of the Lord
MY HEART sheweth me the wickedness of the ungodly: that there is no fear of
God before his eyes.
For he flattereth himself in his own sight: until his abominable sin be found out.
The words of his mouth are unrighteous, and full of deceit: he hath left off to
behave himself wisely, and to do good.
He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good way:
neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.
Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth unto the heavens: and thy faithfulness unto the
clouds.
Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: thy judgments are like the
great deep.
Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast; How excellent is thy mercy, O God:
and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy
wings.
They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house: and thou shalt give
them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.
For with thee is the well of life: and in thy light shall we see light.
O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee: and thy
righteousness unto them that are true of heart.
O let not the foot of pride come against me: and let not the hand of the ungodly
cast me down.
There are they fallen, all that work wickedness: they are cast down, and shall not
be able to stand.

<h3>Psalm 36</h3>
A psalm of David
FRET not thyself because of the ungodly: neither be thou envious against the
evil-doers.
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass: and be withered even as the
green herb.
Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good: dwell in the land, and verily
thou shalt be fed.
Delight thou in the Lord: and he shall give thee thy heart's desire.
Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him: and he shall bring it to
pass.
He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light ; and thy just dealing as the
noon-day.
Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon him: but grieve not thyself at
him whose way doth prosper, against the man that doeth after evil
counsels.
Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: fret not thyself, else shalt thou be
moved to do evil.
Wicked doers shall be rooted out: and they that patiently abide the Lord, those
shall inherit the land.
Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: thou shalt look after his
place, and he shall be away.
But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth: and shall be refreshed in the
multitude of peace.
The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just: and gnasheth upon him with his
teeth.
The Lord shall laugh him to scorn: for he hath seen that his day is coming.
The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow: to cast down
the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of a right conversation.
Their sword shall go through their own heart: and their bow shall be broken.
A small thing that the righteous hath: is better than great riches of the ungodly.
For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken: and the Lord upholdeth the
righteous.
The Lord knoweth the days of the godly: and their inheritance shall endure for
ever.
They shall not be confounded in the perilous time: and in the days of dearth they
shall have enough.
As for the ungodly, they shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord shall consume
as the fat of lambs: yea, even as the smoke shall they consume away.
The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous is merciful and
liberal.
Such as are blessed of God shall possess the land: and they that are cursed of
him shall be rooted out.
The Lord ordereth a good man's going: and maketh his way acceptable to
himself.
Though he fall, he shall not be cast away: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
hand.
I have been young, and now am old: and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging their bread.
The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth: and his seed is blessed.
Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good: and dwell for evermore.
For the Lord loveth the thing that is right: he forsaketh not his that be godly, but
they are preserved for ever.
The unrighteous shall be punished: as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be
rooted out.
The righteous shall inherit the land: and dwell therein forever.
The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and his tongue will be talking
of judgement.
The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not slide.
The ungodly seeth the righteous: and seeketh occasion to slay him.
The Lord will not leave him in his hand: nor condemn him when he is judged.
Hope thou in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee, that thou
shalt possess the land: when the ungodly shall perish, thou shalt see it.
I myself have seen the ungodly in great power: and flourishing like a green baytree.
I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him, but his place could no where be
found.
Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right: for that shall bring a
man peace at the last.
As for the transgressors, they shall perish together: and the end of the ungodly
is, they shall be rooted out at the last.
But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord: who is also their strength
in the time of trouble.
And the Lord shall stand by them, and save them: he shall deliver them from the
ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him.

Thy ministering radiances were deemed worthy to gaze upon the comely beauty of Thy countenance; and, having thereby received understanding, they cry out to Thee: Glory to Thy power, O Christ! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The Virgin Queen now standeth, arrayed in golden vesture, before the King her Son, incomparably more exalted than the angels, who cry out: Glory to Thy power, O Christ! </p><h3>Ode V</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Now I shall arise said God prophetically, * now I shall be glorified, now I shall be exalted, * elevating fallen human nature, * which I received from the Virgin, * to the noetic light of My divinity.

<h3>Psalm 37</h3>
A psalm of David . For remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day
PUT me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy heavy
displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me: and thy hand presseth me sore.
There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure: neither is there any
rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.
For my wickednesses are gone over my head: and are like a sore burden, too
heavy for me to bear.
My wounds stink, and are corrupt: through my foolishness.
I am brought into so great trouble and misery: that I go mourning all the day
long.
For my loins are filled with a sore disease: and there is no whole part in my body.
I am feeble, and sore smitten: I have roared for the very disquietness of my
heart.
Lord, thou knowest all my desire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me: and the sight of mine eyes is gone
from me.
My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble: and my
kinsmen stood afar off.
They also that sought after my life laid snares for me: and they that went about
to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit all the day long.
As for me I was like a deaf men, and heard not: and as one that is dumb, who
doth not open his mouth.
I became even as a man that heareth not: and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my
God.
I have required that they, even mine enemies should not triumph over me: for
when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me.
And I, truly, am set in the plague: and my heaviness is ever in my sight.
For I will confess my wickedness: and be sorry for my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are mighty: and they that hate me wrongfully are
many in number.
They also that reward evil for good are against me: because I follow the thing
that good is.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me.
Haste thee to help me: O Lord God of my salvation.
<h3>Psalm 38</h3>
For the end. A song of David, for Idithun
I SAID, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not in my tongue.
I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle: while the ungodly is in my sight.
I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even from good words;
but it was pain and grief to me.
My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire kindled: and at
the last I spake with my tongue;
Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may be certified
how long I have to live.
Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long: and mine age is even as
nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is altogether vanity.
For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth
up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.
And now, Lord, what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.
Deliver me from all mine offences: and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.
I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.
Take thy plague away from me: I am even consumed by the means of thy heavy
hand.
When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to
consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man
therefore is but vanity.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling: hold not thy
peace at my tears.
For I am a stranger with thee: and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence, and be no
more seen
<h3>Psalm 39</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
I WAITED patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and heard my calling.
He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay: and set my
feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth: even a thanksgiving unto our God.
Many shall see it, and fear: and shall put their trust in the Lord.
Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the Lord: and turned not unto the
proud, and to such as go about with lies.
O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like as be
also thy thoughts which are to us-ward: and yet there is no man that
ordereth them unto thee:
If I should declare them, and speak of them: they should be more than I am able
to express.
Sacrifice and meat-offering thou wouldest not: but mine ears hast thou opened.
Burnt-offerings, and sacrifice for sin, hast thou not required: then said I, Lo, I
come,
In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil thy will, O my
God: I am content to do it; yea, thy law is within my heart.
I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I will not refrain
my lips, O Lord, and that thou knowest.
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart: my talk hath been of thy truth
and of thy salvation.
I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth: from the great congregation.
Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord: let thy loving-kindness and thy
truth alway preserve me.
For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such hold upon
me that I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the
hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.
O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me: make haste, O Lord, to help me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after my soul to
destroy it: let them be driven backward and put to rebuke, that wish me
evil.
Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame: that say unto me, Fie upon
thee, fie upon thee.
Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let such as love thy
salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and needy: but the Lord careth for me.
Thou art my helper and redeemer: make no long tarrying, O my God.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 40</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him
in the time of trouble.
The Lord preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth:
and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.
The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick upon his bed: make thou all his bed in
his sickness.
I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies speak evil of me: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: and his heart conceiveth falsehood
within himself, and when he cometh forth he telleth it.
All mine enemies whisper together against me: even against me do they imagine
this evil.
Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him: and now that he lieth, let him
rise up no more.
Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted: who did also eat of my
bread, hath laid great wait for me.
But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord: raise thou me up again, and I shall reward
them.
By this I know thou favourest me: that mine enemy doth not triumph against me.
And when I am in my health, thou upholdest me: and shalt set me before thy face
for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: world without end. Amen.
<h3>Psalm 41</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: when shall I come to
appear before the presence of God?
My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where
is now thy God?
Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the
multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;
In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day.
Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted
within me?
Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his
countenance.
My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore will I remember thee concerning
the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermon.
One deep calleth another, because of the noise of the water-pipes: all thy waves
and storms are gone over me.
The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time: and in the nightseason did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me: why go I
thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword: while mine enemies that trouble
me cast me in the teeth;
Namely, while they say daily unto me: Where is now thy God?
Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.
<h3>Psalm 42</h3>
A psalm of David
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people:
O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.
For thou art the God of my strength, why hast thou put me from thee: and why
go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me: and bring me unto thy
holy hill, and to thy dwelling.
And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and
gladness: and upon the harp I will give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.

<h3>Psalm 43</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
WE HAVE heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us: what thou hast
done in their time of old;
How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted them in: how
thou hast destroyed the nations and cast them out.
For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword: neither was it
their own arm that helped them;
But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance: because
thou hadst a favour unto them.
Thou art my King, O God: send help unto Jacob.
Through thee will we overthrow our enemies: and in thy Name will we tread
them under, that rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow: it is not my sword that shall help me;
But it is thou that savest us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion that
hate us.
We make our boast of God all day long: and will praise thy Name for ever.
But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion: and goest not forth with our
armies.
Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies: so that they which hate us
spoil our goods.
Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep: and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Thou sellest thy people for nought: and takest no money for them.
Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours: to be laughed to scorn, and had
in derision of them that are round about us.
Thou makest us to be a by-word among the heathen: and that the people shake
their heads at us.
My confusion is daily before me: and the shame of my face hath covered me;
For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer: for the enemy and avenger.
And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee: nor behave
ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.
Our heart is not turned back: neither our steps gone out of thy way;
No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons: and covered us with
the shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to any
strange God: shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very secrets of
the heart.
For thy sake also are we killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep
appointed to be slain.
Up, Lord, why sleepest thou: awake, and be not absent from us for ever.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face: and forgettest our misery and trouble?
For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
ground.
Arise, and help us: and deliver us for thy mercy's sake.
<h3>Psalm 44</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses by the sons of Core, for instruction. A Song concerning the
beloved
MY HEART is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the thing which I have made
unto the King.
My tongue is the pen: of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, because God
hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most Mighty: according to thy
worship and renown.
Good luck have thou with thine honour: ride on, because of the word of truth , of
meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible
things.
Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be subdued unto thee: even in
the midst among the King's enemies.
Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, even thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia: out of the ivory palaces,
whereby they have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did
stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, incline thine ear ; forget also thine own
people, and thy father's house.
So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty: for his is thy Lord God, and
worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: like as the rich also among
the people shall make their supplication before thee.
The King's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work: the virgins that be
her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee.
With joy and gladness shall they be brought: and shall enter into the King's
palace.
Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children: whom thou mayest make princes
in all lands.
I will remember thy Name from one generation to another: therefore shall the
people give thanks unto thee, world without end.
<h3>Psalm 45</h3>
For the end. For the sons of Core; a psalm concerning secret things
GOD is our hope and strength: a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved: and though the hills be
carried into the midst of the sea;
Though the waters thereof rage and swell: and though the mountains shake at
the tempest of the same.
The rivers of the flood thereof shall make glad the city of God: the holy place of
the tabernacle of the most Highest.
God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed: God shall help
her, and that right early.
The heathen make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved: but God hath shewed
his voice, and the earth shall melt away.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.
O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord: what destruction he hath
brought upon the earth.
He maketh wars to cease in all the world: he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the
spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.
Be still then, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I
will be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

<h3>Psalm 46</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O CLAP your hand together, all ye people: O sing unto God with the voice of
melody.
For the Lord is high, and to be feared: he is the great King upon all the earth.
He shall subdue the people under us: and the nations under our feet.
He shall choose out an heritage for us: even the worship of Jacob, whom he
loved.
God is gone up with a merry noise: and the Lord with the sound of the trump.
O sing praises, sing praises unto our God: O sing praises, sing praises unto our
King.
For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon his holy seat.
The princes of the people are joined unto the people of the God of Abraham: for
God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the earth, as it were with a
shield.
<h3>Psalm 47</h3>
A psalm of praise for the sons of Core on the second day of the week
GREAT is the Lord, and highly to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his
holy hill.
The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth: upon the north-side
lieth the city of the great King; God is well known in her palaces as a sure
refuge.
For lo, the kings of the earth: are gathered, and gone by together.
They marvelled to see such things: they were astonished, and suddenly cast
down.
Fear came there upon them, and sorrow: as upon a woman in her travail.
Thou shalt break the ships of the sea: through the east wind.
Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the
city of our God: God upholdeth the same for ever.
We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God: in the midst of thy temple.
O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's end: thy right
hand is full of righteousness.
Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad: because of thy
judgements.
Walk about Sion, and go round about her: and tell the towers thereof.
Mark well her bulwarks, set up her houses: that ye may tell them that come
after.
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he shall be our guide unto death.
<h3>Psalm 48</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O HEAR ye this, all ye people: ponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the
world;
High and low, rich and poor: one with another.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom: and my heart shall muse of understanding.
I will incline mine ear to the parable: and shew my dark speech upon the harp.
Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness: and when the wickedness of
my heels compasseth me round about?
There be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches.
But no man may deliver his brother: nor make agreement unto God for him;
For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that alone for ever;
Yea, though he live long: and see not the grave.
For he seeth that wise men also die, and perish together: as well as the ignorant
and foolish, and leave their riches for other.
And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever: and that their
dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the
lands after their own names.
Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour: seeing that he may be compared
unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them.
This is their foolishness: and their posterity praise their saying.
They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and the righteous shall
have domination over them in the morning: their beauty shall consume in
the sepulchre out of their dwelling.
But God hath delivered my soul from the place of hell: for he shall receive me.
Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich: or if the glory of his house be
increased.
For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth: neither shall his pomp
follow him.
For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man: and so long as thou doest
well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.
He shall follow the generation of his fathers: and shall never see light.
Man being in honour hath no understanding: but is compared unto the beasts
that perish.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 49</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
THE Lord, even the most mighty God, hath spoken: and called the world, from
the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Out of Sion hath God appeared: in perfect beauty.
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: there shall go before him a
consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up round about him.
He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth, that he may judge his people.
Gather my saints together unto me: those that have made a covenant with me
with sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is Judge himself.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak: I myself will testify against thee, O Israel;
for I am God, even thy God.
I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt-offerings:
because they were not alway before me.
I will take no bullock out of thine house: nor he-goat out of thy folds.
For all the beasts of the forest are mine: and so are the cattle upon a thousand
hills.
I know all the fowls upon the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are in
my sight.
If I be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the whole world is mine, and all that is
therein.
Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh: and drink the blood of goats?
Offer unto God thanksgiving: and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.
And call upon me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise
me.
But unto the ungodly said God: Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my
covenant in thy mouth;
Whereas thou hatest to be reformed: and has cast my words behind thee?
When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him: and hast been partaker
with the adulterers.
Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness: and with thy tongue thou hast set
forth deceit.
Thou satest, and spakest against thy brother: yea, and hast slandered thine own
mother's son.
These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest
wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and
set before thee the things that thou hast done.
O consider this, ye that forget God: lest I pluck you away, and there be none to
deliver you.
Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation right will I shew the salvation of God.
<h3>Psalm 50</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to
Bathsheba
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according to the
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.
Wash me throughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.
Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin hath my mother conceived me.
But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand
wisdom secretly.
Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice.
Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.
Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health: and
my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.
Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy praise.
For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou delightest not in
burnt-offerings.
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt
thou not despise.
O be favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burntofferings and oblations: then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine
altar.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 51</h3>
For the end. A psalm of instruction by David, when Doeg the Idumean came and told Saul that
David had gone to the house of Abimelech
WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant: that thou canst do mischief;
Whereas the goodness of God: endureth yet daily?
Thy tongue imagineth wickedness: and with lies thou cuttest like a sharp rasor.
Thou hast loved unrighteousness more then goodness: and to talk of lies more
than righteousness.
Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt: O thou false tongue.
Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever: he shall take thee, and pluck thee out
of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of the living.
The righteous also shall see this, and fear: and shall laugh him to scorn;
Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength: but trusted unto the
multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: my trust is in the
tender mercy of God for ever and ever.
I will always give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done: and I will hope in thy
Name, for thy saints like it well.
<h3>Psalm 52</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David upon Maeleth, of instruction
THE foolish body hath said in his heart: There is no God.
Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness: there is none that
doeth good.
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there were any
that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is also none that doeth good, no not one.
Are not they without understanding, that work wickedness: eating up my people
as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.
They were afraid where no fear was: for God hath broken the bones of him that
besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because God hath despised
them.
O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion: O that the Lord would
deliver his people out of captivity!
Then should Jacob rejoice: and Israel should be right glad.
<h3>Psalm 53</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of instruction by David. When the Ziphites came and said to Saul,
Lo, is not David hid with us?
SAVE me, O God, for thy Name's sake: and avenge me in thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God: and hearken unto the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me: and tyrants, which have not God before
their eyes, seek after my soul.
Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy truth.
An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O Lord: because
it is so comfortable.
For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire
upon mine enemies.
<h3>Psalm 54</h3>
For the end. Among hymns of instruction by David
HEAR my prayer, O God: and hide not thyself from my petition.
Take heed unto me, and hear me: how I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed.
The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast: for they are minded to
do me some mischief; so maliciously are they set against me.
My heart is disquieted within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me: and an horrible dread hath
overwhelmed me.
And I said, O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I flee away, and be at
rest.
Lo, then would I get me away far off: and remain in the wilderness.
I would make haste to escape: because of the stormy wind and tempest.
Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them: for I have spied unrighteousness
and strife in the city.
Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow
are in the midst of it.
Wickedness is therein: deceit and guile go not out of their streets.
For it is not an open enemy, that hath done me this dishonour: for then I could
have borne it.
Neither was it mine adversary, that did magnify himself against me: for then
peradventure I would have hid myself from him.
But it was even thou, my companion: my guide, and mine own familiar friend.
We took sweet counsel together: and walked in the house of God as friends.
Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for
wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord shall save me.
In the evening, and morning, and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly: and
he shall hear my voice.
It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
for there were many with me.
Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them down: for
they will not turn, nor fear God.
He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him: and he brake his covenant.
The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart: his
words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very swords.
O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: and shall not suffer
the righteous to fall for ever.
And as for them: thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction.
The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days:
nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.

<h3>Psalm 55</h3>
For the end. Concerning the people that were removed from the sanctuary. By David for a
memorial, when the Philistines caught him in Gath
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me: he is daily
fighting, and troubling me.
Mine enemies are daily in hand to swallow me up: for they be many that fight
against me, O thou most Highest.
Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid: yet put I my trust in thee.
I will praise God, because of his word: I have put my trust in God, and will not
fear what flesh can do unto me.
They daily mistake my words: all that they imagine is to do me evil.
They hold all together, and keep themselves close: and mark my steps, when
they lay wait for my soul.
Shall they escape for their wickedness: thou, O God, in thy displeasure shalt cast
them down.
Thou tellest my flittings; put my tears into thy bottle: are not these things noted
in thy book?
Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight: this I
know; for God is on my side.
In God's word I will rejoice: in the Lord's word will I comfort me.
Yea, in God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows: unto thee will I give thanks.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling: that I may
walk before God in the light of the living.
<h3>Psalm 56</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David, for a memorial. When he fled from the presence of Saul to
the cave
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, be merciful unto me, for my soul trusteth in
thee: and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until this
tyranny be over-past.
I will call unto the most high God: even unto the God that shall perform the
cause which I have in hand.
He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him that would eat
me up.
God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among lions.
And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are
spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they have digged a
pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, and give praise.
Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee
among the nations.
For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens: and thy truth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 57</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation: and do ye judge the
thing that is right, O ye sons of men?
Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth: and your hands deal with
wickedness.
The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb: as soon as they are
born, they go astray, and speak lies.
They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent: even like the deaf adder that
stoppeth her ears.
Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer: charm he never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; smite the jaw-bones of the lions, O
Lord: let them fall away like water that runneth apace; and when they
shoot their arrows let them be rooted out.
Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of a woman:
and let them not see the sun.
Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns: so let indignation vex him, even as a
thing that is raw.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his
footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: doubtless
there is a God that judgeth the earth.

<h3>Psalm 58</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David for a memorial, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill
him
DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God: defend me from them that rise up
against me.
O deliver me from the wicked doers: and save me from the blood-thirsty men.
For lo, they lie waiting for my soul: the mighty men are gathered against me,
without any offence or fault of me, O Lord.
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: arise thou therefore to help
me, and behold.
Stand up, O Lord God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the heathen: and be
not merciful unto them that offend of malicious wickedness.
They go to and fro in the evening: they grin like a dog, and run about through the
city.
Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips: for who doth
hear?
But thou. O Lord, shalt have them in derision: and thou shalt laugh all the
heathen to scorn.
My strength will I ascribe unto thee: for thou art the God of my refuge.
God sheweth me his goodness plenteously: and God shall let me see my desire
upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget it: but scatter them abroad among the
people, and put them down, O Lord, our defence.
For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be taken in
their pride: and why? their preaching is of cursing and lies.
Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish: and know that
it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.
And in the evening they will return: grin like a dog, and will go about the city.
They will run here and there for meat: and grudge if they be not satisfied.
As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betimes in the
morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
trouble.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my
merciful God.
<h3>Psalm 59</h3>
For the end. For them that shall yet be changed. For an inscription by David for instruction.
When he had burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syrian Sobal, and Joab had returned and smitten
twelve thousand in the Valley of Salt
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad: thou hast also been
displeased; O turn thee unto us again.
Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: heal the sores thereof, for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewed thy people heavy things: thou hast given us a drink of deadly
wine.
Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee: that they may triumph because of
the truth.
Therefore were thy beloved delivered: help me with thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Sichem: and mete out
the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head;
Judah is my law-giver.
Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, be thou glad
of me.
Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou cast us out, O God: wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
O be thou our help in trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Through God will we do great acts: for it is he that shall tread down our enemies.
<h3>Psalm 60</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of David
HEAR my crying, O God: give ear unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth will I call unto thee: when my heart is in heaviness.
O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I: for thou hast been my hope, and
a strong tower for me against the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: and my trust shall be under the covering of
thy wings.
For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires: and hast given an heritage unto those
that fear thy Name.
Thou shalt grant the King a long life: that his years may endure throughout all
generations.
He shall dwell before God for ever: O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness,
that they may preserve him.
So will I always sing praise unto thy Name: that I may daily perform my vows.

<h3>Psalm 61</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David for Idithun
MY SOUL truly waiteth still upon God: for of him cometh my salvation.
He verily is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
greatly fall.
How long will ye imagine mischief against every man: ye shall be slain all the
sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and like a broken hedge.
Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt: their delight is in
lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse with their heart.
Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God: for my hope is in him.
He truly is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
fall.
In God is my health, and my glory: the rock of my might, and in God is my trust.
O put your trust in him alway, ye people: pour out your hearts before him, for
God is our hope.
As for the children of men, they are but vanity: the children of men are deceitful
upon the weights, they are altogether lighter than vanity itself.
O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselves unto vanity: if riches
increase, set not your heart upon them.
God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same: that power belongeth
unto God;
And that thou, Lord, art merciful: for thou rewardest every man according to his
work.
<h3>Psalm 62</h3>
A psalm of David. When he was in the wilderness of Idumea
O GOD, thou art my God: early will I seek thee.
My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee: in a barren and dry
land where no water is.
Thus have I looked for thee in holiness: that I might behold thy power and glory.
For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: my lips shall praise thee.
As long as I live will I magnify thee on this manner: and lift up my hands in thy
Name.
My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness: when my
mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.
Have I not remembered thee in my bed: and thought upon thee when I was
waking?
Because thou hast been my helper: therefore under the shadow of thy wings will
I rejoice.
My soul hangeth upon thee: thy right hand hath upholden me.
These also that seek the hurt of my soul: they shall go under the earth.
Let them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be a portion for foxes.
But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him shall be
commended: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
<h3>Psalm 63</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the gathering together of the froward: and from the insurrection of
wicked doers;
Who have whet their tongue like a sword: and shoot out their arrows, even bitter
words;
That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: suddenly do they hit him, and
fear not.
They encourage themselves in mischief: and commune among themselves how
they may lay snares, and say that no man shall see them.
They imagine wickedness, and practise it: that they keep secret among
themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.
But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow: that they shall be
wounded.
Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall insomuch that whoso seeth them
shall laugh them to scorn.
And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done: for they shall perceive that
it is his work.
The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and put his trust in him: and all they that
are true of heart shall be glad.

The whole world hath thee as refuge, mighty protection and a great bulwark, O Forerunner. By thy prayers deliver us from all oppression. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> God loved thee, the beauty of Jacob, O Virgin Maiden, through thee adorning all who before had enshrouded themselves in gloom through disobedience. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> I have been brought down into Hades * by the abyss of life with my deeds; * but like Jonah who cried out from within the whale, * so do I also cry aloud to Thee: * Lead me up from the depths of evils, I pray Thee,* O Son and Word of God! I have weighed down my soul with the slumber of negligence, wretch that I am, and am brought low by the sleep of sin. Rouse me to the light of repentance, O Lord, and save me by Thy tender compassion. How I have fallen, wretch that I am? How I have withdrawn far from the supremely good God? How I have paid no heed in my senses to the dread tribunal at which I must needs be judged? O my Creator, have pity on me! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye were truly revealed to be like a harp ever playing the song of salvation, delighting the hearts of the faithful, and utterly driving away the drunkenness of deception, O most radiant spiritual athletes. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Passing beyond the limits of man to the Creator, by divine exaltation, O martyrs of Christ, rejoicing, ye endured the tortures of martyrdom as though your bodies were not your own. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O all-holy Virgin, intercessor and protection of all the faithful, stand forth and deliver me from the impending threat and the dread trial at the hour of judgment, that I may ever hymn thee with faith. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> I have reached the depths of the sea * and the tempest of my many sins hath engulfed me; * but do Thou raise up my life from the abyss * O Greatly-merciful One. Thou didst stand in the stream's currents, baptizing the Master Who taketh away the sins of all mankind. Him do thou never cease to entreat, O Forerunner, that He have pity on our souls. O Forerunner, thou wast shown to be a preacher of repentance, wherein do thou keep my heart, which hath been defiled by harmful sins, and lacks recovery. O blessed one, in the trackless wilderness thou didst proclaim to souls the coming of the Word Who was to arrive; wherefore, the whole Church blesseth thee with unceasing voices. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The images of the law were made clear by thine awesome birthgiving, O Bride of God; and, seeing their fulfillment now, O Lady, we fittingly honor thee. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The children of Abraham, refusing to worship the golden image, * were tried like gold in a crucible; * and they joined chorus in the fiery furnace, * as in a splendid bridal-chamber, chanting: * Blessed art Thou, O God of our fathers!

O Savior, Who once saved Manasseh who repented, and had pity on the harlot who wept, and didst justify the thief by Thy word, accept me also, who have committed many and grievous sins against Thee, but cry aloud: Blessed is the God of our fathers! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> When the cruel storm of polytheism smote the whole world, O passion-bearers, ye made yourselves ships of piety and reached the harbor of life by the piloting of Christ; and ye cry aloud: Blessed is the God of our fathers! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Manifestly enlightened from on high, and tried by tortures like gold in a crucible, the spiritual athletes were shown to be precious seals of the sufferings of Christ, and have now been deposited in the treasuries of heaven, in great security. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Having given birth in the flesh to the Savior and God, the Redeemer and Master, O most pure Lady, pray thou ever unto Him, O most pure one, that, having received release from evils and the remission of our many sins, we may glorify His compassions which pass understanding. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Of old the Children of Abraham in Babylon * trampled down the flame of the furnace, * crying aloud with hymns: * O God of our Fathers, blessed art Thou.

By thy vigil and prayers to the Redeemer of all, O Forerunner John, still every storm stirred up by the enemy against me, for with faith I have recourse unto thee. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Virgin, from the assaults and lot of the evil one and from, slavery to the demons preserve thou thy servants, who with soul and tongue ever glorify thee. </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> In the flames of the divine fire * The cherubim and seraphim stand before Thee, O Lord, * and all creation doth chant beauteous hymns to Thee: * O ye people hymn, bless and supremely exalt Christ, the one Creator, * throughout all ages!

As the Lover of mankind, O Savior, freely have pity on me, and turn not away from me.

The sentence is inescapable for those who do not act with mercy. Take then the oil which replenishes thy lamp, and keep it un-extinguished, for the Bridegroom draweth nigh.

<h3>Psalm 64</h3>
For the end. A psalm and song of David
THOU, O God, art praised in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed in
Jerusalem.
Thou that hearest the prayer: unto thee shall all flesh come.
My misdeeds prevail against me: O be thou merciful unto our sins.
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: he shall dwell
in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house, even of
thy holy temple.
Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation: thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that remain in the broad sea.
Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains: and is girded about with power.
Who stilleth the raging of the sea: and the noise of his waves, and the madness of
the people.
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afraid at thy
tokens: thou that makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
praise thee.
Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very plenteous.
The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest
for the earth.
Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof: thou
makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop fatness.
They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and the little hills shall
rejoice on every side.
The folds shall be full of sheep: the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn,
that they shall laugh and sing.
<h3>Psalm 65</h3>
For the end. A song of a plasm of resurrection
O BE joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of his Name, make
his praise to be glorious.
Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the greatness of
thy power shall thine enemies be found liars unto thee.
For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy Name.
O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is in his doing
toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the water on foot;
there did we rejoice thereof.
He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people: and such as will
not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.
O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to slip.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our loins.
Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water, and
thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay thee my vows, which I
promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of rams: I will offer
bullocks and goats.
O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what he hath
done for my soul.
I called unto him with my mouth: and gave him praises with my tongue.
If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart: the Lord will not hear me.
But God hath heard me: and considered the voice of my prayer.
Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned his mercy from me.
<h3>Psalm 66</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns
GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his countenance,
and be merciful unto us:
That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the folk righteously,
and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God, shall
give us his blessing.
God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 67</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song of David
LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee
before him.
Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away: and like as wax
melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the presence of God.
But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them also be merry and
joyful .
O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name: magnify him that rideth upon
the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise him in his Name JAH, and
rejoice before him.
He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows: even God
in his holy habitation.
He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the
prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates continue in scarceness.
O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through
the wilderness;
The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God: even as Sinai
also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.
Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreshedst it
when it was weary.
Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness
prepared for the poor.
The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers.
Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited: and they of the household
divided the spoil.
Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove: that
is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.
When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake: then were they as white as
snow in Salmon.
As the hill of Basan, so is God's hill: even an high hill, as the hill of Basan.
Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which it pleaseth him to
dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: and the Lord
is among them, as in the holy place of Sinai.
Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for
men: yea, even for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among
them.
Praised be the Lord daily: even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his benefits
upon us.
He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is the Lord, by
whom we escape death.
God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalp of such a one as
goeth on still in his wickedness.
The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan: mine own
will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the tongue of
thy dogs may be red through the same.
It is well seen, O God, how thou goest: how thou, my God and King, goest in the
sanctuary.
The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the damsels
playing with the timbrels.
Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations: from the ground
of the heart.
There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their counsel: the
princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.
Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing, O God, that thou
hast wrought in us,
For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem: so shall kings bring presents unto thee.
When the company of the spear-men, and multitude of the mighty are scattered
abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they humbly bring pieces of
silver: and when he hath scattered the people that delight in war;
Then shall the princes come out of Eqypt: the Morians' land shall soon stretch
our her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord;
Who sitteth in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he doth send out his
voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.
Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel: his worship and strength is in the
clouds.
O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: even the God of Israel, he will give
strength and power unto his people; blessed be God.

<h3>Psalm 68</h3>
For the end. A Psalm of David for alternate verses
SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.
I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is: I am come into deep waters, so
that the floods run over me.
I am weary of crying; my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for waiting so long
upon my God.
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that
are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.
I paid them the things that I never took: God, thou knowest my simpleness, and
my faults are not hid from thee.
Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my cause:
let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of
Israel.
And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof: shame hath covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an alien unto my mother's
children.
For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me: and the rebukes of them that
rebuked thee are fallen upon me.
I wept, and chastened myself with fasting: and that was turned to my reproof.
I put on sackcloth also: and they jested upon me.
They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs upon
me.
But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.
Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the truth of thy salvation.
Take me out of the mire, that I sink not: O let me be delivered from them that
hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up: and let
not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable: turn thee unto me
according to the multitude of thy mercies.
And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: O haste thee, and
hear me.
Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: O deliver me, because of mine enemies.
Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are
all in thy sight.
Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to
have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.
They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and let the things that
should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.
Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not: and ever bow thou down their backs.
Pour out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold
of them.
Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they talk how they may vex
them whom thou hast wounded.
Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and not come into thy
righteousness.
Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be written among the
righteous.
As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God, shall lift me up.
I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with thanksgiving.
This also shall please the Lord: better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God, and your soul
shall live.
For the Lord heareth the poor: and despiseth not his prisoners.
Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea, and all that moveth therein.
For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah: that men may dwell there,
and have it in possession.
The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his Name
shall dwell therein.
<h3>Psalm 69</h3>
For the end. By David for a remembrance; that the Lord may save me
HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned
backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.
Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame: that cry over me, There,
there.
But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let all such as
delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and in misery: haste thee unto me, O God.
Thou art my helper and my redeemer: O Lord, make no long tarrying.

        </p><h3>THE READING IS FROM ISAIAH </h3><p>Thus saith the Lord: Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people  be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them  bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: our let them hear, and say, It is  truth. Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen:  that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was  no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the LORD; and beside  me there is no savior. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there  was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I  am God. Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of  my hand: I will work, and who shall let it? Thus saith the LORD, your Redeemer, the  Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all  their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. Thus saith the Lord. The  Holy One of Israel </p><h3>THE READING IS FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON </h3><p>The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God, and there shall no torment  touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die, and their departure is  taken for misery, and their going from us to be utter destruction, but they are in  peace. For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of  immortality. And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded, for  God proved them and found them worthy for Himself. As gold in the furnace hath  He tried them, and received them as a burnt offering. And in the time of their  visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. They  shall judge the nations and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign  for ever. They that put their trust in Him shall understand the truth; and such as be  faithful in love shall abide with Him; for grace and mercy is to His saints and  visitation for His elect.  </p><h3>THE READING IS FROM FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON </h3><p>The righteous live unto the ages; their reward is also with the Lord, and the care  of them is with the most High. Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom and a  beautiful crown from the Lord’s hand, for with His right hand shall He cover them,  and with His arm shall He protect them. He shall take to Him His jealousy for  complete armor, and make the creature His weapon for the revenge of His enemies.  He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate and true judgment instead of an helmet.  He shall take holiness for an invincible shield. His severe wrath shall He sharpen for a  sword, and the world shall fight with Him against the unwise. Then shall the right- arming thunderbolts go abroad, and from the clouds, as from a welldrawn bow, shall  they fly to the mark. And from the hailstones full of wrath and cast as out of a sin  Tone bow the cities shall fall down, and the water of the sea shall rage against them,  and the floods shall cruelly drown them. Yea, a mighty wind shall stand up against  them, and like a storm shall blow them away; thus iniquity shall lay waste the whole  earth, and ill dealing shall overthrow the Thrones of the mighty. Hear therefore, O ye  kings, and understand; learn ye that be judges of the ends of the earth. Give ear, ye  that rule the people and glory in the multitude of nations, for power is given you of  the Lord and sovereignty from the Highest.

<h3>Psalm 70</h3>
By David. A psalm sung by the sons of Jonadab and the first that were taken captive
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: but rid
me and deliver me in thy righteousness, incline thine ear unto me, and save
me.
Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may alway resort: thou hast promised to
help me, for thou art my house of defence and my castle.
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the hand of the
unrighteous and cruel man.
For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope, even from
my youth.
Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: thou art he that took
me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall be always of thee.
I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is in thee.
O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy glory and honour
all the day long.
Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength faileth
me.
For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul take their
counsel together, saying: God hath forsaken him; persecute him, and take
him, for there is none to deliver him.
Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me.
Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul: let them be covered
with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.
As for me, I will patiently abide alway: and will praise thee more and more.
My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation: for I know no end
thereof.
I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy
righteousness only.
Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I tell of
thy wondrous works.
Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed: until I have
shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that
are yet for to come.
Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are they that thou hast
done; O God, who is like unto thee?
O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me, and yet didst thou
turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth
again.
Thou hast brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every side.
Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an
instrument of musick: unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Holy One
of Israel.
My lips will be fain when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul whom thou hast
delivered.
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are
confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.
<h3>Psalm 71</h3>
For Solomon
GIVE the King thy judgements, O God: and thy righteousness unto the King's
son.
Then shall he judge thy people according unto right: and defend the poor.
The mountains also shall bring peace: and the little hills righteousness unto the
people.
He shall keep the simple folk by their right: defend the children of the poor, and
punish the wrong-doer.
They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth: from one generation
to another.
He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool: even as the drops that
water the earth.
In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea, and abundance of peace, so long as
the moon endureth.
His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other: and from the flood unto
the world's end.
They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him: his enemies shall lick
the dust.
The kings of Tharsis and of the isles shall give presents: the kings of Arabia and
Saba shall bring gifts.
All kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do him service.
For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth: the needy also, and him that hath
no helper.
He shall be favourable to the simple and needy: and shall preserve the souls of
the poor.
He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong: and dear shall their blood
be in his sight.
He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia: prayer shall be
made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.
There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills: his fruit shall
shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city like grass upon the earth.
His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the
posterities: which shall be blessed through him; and all the heathen shall
praise him.
Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel: which only doeth wondrous
things;
And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: and all the earth shall be filled
with his majesty. Amen, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 72</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
TRULY God is loving unto Israel: even unto such as are of a clean heart.
Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone: my treadings had well-nigh slipt.
And why? I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such
prosperity.
For they are in no peril of death: but are lusty and strong.
They come in no misfortune like other folk: neither are they plagued like other
men.
And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride: and overwhelmed with
cruelty.
Their eyes swell with fatness: and they do even what they lust.
They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy: their talking is against the
most High.
For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their tongue goeth
through the world.
Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no small advantage.
Tush, say they, how should God perceive it: is there knowledge in the most High?
Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in
possession: and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed
mine hands in innocency.
All the day long have I been punished: and chastened every morning.
Yea, and I had almost said even as they: but lo, then I should have condemned
the generation of thy children.
Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me,
Until I went into the sanctuary of God: then understood I the end of these men;
Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places: and castest them down, and
destroyest them.
O how suddenly do they consume: perish, and come to a fearful end!
Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh: so shalt thou make their image to
vanish out of the city.
Thus my heart was grieved: and it went even through my reins.
So foolish was I, and ignorant: even as it were a beast before thee.
Nevertheless, I am alway by thee: for thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel: and after that receive me with glory.
Whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth that I desire in
comparison of thee.
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my
portion for ever.
For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that
commit fornication against thee.
But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord God: and
to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
<h3>Psalm 73</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot
against the sheep of thy pasture?
O think upon thy congregation: whom thou hast purchased and redeemed of old.
Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance: and mount Sion, wherein thou hast
dwelt.
Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy: which hath done
evil in thy sanctuary.
Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations: and set up their
banners for tokens.
He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees: was known to bring it to an
excellent work.
But now they break down all the carved work thereof: with axes and hammers.
They have set fire upon thy holy places: and have defiled the dwelling-place of
thy Name, even unto the ground.
Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether: thus have
they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.
We see not our tokens, there is not one prophet more: no, not one is there among
us, that understandeth any more.
O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour: how long shall the enemy
blaspheme thy Name, for ever?
Why withdrawest thou thy hand: why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy
bosom to consume the enemy?
For God is my King of old: the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself.
Thou didst divide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the
dragons in the waters.
Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces: and gavest him to be meat for the
people in the wilderness.
Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks: thou driedst up
mighty waters.
The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked: and how the foolish
people hath blasphemed thy Name.
O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the enemies: and
forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.
Look upon the covenant: for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel
habitations.
O let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the poor and needy give praise
unto thy Name.
Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
blasphemeth thee daily.
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the presumption of them that hate thee
increaseth ever more and more.

<h3>Psalm 74</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: A psalm of a song for Asaph
UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks: yea, unto thee do we give thanks.
Thy Name also is so nigh: and that do thy wondrous works declare.
When I receive the congregation: I shall judge according unto right.
The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the pillars of it.
I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly: and to the ungodly, Set not up your horn.
Set not up your horn on high: and speak not with a stiff neck.
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west: nor yet from the
south.
And why? God is the Judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixed,
and he poureth out of the same.
As for the dregs thereof: all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and suck
them out.
But I will talk of the God of Jacob: and praise him for ever.
All the horns of the ungodly also will I break: and the horns of the righteous shall
be exalted.
<h3>Psalm 75</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns, a psalm for Asaph: A song for the Assyrian
IN JEWRY is God known: his Name is great in Israel.
At Salem is his tabernacle: and his dwelling in Sion.
There brake he the arrows of the bow: the shield, the sword, and the battle.
Thou art of more honour and might: than the hills of the robbers.
The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep: and all the men whose hands
were mighty have found nothing.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob: both the chariot and horse are fallen.
Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when thou art
angry?
Thou didst cause thy judgement to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled,
and was still;
When God arose to judgement: and to help all the meek upon earth.
The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise: and the fierceness of them shalt
thou refrain.
Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that are round about him:
bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
He shall refrain the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among the kings of the
earth.
<h3>Psalm 76</h3>
For the end. For Idithun, a psalm of Asaph
I WILL cry unto God with my voice: even unto God will I cry with my voice, and
he shall hearken unto me.
In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran and ceased not in the
night-season ; my soul refused comfort.
When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God: when my heart is vexed, I will
complain.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble, that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old: and the years that are past.
I call to remembrance my song: and in the night I commune with mine own
heart, and search out my spirits.
Will the Lord absent himself for ever: and will he be no more intreated?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly to an end for
evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his loving-kindness in
displeasure?
And I said, It is mine own infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right
hand of the most Highest.
I will remember the works of the Lord: and call to mind thy wonders of old time.
I will think also of all thy works: and my talking shall be of thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is holy: who is so great a God as our God?
Thou art the God that doeth wonders: and hast declared thy power among the
people.
Thou hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid: the depths
also were troubled.
The clouds poured out water, the air thundered: and thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: the lightnings shone upon the
ground: the earth was moved, and shook withal.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and thy footsteps are
not known.
Thou leddest thy people like sheep: by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<h3>Psalm 77</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
HEAR my law, O my people: incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hard sentences of old;
Which we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told us;
That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to come: but
to shew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he
hath done.
He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law: which he commanded our
forefathers to teach their children;
That their posterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn;
To the intent that when they came up: they might shew their children the same;
That they might put their trust in God: and not to forget the works of God, but to
keep his commandments;
And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation: a
generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not
stedfastly unto God;
Like as the children of Ephraim: who being harnessed, and carrying bows,
turned themselves back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his law;
But forgat what he had done: and the wonderful works that he had shewed for
them.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt:
even in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea, and let them go through: he made the waters to stand on an
heap.
In the day-time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night through with a
light of fire.
He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness: and gave them drink thereof, as it had
been out of the great depth.
He brought waters out of the stony rock: so that it gushed out like the rivers.
Yet for all this they sinned more against him: and provoked the most Highest in
the wilderness.
They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their lust.
They spake against God also, saying: Shall God prepare a table in the
wilderness?
He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
flowed withal: but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?
When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and
there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;
Because they believed not in God: and put not their trust in his help.
So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.
He rained down manna also upon them for to eat: and gave them food from
heaven.
So man did eat angels' food: for he sent them meat enough.
He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven: and through his power he
brought in the south-west-wind.
He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand
of the sea.
He let it fall among their tents: even round about their habitation.
So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire: they were
not disappointed of their lust.
But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon
them, and slew the wealthiest of them: yea, and smote down the chosen
men that were in Israel.
But for all this they sinned yet more: and believed not his wondrous works.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years in trouble.
When he slew them, they sought him: and turned them early, and inquired after
God.
And they remembered that God was their strength: and that the high God was
their redeemer.
Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and dissembled with him
in their tongue.
For their heart was not whole with him: neither continued they stedfast in his
covenant.
But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds: and destroyed them not.
Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not suffer his whole
displeasure to arise.
For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were even a wind that
passeth away, and cometh not again.
Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness: and grieved him in the
desert.
They turned back, and tempted God: and moved the Holy One in Israel.
They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered them from the
hand of the enemy;
How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
He turned their waters into blood: so that they might not drink of the rivers.
He sent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to destroy them.
He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar: and their labour unto the grasshopper.
He destroyed their vines with hail-stones: and their mulberry-trees with the frost.
He smote their cattle also with hail-stones: and their flocks with hot
thunderbolts.
He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure and trouble:
and sent evil angels among them.
He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death: but gave
their life over to the pestilence;
And smote all the first-born in Egypt: the most principal and mightiest in the
dwellings of Ham.
But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep: and carried them in the
wilderness like a flock.
He brought them out safely, that they should not fear: and overwhelmed their
enemies with the sea.
And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary: even to his mountain
which he purchased with his right hand.
He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land to be divided among
them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not his testimonies;
But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers: starting aside like a
broken bow.
For they grieved him with their hill-altars: and provoked him to displeasure with
their images.
When God heard this, he was wroth: and took sore displeasure at Israel.
So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that he had pitched
among men.
He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with his inheritance.
The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not given to
marriage.
Their priests were slain with the sword: and there were no widows to make
lamentation.
So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep: and like a giant refreshed with wine.
He smote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a perpetual shame.
He refused the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
But chose the tribe of Judah: even the hill of Sion which he loved.
And there he built his temple on high: and laid the foundation of it like the
ground which he hath made continually.
He chose David also his servant: and took him away from the sheep-folds.
As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him: that he might
feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
So he fed them with a faithful and true heart: and ruled them prudently with all
his power.

<h3>Psalm 78</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they
defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the
air: and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.
Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem: and there was
no man to bury them.
We are become an open shame to our enemies: a very scorn and derision unto
them that are round about us.
Lord, how long wilt thou be angry: shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?
Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee: and upon
the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.
For they have devoured Jacob: and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon: for we are
come to great misery.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: O deliver us, and be
merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake.
Wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?
O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed: be openly shewed upon
the heathen in our sight.
O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to the
greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die.
And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee: reward
thou them , O Lord, seven-fold into their bosom.
So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for
ever: and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to
generation.
<h3>Psalm 79</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses. A testimony for Asaph: a Psalm concerning the Assyrian
HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep: shew
thyself also, thou that sittest upon the cherubims.
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses: stir up thy strength, and come, and
help us.
Turn us again, O God: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
O Lord God of hosts: how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears: and givest them plenteousness of
tears to drink.
Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh us
to scorn.
Turn us again, thou God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall
be whole.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and
planted it.
Thou madest room for it: and when it had taken root it filled the land.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it: and the boughs thereof were like
the goodly cedar-trees.
She stretched out her branches unto the sea: and her boughs unto the river.
Why hast thou then broken down her hedge: that all they that go by pluck off her
grapes?
The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up: and the wild beasts of the field
devour it.
Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven: behold, and visit this
vine;
And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted: and the branch
that thou madest so strong for thyself.
It is burnt with fire, and cut down: and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy
countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man, whom
thou madest so strong for thine own self.
And so will not we go back from thee: O let us live, and we shall call upon thy
Name.
Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.
<h3>Psalm 80</h3>

Jacob.
Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret: the merry harp with the lute.
Blow up the trumpet in the new-moon: even in the time appointed, and upon our
solemn feast-day.
For this was made a statute for Israel: and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony: when he came out of the land of
Egypt, and had heard a strange language.
I eased his shoulder from the burden: and his hands were delivered from making
the pots.
Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee: and heard thee what
time as the storm fell upon thee.
I proved thee also: at the waters of strife.
Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel: if thou wilt hearken unto me,
There shall no strange god be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any other god.
I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy
mouth wide, and I shall fill it.
But my people would not hear my voice: and Israel would not obey me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts: and let them follow their own
imaginations.
O that my people would have hearkened unto me: for if Israel had walked in my
ways,
I should soon have put down their enemies: and turned my hand against their
adversaries.
The haters of the Lord should have been found liars: but their time should have
endured for ever.
He should have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour: and with honey out of
the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

Defend the poor and fatherless: see that such as are in need and necessity have
right.
Deliver the outcast and poor: save them from the hand of the ungodly.
They will not be learned nor understand, but walk on still in darkness: all the

I have said, Ye are gods: and ye are all the children of the most Highest.
But ye shall die like men: and fall like one of the princes.

<h3>Psalm 82</h3>
A song of a psalm for Asaph
HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: refrain not thyself, O God.
For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring: and they that hate thee have lift up
their head.
They have imagined craftily against thy people: and taken counsel against thy
secret ones.
They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people:
and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
For they have cast their heads together with one consent: and are confederate
against thee;
The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismaelites: the Moabites and
Hagarenes;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek: the Philistines, with them that dwell at Tyre.
Assur also is joined with them: and have holpen the children of Lot.
But do thou to them as unto the Madianites: unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the
brook of Kison;
Who perished at Endor: and became as the dung of the earth.
Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeb: yea, make all their princes like
as Zeba and Salmana;
Who say, Let us take to ourselves: the houses of God in possession.
O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and as the stubble before the wind;
Like as the fire that burneth up the wood: and as the flame that consumeth the
mountains.
Persecute them even so with thy tempest: and make them afraid with thy storm.
Make their faces ashamed, O Lord: that they may seek thy Name.
Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more: let them be put to
shame, and perish.
And they shall know that thou, whose Name is Jehovah: art only the most Highest
over all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 83</h3>
For the end. A song for the sons of Core, concerning the winepresses
O HOW amiable are thy dwellings: thou Lord of hosts!
My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the Lord: my heart
and my flesh rejoice in the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest where she may
lay her young: even thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be alway praising thee.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are thy ways.
Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well: and the pools are filled
with water.
They will go from strength to strength: and unto the God of gods appeareth every
one of them in Sion.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer :hearken, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our defender: and look upon the face of thine Anointed.
For one day in thy courts: is better than a thousand.
I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God: than to dwell in the tents
of ungodliness.
For the Lord God is a light and defence: the Lord will give grace and worship,
and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a godly life.
O Lord God of hosts: blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 84</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou hast turned away the
captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people: and covered all their sins.
Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure: and turned thyself from thy wrathful
indignation.
Turn us then, O God our Saviour: and let thine anger cease from us.
Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever: and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from
one generation to another?
Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Shew us thy mercy, O Lord: and grant us thy salvation.
I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak
peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again.
For his salvation is nigh them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each
other.
Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness hath looked down from
heaven.
Yea, the Lord shall shew loving-kindness: and our land shall give her increase.
Righteousness shall go before him: and he shall direct his going in the way.

Though higher than all honor, Thou didst endure dishonor, that Thou mightest honor me who have wickedly dishonored myself, O Lover of mankind; and Thou savest me by Thy Cross. Thou wast lifted up upon the Cross and died, O Lord, making the slayer of my soul dead and full of all shame. And now, O my Creator, I hymn Thy power. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The most evil one, who wounded you, was wounded by your incurable torments and was cast down beneath your feet, martyrs; and is seen to be mocked by all. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The dust of the martyrs’ relics, which lieth in the grave, poureth forth healings and scattereth the demons like dust; healing the divers sicknesses of mortals. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “The council of the violators of the law affixed Thee to the Cross with nails; and I now rend my heart with the sword of grief, O my Son!” cried out the Virgin, weeping. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. O Virgin, thine Offspring is the Destroyer of death and the Life and Deliverance of those who die; wherefore, I beseech thee: Raise up my soul, which hath been slain. O Lover of mankind, by the intercessions of Thy Mother and of the countless hosts on high extend a helping hand unto me, who am tempest-tossed upon the deep of life. O field who gavest rise to the divine Grain, disdain not my soul, which hath been weakened and withered amid, a famine of godly acts, but water it with the divine grace of thy Son. Lull to sleep the movements of my bodily passions, and make the uprisings of my flesh subject to my mind, as if they were like a mule, O pure one, calming them with thy prayers as with sleep.  </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> In the Persian furnace the youths and descendants of Abraham, * burning with a love of piety * rather than by a flame of fire, * cried aloud saying: * Blessed art Thou in the temple of Thy glory, O Lord. O only Eternal and Immortal One, Who dost array the skies with clouds, and Who didst will to be crucified naked upon the Tree: Thou hast clothed in shame him who of old stripped our forefather naked. Thou wast lifted up upon the Cross raising up fallen Adam; Thou wast pierced in the side with a spear, O Master, and the greatly crafty one was dealt a mortal blow. Blessed is Thy might, O Lord! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Though most beautifully united to the most comely Word, O all-praised spiritual athletes, ye have not separated yourselves from the world; and though ye were bound and broken, ye ever trample the enemy underfoot. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> By your divine sufferings, O glorious spiritual athletes, ye truly cast down the walls of the citadel of deception; and ye have been revealed to be bulwarks and fortresses for the faithful, who piously bless you. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Maiden seeing Christ God, Who put forth dew in the furnace and in nowise consumed thy Womb, hanging upon the Tree, thou didst glorify His condescension, which was beyond thy comprehension. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. O Maiden, thou divine mountain, from whence the Stone was quarried Who crushed the pillars of the idols: Do away with the graven images of my soul and the stony doubt of my heart. As the one who received in thy womb Him Whose gaze brought about the earth and causeth all that is in it to tremble when He so desireth, thou wast not shaken, O Maiden; wherefore, make me who am shaken by the assaults of the enemy steadfast. Casting down my carnal-mindedness, O Theotokos, show me to be wholly spiritual, adorned with the virtues, though the most evil one hath cast darkness over me by the ugliness of pleasures. O divine bowl of tender compassion and goodness, pour forth upon me in abundance the wealth of thy compassions, washing away the defilement of my transgressions; and quench thou the burning of my flesh. </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Having spread his hands, Daniel closed the lions jaws * in their den; * while the zealously pious youths, * girded with virtue, * quenched the power of the fire and cried aloud: * Bless ye the Lord, all ye works of the Lord. Thou didst extend Thy hands upon the Cross, O Master, desiring to cure the transgression of unrestrained hands, and wast transfixed with nails, O Lord, removing all the passion-fraught understanding of the first-formed man, who singeth: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! By the piercing of Thy divine side the record of first-formed Adam was torn asunder, O Master; and by the drops of Thy blood is the whole earth sanctified, which ever uttereth cries of thanksgiving: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The all-glorious martyrs stood in the midst of the fire as ones bedewed and unconsumed, truly chanting in mystic harmony the divine hymn of the youths: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Enduring the flickering fire by the power of your will, O martyrs, ye were not moved to vanity by your myriad torments; but, strengthened by God, ye hastened to the never-waning light, crying: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Seeing Christ, Who slew the enemy who brought death upon mankind, being put to death, the all-hymned Lady weeping hymned Him as Master; and marveling at His long-suffering, cried aloud: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. Thou hast given birth to the ripe Fruit, O Mistress, and eating of it death hath perished; wherefore, I cry unto thee: Grant life unto me who by deception have been slain by the fruit of sin, yet who cries aloud: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! With thy vigilant prayers, lull to sleep the passion-fraught movements of my mind, O most pure Lady, and rouse me from the sleep of slothfulness, that in vigilance of soul I may chant: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! O Theotokos, break asunder the bonds of my transgressions and still the uprisings of my body; hew down my wicked devisings, and quickly cleanse thy servant of secret thoughts, O intercessor and deliverance of all the faithful. Art thou not afraid, O my soul, that thy countless evil deeds will be accusers indicting thee? Wherefore; repent before the Supremely good One, and take the only most pure one to be thine ally, for she is a refuge for all mankind.

Behold, the Life of all appeared, hanging upon the Cross; and the sun, unable to endure the sight, withdrew its rays, the earth quaked, and the thoughts of the faithful are made steadfast in piety and purity. How can it be that the iniquitous assembly hath condemned to die upon the Tree Thee, the Giver of the law, Who art the Life and Lord of all, and Who through Thy sufferings poured forth immortality upon all mankind? </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> In the midst of lawless enemies ye wisely preached the incarnation of the Word of God with your divinely eloquent mouths, O all-praised ones; and having suffered in a sacred manner, ye have been crowned with wreaths of victory. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Like radiant daystars ye illumine all creation with the brilliance of sacred sufferings and the divine splendors of healings, O godly martyrs, dispelling the deep night of the passions. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O pure one, enlighten my soul, which hath been darkened by sins, and drive away the clouds of mine evils, O cloud of the Light, who of old once beheld the sun dimmed when the Immortal One was crucified. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. Sever the bonds of mine evils with the divine spear of thy Son; and loose thou my wretched soul, which is fettered and in distress, O Virgin Mother of our God, and bind it to the love of Him. O Virgin who art more spacious than the heavens, lead thou my heart up to the broad expanse of dispassion, for it is hemmed in by all the assaults of the adversary, and ever grant me the strength to walk the narrow path. That I may glorify thee who art truly most glorious, O Virgin, deliver me from all the irrationality of sin, and cause me, who flee unto thy mercy, to share in the glory of heaven. Confound all the counsels of those who have arrayed themselves against us, O Mother of God Most High, and fill with joy those who set their hope on thee, that we may all fervently proclaim thy help.

        <h3>THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS (8:28-39)</h3><p>Brethren: We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, 
to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did foreknow, he 
also did predestinate (to be) conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the 
firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also 
called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he 
also glorified. What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be 
against us? He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall 
he not with him also freely give us all things? Who shall lay any thing to the charge of 
God’s elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that 
died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also 
maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall 
tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As 
it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for 
the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that 
loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor 
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor 
depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, 
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
</p><p><i class="note">Alleluia, in Tone IV:</i> The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them, and He 
delivered them out of all their tribulations. 
</p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> Many are the tribulations of the righteous, and the Lord shall deliver 
them out of them all.  
 
<h3>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATHEW (10:16-22)</h3><p>Jesus spake unto his Disciples saying: Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the 
midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. But beware 
of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their 
synagogues; And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a 
testimony against them and the Gentiles. But when they deliver you up, take no 
thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what 
ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh 
in you. And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: 
and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. 
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end 
shall be saved.

<h3>Psalm 85</h3>
A prayer of David
BOW down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor, and in misery.
Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: my God, save thy servant that putteth his
trust in thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I will call daily upon thee.
Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, art good and gracious: and of great mercy unto all them that call
upon thee.
Give ear, Lord, unto my prayer: and ponder the voice of my humble desires.
In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou hearest me.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord: there is not one that can do
as thou doest.
All nations whom thou hadst made shall come and worship thee, O Lord: and
shall glorify thy Name.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in thy truth: O knit my heart unto
thee, that I may fear thy Name.
I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and will praise thy Name for
evermore.
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the
nethermost hell.
O God, the proud are risen against me: and the congregations of naughty men
have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.
But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, plenteous
in goodness and truth.
O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength unto thy
servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.
Shew some token upon me for good, that they who hate me may see it and be
ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
<h3>Psalm 86</h3>
A psalm of a song for the sons of Core
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loveth the gates of Sion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Very excellent things are spoken of thee: thou city of God.
I will think upon Rahab and Babylon: with them that know me.
Behold ye the Philistines also: and they of Tyre, with the Morians; lo, there was
he born.
And of Sion it shall be reported that he was born in her: and the most High shall
stablish her.
The Lord shall rehearse it when he writeth up the people: that he was born
there.
The singers also and trumpeters shall he rehearse: All my fresh springs shall be
in thee.
<h3>Psalm 87</h3>
A song of a psalm for the sons of Core. For the end. Upon Maeleth, for responsive strains.
Concerning instruction for Æman the Israelite
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: O let my
prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling.
For my soul is full of trouble: and my life draweth nigh unto hell.
I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit: and I have been even as a
man that hath no strength.
Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded, and lie in the grave: who
are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit: in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
Thine indignation lieth hard upon me: and thou hast vexed me with all thy
storms.
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me: and made me to be
abhorred of them.
I am so fast in prison: that I cannot get forth.
My sight faileth for very trouble: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have
stretched forth my hands unto thee.
Dost thou shew wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise up again, and
praise thee?
Shall thy loving-kindness be shewed in the grave: or thy faithfulness in
destruction?
Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy righteousness in the
land where all things are forgotten?
Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come before thee.
Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face from me?
I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die: even from my youth
up thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me: and the fear of thee hath undone me.
They came round about me daily like water: and compassed me together on
every side.
My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me: and hid mine acquaintance
out of my sight.

<h3>Psalm 88</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Ætham the Israelite
MY SONG shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the Lord: with my mouth will I
ever be shewing thy truth from one generation to another.
For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever: thy truth shalt thou stablish in the
heavens.
I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn unto David my servant;
Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne from one generation to
another.
O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and thy truth in the
congregation of the saints.
For who is he among the clouds: that shall be compared unto the Lord?
And what is he among the gods: that shall be like unto the Lord?
God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints: and to be had in
reverence of all them that are round about him.
O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee: thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on
every side.
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.
Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it: thou hast scattered thine enemies
abroad with thy mighty arm.
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast laid the foundation of
the round world, and all that therein is.
Thou hast made the north and the south: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy
Name.
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat: mercy and truth shall go
before thy face.
Blessed is the people, O Lord, that can rejoice in thee: they shall walk in the light
of thy countenance.
Their delight shall be daily in thy Name: and in thy righteousness shall they
make their boast.
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy loving-kindness thou shalt lift
up our horns.
For the Lord is our defence: the Holy One of Israel is our King.
Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help
upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
I have found David my servant: with my holy oil have I anointed him.
My hand shall hold him fast: and my arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not be able to do him violence: the son of wickedness shall not
hurt him.
I will smite down his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.
My truth also and my mercy shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be
exalted.
I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand in the floods.
He shall call me, Thou art my Father: my God, and my strong salvation.
And I will make him my first-born: higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast with
him.
His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the days of
heaven.
But if his children forsake my law: and walk not in my judgements;
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I will visit their
offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.
Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my
truth to fail.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: I
have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David.
His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the sun before me.
He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the faithful witness in
heaven.
But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed: and art displeased at him.
Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his crown to the ground.
Thou hast overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong holds.
All they that go by spoil him: and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all his adversaries to
rejoice.
Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword: and givest him not victory in the
battle.
Thou hast put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: and covered him with dishonour.
Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever: and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
O remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men for
nought?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death: and shall he deliver his soul
from the hand of hell?
Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses: which thou swarest unto David in thy
truth?
Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I do bear in my
bosom the rebukes of many people.
Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of
thine Anointed: Praised be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

<h3>Psalm 89</h3>
A prayer of Moses the man of God
LORD, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of
men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a
watch in the night.
As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut down,
dried up and withered.
For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance.
For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our years to an end, as
it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong
that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but labour and
sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.
But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man feareth,
so is thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be glad all the
days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us: and for the years
wherein we have suffered adversity.
Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou the work
of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handywork.
<h3>Psalm 90</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the most High: shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty..
I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my strong hold: my God, in him
will I trust.
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome
pestilence.
He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers:
his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by
day;
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness that destroyeth
in the noon-day.
A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall
not come nigh thee.
Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold: and see the reward of the ungodly.
For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of defence very high.
There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou
tread under thy feet.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him
up, because he hath known my Name.
He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble; I will
deliver him, and bring him to honour.
With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation.

<h3>Psalm 91</h3>
A psalm of a song for the Sabbath-day
IT IS a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy
Name, O most Highest.
To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning: and of thy truth in the nightseason.
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute: upon a loud instrument,
and upon the harp.
For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works: and I will rejoice in giving
praise for the operations of thy hands.
O Lord, how glorious are thy works: thy thoughts are very deep.
An unwise man doth not well consider this: and a fool doth not understand it.
When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish: then shall they be destroyed for ever; but thou,
Lord, art the most Highest for evermore.
For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, lo, thine enemies shall perish: and all the workers
of wickedness shall be destroyed.
But mine horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn: for I am anointed with
fresh oil.
Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies: and mine ear shall hear his
desire of the wicked that arise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar
in Libanus.
Such as are planted in the house of the Lord: shall flourish in the courts of the
house of our God.
They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age: and shall be fat and wellliking.
That they may shew how true the Lord my strength is: and that there is no
unrighteousness in him.
<h3>Psalm 92</h3>
For the day before the Sabbath. When the land was first inhabited, the praise of a song by David
THE Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his
apparel, and girded himself with strength.
He hath made the round world so sure: that it cannot be moved.
Ever since the world began hath thy seat been prepared: thou art from
everlasting.
The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lift up their voice: the floods lift up
their waves.
The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly: but yet the Lord, who
dwelleth on high, is mightier.
Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becometh thine house for ever.
<h3>Psalm 93</h3>
A psalm of David for the fourth day of the week
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth: thou God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself.
Arise, thou Judge of the world: and reward the proud after their deserving.
Lord, how long shall the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly triumph?
How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully: and make such proud
boasting?
They smite down thy people, O Lord: and trouble thine heritage.
They murder the widow and the stranger: and put the fatherless to death.
And yet they say, Tush, the Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob
regard it.
Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the eye, shall he not
see?
Or he that nurtureth the heathen: it is he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not
he punish?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man: that they are but vain.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him in thy law.
That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity: until the pit be digged
up for the ungodly.
For the Lord will not fail his people: neither will he forsake his inheritance;
Until righteousness turn again unto judgement: all such as are true in heart shall
follow it.
Who will rise up with me against the wicked: or who will take my part against
the evil-doers?
If the Lord had not helped me: it had not failed but my soul had been put to
silence.
But when I said, My foot hath slipt: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.
In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart: thy comforts have
refreshed my soul.
Wilt thou have any thing to do with the stool of wickedness: which imagineth
mischief as a law?
They gather them together against the soul of the righteous: and condemn the
innocent blood.
But the Lord is my refuge: and my God is the strength of my confidence.
He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own
malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

<h3>Psalm 94</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
O COME, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our
salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: and shew ourselves glad in
him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God: and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hills is his
also.
The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep
of his hand.
To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the provocation,
and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: It is a people that
do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways;
Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.
<h3>Psalm 95</h3>
When the house was built after the captivity. A song by David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the whole earth.
Sing unto the Lord, and praise his Name: be telling of his salvation from day to
day.
Declare his honour unto the heathen: and his wonders unto all people.
For the Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised: he is more to be feared
than all gods.
As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols: but it is the Lord that made
the heavens.
Glory and worship are before him: power and honour are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people: ascribe unto the Lord
worship and power.
Ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his Name: bring presents, and come
into his courts.
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let the whole earth stand in awe of
him.
Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King: and that it is he who hath
made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; and how that he
shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea make a noise, and
all that therein is.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood
rejoice before the Lord.
For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: and with righteousness to judge
the world, and the people with his truth.
<h3>Psalm 96</h3>
For David, when his land is established
THE Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
may be glad thereof.
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgement are the
habitation of his seat.
There shall go a fire before him: and burn up his enemies on every side.
His lightnings gave shine unto the world: the earth saw it, and was afraid.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord
of the whole earth.
The heavens have declared his righteousness: and all the people have seen his
glory.
Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in vain
gods: worship him, all ye gods.
Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad, because of
thy judgements, O Lord.
For thou, Lord, art higher than all that are in the earth: thou art exalted far
above all gods.
O ye that love the Lord, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: the Lord
preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of
the ungodly.
There is sprung up a light for the righteous: and the joyful gladness for such as
are true-hearted.
Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous: and give thanks for a remembrance of his
holiness.

<h3>Psalm 97</h3>
A Psalm of David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous things.
With his own right hand, and with his holy arm: hath he gotten himself the
victory.
The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the
sight of the heathen.
He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel: and all the
ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.
Shew yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing, rejoice, and give thanks.
Praise the Lord upon the harp: sing to the harp with a psalm of thanksgiving.
With trumpets also and shawms: O shew yourselves joyful before the Lord the
King.
Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round world, and they that
dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together before the
Lord: for he is come to judge the earth.
With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with equity.
<h3>Psalm 98</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord is King, be the people never so unpatient: he sitteth between the
cherubims, be the earth never so unquiet.
The Lord is great in Sion: and high above all people.
They shall give thanks unto thy Name: which is great, wonderful, and holy.
The King's power loveth judgement; thou hast prepared equity: thou hast
executed judgement and righteousness in Jacob.
O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before his footstool, for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call upon his
Name: these called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar: for they kept his testimonies, and
the law that he gave them.
Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou forgavest them, O God, and
punishedst their own inventions.
O magnify the Lord our God, and worship him upon his holy hill: for the Lord our
God is holy.
<h3>Psalm 99</h3>
A psalm for thanksgiving
O BE joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come
before his presence with a song.
Be ye sure that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we
ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:
be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.
For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting: and his truth endureth from
generation to generation.
<h3>Psalm 100</h3>
A Psalm of David
MY SONG shall be of mercy and judgement: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.
O let me have understanding: in the way of godliness.
When wilt thou come unto me: I will walk in my house with a perfect heart.
I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of unfaithfulness: there shall
no such cleave unto me.
A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour: him will I destroy.
Whoso hath also a proud look and high stomach: I will not suffer him.
Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land: that they may dwell with
me.
Whoso leadeth a godly life: he shall be my servant.
There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house: he that telleth lies shall not
tarry in my sight.
I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land: that I may root out all
wicked doers from the city of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 101</h3>
A prayer for the poor, when he is deeply afflicted and pours out his supplication before the Lord
HEAR my prayer, O Lord: and let my crying come unto thee.
Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine ear unto me
when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.
For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt up as it
were a firebrand.
My heart is smitten down, and withered liked grass: so that I forget to eat my
bread.
For the voice of my groaning: my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.
I am become like a pelican in the wilderness: and like an owl that is in the desert.
I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that sitteth alone upon the
house-top.
Mine enemies revile me all the day long: and they that are mad upon me are
sworn together against me.
For I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping.
And that because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and
cast me down.
My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.
But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever: and thy remembrance throughout all
generations.
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that thou have mercy
upon her, yea, the time is come.
And why? thy servants think upon her stones: and it pitieth them to see her in
the dust.
The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy
majesty;
When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall appear;
When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute: and despiseth not
their desire.
This shall be written for those that come after: and the people which shall be
born shall praise the Lord.
For he hath looked down from his sanctuary: out of the heaven did the Lord
behold the earth;
That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity: and deliver the
children appointed unto death;
That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion: and his worship at
Jerusalem;
When the people are gathered together: and the kingdoms also, to serve the
Lord.
He brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.
But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age: as for thy
years, they endure throughout all generations.
Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax old as doth a
garment;
And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art
the same, and thy years shall not fail.
The children of thy servants shall continue: and their seed shall stand fast in thy
sight.
<h3>Psalm 102</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me praise his holy Name.
Praise the Lord, O my soul: and forget not all his benefits;
Who forgiveth all thy sin: and healeth all thine infirmities;
Who saveth thy life from destruction: and crowneth thee with mercy and lovingkindness;
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: making thee young and lusty as an
eagle.
The Lord executeth righteousness and judgement: for all them that are
oppressed with wrong.
He shewed his ways unto Moses: his works unto the children of Israel.
The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and of great goodness.
He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth he his anger for ever.
He hath not dealt with us after our sins: nor rewarded us according to our
wickednesses.
For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth: so great is his mercy
also toward them that fear him.
Look how wide also the east is from the west: so far hath he set our sins from us.
Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children: even so is the Lord merciful unto
them that fear him.
For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that we are but dust.
The days of man are but as grass: for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.
For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone: and the place thereof shall know
it no more.
But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon them that
fear him: and his righteousness upon children's children;
Even upon such as keep his covenant: and think upon his commandments to do
them.
The Lord hath prepared his seat in heaven: and his kingdom ruleth over all.
O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength: ye that fulfil his
commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words.
O praise the Lord, all ye his hosts: ye servants of his that do his pleasure.
O speak good of the Lord, all ye works of his, in all places of his dominion: praise
thou the Lord, O my soul.

<h3>Psalm 103</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art become exceeding
glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.
Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment: and spreadest out the
heavens like a curtain.
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: and maketh the clouds his
chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.
He maketh his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire.
He laid the foundations of the earth: that it never should move at any time.
Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment: the waters stand in the
hills.
At thy rebuke they flee: at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.
They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath: even unto the
place which thou hast appointed for them.
Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass: neither turn again to
cover the earth.
He sendeth the springs into the rivers: which run among the hills.
All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild asses quench their thirst.
Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation: and sing among the
branches.
He watereth the hills from above: the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
He bringeth forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the service of men;
That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of
man: and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen
man's heart.
The trees of the Lord also are full of sap: even the cedars of Libanus which he
hath planted;
Wherein the birds make their nests: and the fir-trees are a dwelling for the stork.
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats: and so are the stony rocks for the
conies.
He appointed the moon for certain seasons: and the sun knoweth his going down.
Thou makest darkness that it may be night: wherein all the beasts of the forest
do move.
The lions roaring after their prey: do seek their meat from God.
The sun ariseth, and they get them away together: and lay them down in their
dens.
Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour: until the evening.
O Lord, how manifold are thy works: in wisdom hast thou made them all; the
earth is full of thy riches.
So is the great and wide sea also: wherein are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great beasts.
There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan: whom thou hast made to take his
pastime therein.
These wait all upon thee: that thou mayest give them meat in due season.
When thou givest it them they gather it: and when thou openest thy hand they
are filled with good.
When thou hidest thy face they are troubled: when thou takest away their breath
they die, and are turned again to their dust.
When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made: and thou shalt renew
the face of the earth.
The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in
his works.
The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch the hills, they shall
smoke.
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will praise my God while I have my
being.
And so shall my words please him: my joy shall be in the Lord.
As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall
come to an end: praise thou the Lord, O my soul, praise the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 104</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his Name: tell the people what
things he hath done.
O let your songs be of him, and praise him: and let your talking be of all his
wondrous works.
Rejoice in his holy Name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek the Lord and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Remember the marvellous works that he hath done: his wonders, and the
judgements of his mouth.
O ye seed of Abraham his servant: ye children of Jacob his chosen.
He is the Lord our God: his judgements are in all the world.
He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise: that he made to a
thousand generations;
Even the covenant that he made with Abraham: and the oath that he sware unto
Isaac;
And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law: and to Israel for an everlasting
testament;
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan: the lot of your inheritance;
When there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in the land;
What time as they went from one nation to another: from one kingdom to another
people;
He suffered no man to do them wrong: but reproved even kings for their sakes;
Touch not mine Anointed: and do my prophets no harm.
Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land: and destroyed all the provision of
bread.
But he had sent a man before them: even Joseph, who was sold to be a bondservant;
Whose feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his soul;
Until the time came that his cause was known: the word of the Lord tried him.
The king sent, and delivered him: the prince of the people let him go free.
He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his substance;
That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach his senators wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people exceedingly: and made them stronger than their
enemies.
Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people: and dealt untruly with his
servants.
Then sent he Moses his servant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.
And these shewed his tokens among them: and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and it was dark: and they were not obedient unto his word.
He turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs: yea, even in their kings' chambers.
He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies: and lice in all their
quarters.
He gave them hail-stones for rain: and flames of fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and fig-trees: and destroyed the trees that were in
their coasts.
He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable:
and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their
ground.
He smote all the first-born in their land: even the chief of all their strength.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person
among their tribes.
Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were afraid of them.
He spread out a cloud to be a covering: and fire to give light in the night-season.
At their desire he brought quails: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in the
dry places.
For why? he remembered his holy promise: and Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy: and his chosen with gladness.
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people
in possession;
That they might keep his statutes: and observe his laws.

<h3>Psalm 105</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for
ever.
Who can express the noble acts of the Lord: or shew forth all his praise?
Blessed are they that alway keep judgement: and do righteousness.
Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation;
That I may see the felicity of thy chosen: and rejoice in the gladness of thy
people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers: we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly.
Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great
goodness in remembrance: but were disobedient at the sea, even at the
Red sea.
Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake: that he might make his power
to be known.
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the
deep, as through a wilderness.
And he saved them from the adversaries' hand: and delivered them from the
hand of the enemy.
As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them: there was not
one of them left.
Then believed they his words: and sang praise unto him.
But within a while they forgat his works: and would not abide his counsel.
But lust came upon them in the wilderness: and they tempted God in the desert.
And he gave them their desire: and sent leanness withal into their soul.
They angered Moses also in the tents: and Aaron the saint of the Lord.
So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of
Abiram.
And the fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the ungodly.
They made a calf in Horeb: and worshipped the molten image.
Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.
And they forgat God their Saviour: who had done so great things in Egypt;
Wondrous works in the land of Ham: and fearful things by the Red sea.
So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood
before him in the gap: to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should
destroy them.
Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no credence unto his
word;
But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord.
Then lift he up his hand against them: to overthrow them in the wilderness;
To cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves unto Baal-peor: and ate the offerings of the dead.
Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions: and the plague was
great among them.
Then stood up Phinees and prayed: and so the plague ceased.
And that was counted unto him for righteousness: among all posterities for
evermore.
They angered him also at the waters of strife: so that he punished Moses for
their sakes;
Because they provoked his spirit: so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Neither destroyed they the heathen: as the Lord commanded them;
But were mingled among the heathen: and learned their works.
Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay: yea,
they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters:
whom they had offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled
with blood.
Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring with their own
inventions.
Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people: insomuch that
he abhorred his own inheritance.
And he gave them over into the hands of the heathen: and they that hated them
were lords over them.
Their enemies oppressed them: and had them in subjection.
Many a time did he deliver them: but they rebelled against him with their own
inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.
Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity: he heard their complaint.
He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude of
his mercies: yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity
them.
Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen: that we may
give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world without end: and
let all the people say, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 106</h3>
Alleluia
Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed: and delivered from the
hand of the enemy;
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west: from the
north and from the south.
They went astray in the wilderness out of the way: and found no city to dwell in;
Hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.
So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: and he delivered them from their
distress.
He led them forth by the right way: that they might go to the city where they
dwelt.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he satisfieth the empty soul: and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: being fast bound in misery
and iron ;
Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly regarded the
counsel of the most Highest;
He also brought down their heart through heaviness: they fell down, and there
was none to help them.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death: and brake
their bonds in sunder.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he hath broken the gates of brass: and smitten the bars of iron in sunder.
Foolish men are plagued for their offence: and because of their wickedness.
Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they were even hard at death's door.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
He sent his word, and healed them: and they were saved from their destruction.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving: and tell out his
works with gladness!
They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their business in great waters;
These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.
For at his word the stormy wind ariseth: which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep: their soul
melteth away because of the trouble.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are at their wits' end.
So when thy cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivereth them out of their
distress.
For he maketh the storm to cease: so that the waves thereof are still.
Then are they glad, because they are at rest: and so he bringeth them unto the
haven where they would be.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people: and praise him
in the seat of the elders!
Who turneth the floods into a wilderness: and drieth up the water-springs.
A fruitful land maketh he barren: for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water: and water-springs of a dry
ground.
And there he setteth the hungry: that they may build them a city to dwell in.
That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards: to yield them fruits of
increase.
He blesseth them so that they multiply exceedingly: and suffereth not their cattle
to decrease.
And again, when they are minished and brought low: through oppression,
through any plague or trouble;
Though he suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants: and let them wander
out of the way in the wilderness.
Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery: and maketh him households like a flock of
sheep.
The righteous will consider this, and rejoice: and the mouth of all wickedness
shall be stopped.
Whoso is wise will ponder these things: and they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 107</h3>
Song of a psalm by David
O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing and give praise with the
best member that I have.
Awake, thou lute, and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing praises unto
thee among the nations.
For thy mercy is greater than the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
That thy beloved may be delivered: let thy right hand save them, and hear thou
me.
God hath spoken in his holiness: I will rejoice therefore, and divide Sichem, and
mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head.
Judah is my law-giver, Moab is my wash-pot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe,
upon Philistia will I triumph.
Who will lead me into the strong city: and who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou forsaken us, O God: and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our
hosts?
O help us against the enemy: for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do great acts: and it is he that shall tread down our
enemies.
<h3>Psalm 108</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise: for the mouth of the ungodly, yea, the
mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.
And they have spoken against me with false tongues: they compassed me about
also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part: but I give
myself unto prayer.
Thus have they rewarded me evil for good: and hatred for my good will.
Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand.
When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned: and let his prayer be
turned into sin.
Let his days be few: and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless: and his wife a widow.
Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread: let them seek it also out of
desolate places.
Let the extortioner consume all that he hath: and let the stranger spoil his
labour.
Let there be no man to pity him: nor to have compassion upon his fatherless
children.
Let his posterity be destroyed: and in the next generation let his name be clean
put out.
Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight of the Lord:
and let not the sin of his mother be done away.
Let them alway be before the Lord: that he may root out the memorial of them
from off the earth.
And that, because his mind was not to do good: but persecuted the poor helpless
man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.
His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him: he loved not blessing,
therefore shall it be far from him.
He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a raiment: and it shall come into his
bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be unto him as the cloke that he hath upon him: and as the girdle that he is
alway girded withal.
Let it thus happen from the Lord unto mine enemies: and to those that speak evil
against my soul.
But deal thou with me, O Lord God, according unto thy Name: for sweet is thy
mercy.
O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor: and my heart is wounded within me.
I go hence like the shadow that departeth: and am driven away as the
grasshopper.
My knees are weak through fasting: my flesh is dried up for want of fatness.
I became also a reproach unto them: they that looked upon me shaked their
heads.
Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy.
And they shall know, how that this is thy hand: and that thou, Lord, hast done it.
Though they curse, yet bless thou: and let them be confounded that rise up
against me; but let thy servant rejoice.
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame: and let them cover themselves with
their own confusion, as with a cloke.
As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth: and praise him
among the multitude.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor: to save his soul from the
unrighteous judges.

          <p><i class="note">*</i>When all creation beheld Thee crucified, it was changed and trembled: the whole earth shook, quaking, O long-suffering Word; in fear the veil of the temple rent in twain and in terror the rocks split asunder when Thou wast insulted; and the sun, knowing Thee to be its Creator, hid its rays.</p>

<h3>Psalm 134</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, laud ye the Name of the Lord: praise it, O ye servants of the
Lord;
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord: in the courts of the house of our God.
O praise the Lord, for the Lord is gracious: O sing praises unto his Name, for it is
lovely.
For why? the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself: and Israel for his own
possession.
For I know that the Lord is great: and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth: and in the sea,
and in all deep places.
He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world: and sendeth forth
lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his treasures.
He smote the first-born of Egypt: both of man and beast.
He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of Egypt:
upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.
He smote divers nations: and slew mighty kings;
Sehon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Basan: and all the kingdoms of
Canaan;
And gave their land to be an heritage: even an heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever: so doth thy memorial, O Lord, from one
generation to another.
For the Lord will avenge his people: and be gracious unto his servants.
As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold: the work of men's
hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, but they see not.
They have ears, and yet they hear not: neither is there any breath in their
mouths.
They that make them are like unto them: and so are all they that put their trust
in them.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Israel: praise the Lord, ye house of Aaron.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, praise the Lord.
Praised be the Lord out of Sion: who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
<h3>Psalm 135</h3>
Alleluia
O give thanks unto the God of all gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O thank the Lord of all lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who only doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who by his excellent wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who laid out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who hath made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The sun to rule the day: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The moon and the stars to govern the night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote Egypt with their first-born: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever;
With a mighty hand, and stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who divided the Red sea in two parts: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And made Israel to go through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever.
But as for Pharaoh and his host, he overthrew them in the Red sea: for his mercy
endureth for ever.
Who led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Yea, and slew mighty kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Sehon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And Og the king of Basan: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And gave away their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Even for an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who remembered us when we were in trouble: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And hath delivered us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 136</h3>
For David. A psalm of Jeremias
BY THE waters of Babylon we sat down and wept: when we remembered thee, O
Sion.
As for our harps, we hanged them up: upon the trees that are therein.
For they that led us away captive required of us then a song, and melody in our
heaviness: Sing us one of the songs of Sion.
How shall we sing the Lord's song: in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem: let my right hand forget her cunning.
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: yea, if I
prefer not Jerusalem in my mirth.
Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem: how they said,
Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.
O daughter of Babylon , wasted with misery: yea, happy shall he be that
rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us.
Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children: and throweth them against the
stones.

<h3>Psalm 137</h3>
A psalm of David, of Aggæus and Zacharias
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: even before the gods
will I sing praise unto thee.
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of thy
loving-kindness and truth: for thou hast magnified thy Name and thy word
above all things.
When I called upon thee, thou heardest me: and enduedst my soul with much
strength.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they have heard the words
of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: that great is the glory of the Lord.
For though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: as for the
proud, he beholdeth them afar off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me: thou shalt
stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy right
hand shall save me.
The lord shall make good his loving-kindness toward me: yea, thy mercy, O Lord,
endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine own hands.
<h3>Psalm 138</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
O LORD, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou knowest my downsitting and mine up-rising, thou understandest my thoughts long before.
Thou art about my path, and about my bed: and spiest out all my ways.
For lo, there is not a word in my tongue: but thou, O Lord, knowest it altogether.
Thou hast fashioned me behind and before: and laid thine hand upon me.
Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me: I cannot attain unto it.
Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit: or whither shall I go then from thy
presence?
If I climb up into heaven, thou art there: if I go down to hell, thou art there also.
If I take the wings of the morning: and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me.
If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall my night be turned
to day.
Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day:
the darkness and light to thee are both alike.
For my reins are thine: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous
are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.
My bones are not hid from thee: though I be made secretly, and fashioned
beneath in the earth.
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect: and in thy book were all
my members written;
Which day by day were fashioned: when as yet there was none of them.
How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God: O how great is the sum of them!
If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: when I wake up I am
present with thee.
Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God: depart from me, ye blood-thirsty men.
For they speak unrighteously against thee: and thine enemies take thy Name in
vain.
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee: and am not I grieved with those that
rise up against thee?
Yea, I hate them right sore: even as though they were mine enemies.
Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart: prove me, and examine my
thoughts.
Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me: and lead me in the way
everlasting.
<h3>Psalm 139</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
DELIVER me, O Lord, from the evil man: and preserve me from the wicked man.
Who imagine mischief in their hearts: and stir up strife all the day long.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: adders' poison is under their
lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly: preserve me from the wicked
men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.
The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with cords: yea, and
set traps in my way.
I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my prayers, O Lord.
O Lord God, thou strength of my health: thou hast covered my head in the day of
the battle.
Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord: let not his mischievous imagination
prosper, lest they be too proud.
Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them: that compass me
about.
Let hot burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire and into the
pit, that they never rise up again.
A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: evil shall hunt the wicked
person to overthrow him.
Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor: and maintain the cause of the
helpless.
The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name: and the just shall continue in
thy sight.

<h3>Psalm 140</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, I call upon thee, haste thee unto me: and consider my voice when I cry
unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense: and let the lifting up of my
hands be an evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and keep the door of my lips.
O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing: let me not be occupied in
ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, lest I eat of such things
as please them.
Let the righteous rather smite me friendly: and reprove me.
But let not their precious balms break my head: yea, I will pray yet against their
wickedness.
Let their judges be overthrown in stony places: that they may hear my words, for
they are sweet.
Our bones lie scattered before the pit: like as when one breaketh and heweth
wood upon the earth.
But mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust , O cast not out my
soul.
Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me: and from the traps of the
wicked doers.
Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together: and let me ever escape them.
<h3>Psalm 141</h3>
A psalm of instruction for David. When he was in the cave; a prayer
I CRIED unto the Lord with my voice: yea, even unto the Lord did I make my
supplication.
I poured out my complaints before him: and shewed him of my trouble.
When my spirit was in heaviness thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I
walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
I looked also upon my right hand: and saw there was no man that would know
me.
I had no place to flee unto: and no man cared for my soul.
I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said: Thou art my hope, and my portion in the land
of the living.
Consider my complaint: for I am brought very low.
O deliver me from my persecutors: for they are too strong for me.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name: which thing if
thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto my company.
<h3>Psalm 142</h3>
A psalm of David when his son pursued him
HEAR my prayer, O Lord, and consider my desire: hearken unto me for thy truth
and righteousness' sake.
And enter not into judgement with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
living be justified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the
ground: he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have been long
dead.
Therefore is my spirit vexed within me: and my heart within me is desolate.
Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works: yea, I exercise
myself in the works of thy hands.
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.
Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint: hide not thy face from
me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for in thee is my trust:
shew thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I flee unto thee to hide me.
Teach me to do a thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God: let thy loving
Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.
Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name's sake: and for thy righteousness' sake bring
my soul out of trouble.
And of thy goodness slay mine enemies: and destroy all them that vex my soul ;
for I am thy servant.

A psalm of David concerning Goliath
BLESSED be the Lord my strength: who teacheth my hands to war, and my
fingers to fight.
My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in whom I trust:
who subdueth my people that is under me.
Lord, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him: or the son of man, that
thou so regardest him?
Man is like a thing of nought: his time passeth away like a shadow.
Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall
smoke.
Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them: shoot out thine arrows, and consume
them.
Send down thine hand from above: deliver me, and take me out of the great
waters, from the hand of strange children.
Whose mouth talketh of vanity: and their right hand is a right hand of
wickedness.
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: and sing praises unto thee upon a tenstringed lute.
Thou hast given victory unto kings: and hast delivered David thy servant from
the peril of the sword.
Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children: whose mouth talketh
of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.
That our sons may grow up as the young plants: and that our daughters may be
as the polished corners of the temple.
That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of store: that our
sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets.
That our oxen may be strong to labour, that there be no decay: no leading into
captivity, and no complaining in our streets.
Happy are the people that are in such a case: yea, blessed are the people who
have the Lord for their God.
<h3>Psalm 144</h3>
David's Psalm of praise
I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King: and I will praise thy Name for ever and
ever.
Every day will I give thanks unto thee: and praise thy Name for ever and ever.
Great is the Lord, and marvellous worthy to be praised: there is no end of his
greatness.
One generation shall praise thy works unto another: and declare thy power.
As for me, I will be talking of thy worship: thy glory, thy praise, and wondrous
works;
So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts: and I will also tell of
thy greatness.
The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be shewed: and men shall sing of
thy righteousness.
The Lord is gracious and merciful: long-suffering and of great goodness.
The Lord is loving unto every man: and his mercy is over all his works.
All thy works praise thee, O Lord: and thy saints give thanks unto thee.
They shew the glory of thy kingdom: and talk of thy power;
That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom: might be known unto
men.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom: and thy dominion endureth throughout
all ages.
The Lord upholdeth all such as fall: and lifteth up all those that are down.
The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord: and thou givest them their meat in due
season.
Thou openest thine hand: and fillest all things living with plenteousness.
The Lord is righteous in all his ways: and holy in all his works.
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: yea, all such as call upon him
faithfully.
He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will
help them.
The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but scattereth abroad all the
ungodly.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh give thanks unto his
holy Name for ever and ever.

<h3>Psalm 145</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul; while I live will I praise the Lord: yea, as long as I
have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.
O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man: for there is no help in
them.
For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn again to his earth: and then
all his thoughts perish.
Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help: and whose hope is in the
Lord his God;
Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: who keepeth his
promise for ever;
Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong: who feedeth the hungry.
The Lord looseth men out of prison: the Lord giveth sight to the blind.
The Lord helpeth them that are fallen: the Lord careth for the righteous.
The Lord careth for the strangers, he defendeth the fatherless and widow :as for
the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.
The Lord thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore: and throughout all
generations.
<h3>Psalm 146</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God: yea, a
joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: and gather together the out-casts of Israel.
He healeth those that are broken in heart: and giveth medicine to heal their
sickness.
He telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and great is his power: yea, and his wisdom is infinite.
The Lord setteth up the meek: and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground.
O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving: sing praises upon the harp unto our God;
Who covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth: and
maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men;
Who giveth fodder unto the cattle: and feedeth the young ravens that call upon
him.
He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse: neither delighteth he in any
man's legs.
But the Lord's delight is in them that fear him: and put their trust in his mercy.
<h3>Psalm 147</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.
For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates: and hath blessed thy children within
thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: and his word runneth very
swiftly.
He giveth snow like wool: and scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who is able to abide his frost?
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he bloweth with his wind, and the
waters flow.
He sheweth his word unto Jacob: his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with any nation: neither have the heathen knowledge of his
laws.

<h3>Psalm 148</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord of heaven: praise him in the height.
Praise him, all ye angels of his: praise him, all his host.
Praise him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars and light.
Praise him, all ye heavens: and ye waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the Name of the Lord: for he spake the word, and they were
made; he commanded, and they were created.
He hath made them fast for ever and ever: he hath given them a law which shall
not be broken.
Praise the Lord upon earth: ye dragons, and all deeps;
Fire and hail, snow and vapours: wind and storm, fulfilling his word;
Mountains and all hills: fruitful trees and all cedars;
Beasts and all cattle: worms and feathered fowls;
Kings of the earth and all people: princes and all judges of the world;
Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of the Lord: for
his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven and earth.
He shalt exalt the horn of his people; all his saints shall praise him: even the
children of Israel, even the people the serveth him.
<h3>Psalm 149</h3>
Alleluia
O SING unto the Lord a new song: let the congregation of saints praise him.
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: and let the children of Sion be joyful in
their King.
Let them praise his Name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with
tabret and harp.
For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: and helpeth the meek-hearted.
Let the saints be joyful with glory: let them rejoice in their beds.
Let the praises of God be in their mouth: and a two-edged sword in their hands;
To be avenged of the heathen: and to rebuke the people;
To bind their kings in chains: and their nobles with links of iron.
That they may be avenged of them, as it is written: Such honour have all his
saints.
<h3>Psalm 150</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE God in his holiness: praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him in his noble acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.
Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: praise him upon the lute and harp.
Praise him in the cymbals and dances: praise him upon the strings and pipe.
Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: praise him upon the loud cymbals.
Let every thing that hath breath: praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 151</h3>
This psalm is ascribed to David and is outside the number. When he slew Goliath in single
combat.
LITTLE was I among my brethren: a younger brother in my father’s house.
My hands, they made an instrument of music: my fingers, they prepared a
psaltery.
And who shall bring back tidings to my master? The Lord himself, himself gives
ear.
Himself sent forth his messenger: and took me from among my father’s sheep;
and with the oil of his anointing He anointed me.
Comely my brethren were and tall: and yet they found not favor with the Lord.
But I, I sallied forth to meet the alien: and he reviled me by all his idols.
But I drew forth the sword that was beside him: I cut his head off with it, and
from the sons of Israel removed reproach.</div>

O Virgin, preserve thy servants from the every assault of the alien, for thee do I have as protection and help, refuge and confirmation, O Lady; and because of thee I hope to be delivered from the snares of the enemy, O only intercessor for the race of mankind.

O Lover of mankind, Who wilt come to judge all mankind, Thou didst stand condemned, and willingly desired to be crowned with the crown of thorns, O Christ our Savior, uprooting the thorns of disobedience, and delighting all with the knowledge of Thy loving-kindness. O how can the iniquitous ones, darkened by envy, condemn Thee, the righteous and blameless Judge, to the Cross, O Bestower of light?

<h3>Psalm 119</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN I was in trouble I called upon the Lord: and he heard me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitful tongue.
What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue: even mighty
and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.
Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech: and to have my
habitation among the tents of Kedar.
My soul hath long dwelt among them: that are enemies unto peace.
I labour for peace, but when I speak unto them thereof: they make them ready to
battle.
<h3>Psalm 120</h3>
A song of ascents
I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel: shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defence upon thy right hand.
So that the sun shall not burn thee by day: neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even he that shall keep thy
soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from this time forth for
evermore.
<h3>Psalm 121</h3>
A song of ascents
I WAS glad when they said unto me: We will go into the house of the Lord.
Our feet shall stand in thy gates: O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city: that is at unity in itself.
For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord: to testify unto Israel, to
give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.
For there is the seat of judgement: even the seat of the house of David.
O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
Peace be within thy walls: and plenteousness within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions' sakes: I will wish thee prosperity.
Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God: I will seek to do thee good.
<h3>Psalm 122</h3>
A song of ascents
UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as
the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even so our eyes wait
upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are utterly despised.
Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy: and with the
despitefulness of the proud.
<h3>Psalm 123</h3>
A song of ascents
IF THE Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say: if the Lord
himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;
They had swallowed us up quick: when thy were so wrathfully displeased at us.
Yea, the waters had drowned us: and the stream had gone over our soul.
The deep waters of the proud: had gone even over our soul.
But praised be the Lord: who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.
Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler: the snare is
broken, and we are delivered .
Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 124</h3>
A song of ascents
THEY that put their trust in the Lord shall be even as the mount Sion: which may
not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.
The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about his
people, from this time forth for evermore.
For the rod of the ungodly cometh not into the lot of the righteous: lest the
righteous put their hand unto wickedness.
Do well, O Lord: unto those that are good and true of heart.
As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness: the Lord shall lead them
forth with the evil-doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 125</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion: then were we like unto them
that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue with joy.
Then said they among the heathen: The Lord hath done great things for them.
Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already: whereof we rejoice.
Turn our captivity, O Lord: as the rivers in the south.
They that sow in tears: shall reap in joy.
He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed: shall
doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.
<h3>Psalm 126</h3>
A song of ascents
EXCEPT the Lord build the house: their labour is but lost that build it.
Except the Lord keep the city: the watchman waketh but in vain.
It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat
the bread of carefulness: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Lo, children and the fruit of the womb: are an heritage and gift that cometh of
the Lord.
Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant: even so are the young children.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed
when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
<h3>Psalm 127</h3>
A song of ascents
BLESSED are all they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: O well is thee, and happy shalt
thou be.
Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of thine house.
Thy children like the olive-branches: round about thy table.
Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the Lord.
The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shalt see Jerusalem in
prosperity all thy life long.
Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children: and peace upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 128</h3>
A song of ascents
MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up: may Israel now
say.
Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up: but they have not
prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed upon my back: and made long furrows.
But the righteous Lord: hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.
Let them be confounded and turned backward: as many as have evil will at Sion.
Let them be even as the grass growing upon the house-tops: which withereth
afore it be plucked up;
Whereof the mower filleth not his hand: neither he that bindeth up the sheaves
his bosom.
So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord prosper you: we wish you
good luck in the Name of the Lord.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 129</h3>
A song of ascents
OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.
O let thine ears consider well: the voice of my complaint.
If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss: O Lord, who may
abide it?
For there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared.
I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him: in his word is my trust.
My soul fleeth unto the Lord: before the morning watch, I say, before the
morning watch.
O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with him is
plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel: from all his sins.
<h3>Psalm 130</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, I am not high-minded: I have no proud looks.
I do not exercise myself in great matters: which are too high for me.
But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his
mother: yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.
O Israel, trust in the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 131</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, remember David: and all his trouble;
How he sware unto the Lord: and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God of Jacob;
I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house: nor climb up into my bed;
I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eye-lids to slumber: neither the
temples of my head to take any rest;
Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord: an habitation for the mighty
God of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of the same at Ephrata: and found it in the wood.
We will go into his tabernacle: and fall low on our knees before his footstool.
Arise, O Lord, into thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness: and let thy saints sing with
joyfulness.
For thy servant David's sake: turn not away the presence of thine Anointed.
The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David: and he shall not shrink from it;
Of the fruit of thy body: shall I set upon thy seat.
If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall learn them:
their children also shall sit upon thy seat for evermore.
For the Lord hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself: he hath longed for
her.
This shall be my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.
I will bless her victuals with increase: and will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will deck her priests with health: and her saints shall rejoice and sing.
There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: I have ordained a lantern for
mine Anointed.
As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame: but upon himself shall his
crown flourish.
<h3>Psalm 132</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is: brethren, to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down unto the beard:
even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts of his clothing.
Like as the dew of Hermon: which fell upon the hill of Sion.
For there the Lord promised his blessing: and life for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 133</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD now, praise the Lord: all ye servants of the Lord;
Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord: even in the courts of the house of
our God.
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary: and praise the Lord.
The Lord that made heaven and earth: give thee blessing out of Sion.

And she is more  valuable than precious stones: no precious thing is equal to her in value.

Hearken to me, O children, for I will speak solemn truths. Blessed  is the man who shall keep my ways; for my outgoings are the outgoings of life, and in  them is prepared favor from the Lord. Ye, O men, do I exhort; and utter my voice to  the sons of men. I, wisdom, have built up; upon counsel, knowledge and  understanding have I called. Counsel and safety are mine; prudence is mine, and  strength is mine. I love those that love me; they that seek me shall find grace. O ye  simple, understand subtlety, and ye that are untaught, imbibe knowledge. Hearken  unto me again; for I will speak solemn truths. For my throat shall meditate truth; and  false lips are an abomination before me. All the words of my mouth are in  righteousness; there is nothing in them wrong or perverse. They are all evident to  those that understand, and right to those that find knowledge. For I will instruct you  in truth, that your hope may be in the Lord, and ye may be filled with the Spirit </p><h3>THE READING IS FROM THE BOOK OF PROVERBS  </h3><p>The mouth of the righteous droppeth wisdom: but the tongue of the unjust shall  perish. The lips of just men drop grace: but the mouth of the ungodly is perverse.  False balances are an abomination before the Lord: but a just weight is acceptable  unto Him. Wherever pride entereth, there will also disgrace: but the mouth of the  humble doth meditate wisdom. The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the  overthrow of the rebellious shall spoil them. Possessions shall not profit in the day of  wrath, but righteousness will deliver from death. When a just man dieth, he leaveth  regret: but the destruction of the ungodly is speedy and causeth joy. Righteousness  traceth out blameless paths: but ungodliness encountereth unjust dealing. The  righteousness of upright men delivereth them: but transgressors are caught in their  own destruction. At the death of a just man his hope doth not perish: but the boast  of the ungodly perisheth. A righteous man escapeth from a snare, and the ungodly  man is delivered up in his place. In the mouth of ungodly men is a snare for citizens:  but the understanding of righteous men is prosperous. In the prosperity of righteous  men a city prospereth, but at the destruction of the wicked there is exultation. At the  blessing of the upright a city shall be exalted, but by the mouths of ungodly men it is  overthrown. A man void of understanding sneereth at his fellow citizens: but a  sensible man is quiet.  </p><h3>THE READING IS FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON. </h3><p>When the righteous is praised, the people will rejoice; for his memory is  immortality, because it is known with God, and with men; for his soul pleased the  Lord. Love wisdom, therefore, O men, and live; desire her, and ye shall be instructed.  For the beginning of her is love and the observation of the law. Honor wisdom, that  ye may reign for evermore. I will tell you, and will not hide from you the mysteries of  God, for he it is who is the instructor of wisdom, the director of the wise, the master  of all understanding and activity. And wisdom teacheth all understanding; for in her is  a spirit understanding and holy, the brightness of the everlasting light, and the image  of the goodness of God. She maketh friends of God, and prophets; she is more  beautiful than the sun, and above all the constellations of the stars; compared with the  light, she is found pre-eminent. She hath delivered from pain them that please her,  and guided them in right paths, given them knowledge of holy things, defended them  from their enemies, and given them a mighty struggle, that they might all know that  godliness is stronger than all; vice shall never prevail against wisdom, neither shall  judgment pass away without convicting the evil. For they said to themselves,  reasoning unrighteously: Let us oppress the righteous man, let us not spare his  holiness, neither need we be ashamed of the ancient gray hairs of the aged, for our  strength shall be a law unto us; let us lie in wait for the righteous, for he is displeasing  to us, opposeth our doings, upbraideth us with our offending the law, and  denounceth to our infamy the transgressions of our training. He professeth to have  the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the child of the Lord. He is become a  reproof to our thoughts, and is grievous even for us to behold; for his life is not like  other men’s, his ways are of another fashion. We are accounted by him as a mockery,  and he avoideth our ways as filth, and pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed.  Let us see if his words be true; let us test what things happen to him. Let us examine  him with mockery and torture, that we may know his meekness and prove his  forbearance. Let us condemn him with a shameful death, for by his own words shall  he be visited. Such things did they imagine, and were deceived; for their own  wickedness blinded them. As for the mysteries of God, they knew them not; neither  bethought they that Thou alone art God, who hast the power of life and death, savest  in time of tribulation, and deliverest from all evil; who art compassionate and  merciful, givest grace to Thy saints and opposest the prideful with Thine own arm.

<h3>Psalm 109</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool.
The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: be thou ruler, even in the
midst among thine enemies.
In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free-will offerings with an holy
worship: the dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning.
The Lord sware, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech..
The Lord upon thy right hand: shall wound even kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places with the dead bodies:
and smite in sunder the heads over divers countries.
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up his head.
<h3>Psalm 110</h3>
Alleluia
I WILL give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart: secretly among the
faithful, and in the congregation.
The works of the Lord are great: sought out of all of them that have pleasure
therein.
His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour: and his righteousness
endureth for ever.
The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvellous works: that they
ought to be had in remembrance.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he shall ever be mindful of his
covenant.
He hath shewed his people the power of his works: that he may give them the
heritage of the heathen.
The works of his hands are verity and judgement: all his commandments are
true.
They stand fast for ever and ever: and are done in truth and equity.
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever;
holy and reverend is his Name.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all
they that do thereafter; the praise of it endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 111</h3>
Alleluia
BLESSED is the man that feareth the Lord: he hath great delight in his
commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall be
blessed.
Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth
for ever.
Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness: he is merciful, loving, and
righteous.
A good man is merciful, and lendeth: and will guide his words with discretion.
For he shall never be moved: and the righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance.
He will not be afraid of any evil tidings: for his heart standeth fast, and believeth
in the Lord.
His heart is established, and will not shrink: until he see his desire upon his
enemies.
He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor: and his righteousness
remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him: he shall gnash with his teeth,
and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.

<h3>Psalm 112</h3>
Alleluia
PRAISE the Lord, ye servants: O praise the Name of the Lord.
Blessed be the Name of the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
The Lord's Name is praised: from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of
the same.
The Lord is high above all heathen and his glory above the heavens.
Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling so high: and yet
humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?
He taketh up the simple out of the dust: and lifteth the poor out of the mire;
That he may set him with the princes: even with the princes of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house: and to be a joyful mother of
children.
<h3>Psalm 113</h3>
Alleluia
WHEN Israel came out of Egypt: and the house of Jacob from among the strange
people.
Judah was his sanctuary: and Israel his dominion.
The sea saw that, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams: and the little hills like young sheep.
What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest: and thou Jordan, that thou wast
driven back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams: and ye little hills, like young sheep?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the God of
Jacob.
Who turned the hard rock into a standing water: and the flint-stone into a
springing well.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise: for thy
loving mercy and for thy truth's sake.
Wherefore shall the heathen say: Where is now their God?
As for our God, he is in heaven: he hath done whatsoever pleased him.
Their idols are silver and gold: even the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not.
They have ears, and hear not: noses have they and smell not.
They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not: neither speak
they through their throat.
They that make them are like unto them ; and so are all such as put their trust in
them.
But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their succour and defence.
Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
Ye that fear the Lord, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
The Lord hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us: even he shall bless the
house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.
He shall bless them that fear the Lord: both small and great.
The Lord shall increase you more and more: you and your children.
Ye are the blessed of the Lord: who made heaven and earth.
All the whole heavens are the Lord's: the earth hath he given to the children of
men.
The dead praise not thee, O Lord: neither all they that go down into silence.
But we will praise the Lord: from this time forth for evermore. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 114</h3>
Alleluia
I AM well pleased: that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer.
That he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call upon him as long as I
live.
The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of hell gat hold
upon me.
I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I will call upon the Name of the Lord: O
Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea, our God is merciful
The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.
Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul: for the Lord hath rewarded thee.
And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from tears, and my
feet from falling.
I will walk before the Lord: in the land of the living.

<h3>Psalm 115</h3>
Alleluia
I BELIEVED, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled: I said in my
haste, All men are liars.
What reward shall I give unto the Lord: for all the benefits that he hath done
unto me?
I will receive the cup of salvation: and call upon the Name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: right dear in the sight of
the Lord is the death of his saints.
Behold, O Lord, how that I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thine
handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the Name of
the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of all his people: in the courts of
the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 116</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, all ye heathen: praise him, all ye nations.
For his merciful kindness is ever more and more towards us: and the truth of the
Lord endureth for ever. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 117</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: because his mercy endureth for
ever.
Let Israel now confess that he is gracious: and that his mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
Yea, let them now that fear the Lord confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
I called upon the Lord in trouble: and the Lord heard me at large.
The Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man doeth unto me.
The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire
upon mine enemies.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in man.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in princes.
All nations compassed me round about: but in the Name of the Lord will I destroy
them.
They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side: but in the
Name of the Lord will I destroy them.
They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire among the thorns:
for in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.
Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but the Lord was my help.
The Lord is my strength, and my song: and is become my salvation.
The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous: the right hand of
the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass.
The right hand of the Lord hath the pre-eminence: the right hand of the Lord
bringeth mighty things to pass.
I shall not die, but live: and declare the works of the Lord.
The Lord hath chastened and corrected me: but he hath not given me over unto
death.
Open me the gates of righteousness: that I may go into them, and give thanks
unto the Lord.
This is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into it.
I will thank thee, for thou hast heard me: and art become my salvation.
The same stone which the builders refused: is become the head-stone in the
corner.
This is the Lord's doing: and it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath made: we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Help me now, O Lord: O Lord, send us now prosperity.
Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: we have wished you good
luck , ye that are of the house of the Lord.
God is the Lord who hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, yea,
even unto the horns of the altar.
Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: thou art my God, and I will praise thee.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for ever.

They had almost made an end of me upon earth: but I forsook not thy
commandments.
O quicken me after thy loving-kindness: and so shall I keep the testimonies of thy
mouth.
O Lord, thy word: endureth for ever in heaven.
Thy truth also remaineth from one generation to another: thou hast laid the
foundation of the earth, and it abideth.
They continue this day according to thine ordinance: for all things serve thee.
If my delight had not been in thy law: I should have perished in my trouble.

Therefore hold I straight all thy commandments: and all false ways I utterly
abhor.
Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.
When thy word goeth forth: it giveth light and understanding unto the simple.

thy commandments.

        <h3>  THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. JOHN (10, 1-9)  </h3><p>The Lord said unto the Jews who came to Him: Verily, verily, I say unto you, He  that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the  same is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of  the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his  own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep,  he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a  stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of  strangers. This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things  they were which he spake unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily,  I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me are thieves  and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by me if any man enter  in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.   </p>

Elected by the Lord to serve the precious gospel, thou O blessed Father <i class="name">Gregory</i>, nourished thy people with wisdom by thy wise instructions.

By Shedding forth divine sweetness from thy lips, O Father, thou hast banished the bitter drink of godlessness, giving to the thirsting devout the nectar of the knowledge of God, O blessed one.  Predestined by God’s judgment, thou didst appear O Hierarch offering the bloodless sacrifice unto God who offered up Himself for our sake, O Father Hierarch <i class="name">Gregory</i>. The sepulcher, wherein thy precious body lieth, is likened unto a Godly paradise, shedding forth redolent aromas, and filling the faithful with a sweet fragrance, O most glorious and all-honored Hierarch <i class="name">Gregory</i>. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O pure one, the mind of man is incapable of comprehending the unspeakable depths of thy birth-giving, for God humbled Himself for the sake of compassion, and entirely renewed me in thy womb.  </p><p><i class="note">The Sessional Hymn, in Tone IV:</i>  </p><p><i class="note">Spec.

Thou didst teach that God is a Unity undivided and yet known in three Hypostases, not separated nor mingled, thus enlightening the devout with thy sacred theology.  Having first mortified the subtleties of the flesh by abstinence and spiritual labors, thou hast been revealed to be a divine Hierarch and an all-sacred intercessor before the Trinity.  </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The foremothers curse hath been done away with by thee, O Mother of God; for thou, O most pure one, hast brought forth unto us the Source of holiness, the ever-lasting Life.  </p><h3>Ode V</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Illumine with Thy divine light, I pray, O Good One, * the souls of those who with love rise early to pray to Thee, * that they may know Thee, O Word of God, * as the true God, * Who recalleth us from the darkness of sin.

By thy precious instructions those who were enslaved to idolatrous things have become favorites of God, and recalling them from their unworthy ways thou hast become a worthy servant of God Almighty.  Called by grace O holy one, to abolish the lawlessness of idolatry by the sacred waters of Thine instructions, thou hast, by the grace of God, made barren and frozen hearts fertile with the fruits of the spirit.  </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Mary, who knewest not wedlock, thou hast remained a Virgin even after thy strange birth-giving, for it was God Who was born from thee and Who hath ordered all things as He willeth, O Bride of God.  </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Beholding the sea of life surging with the tempest of temptations, * I run to Thy calm haven, and cry to Thee: * Raise up my life from corruption, * O Most Merciful One.

O sacred Father, as one who entered the spiritual holy of holies and there, by the light of the Trinity, learnt things divine, thou hast perfected in spirit the faithful, thyself being most perfect, O Holy Hierarch <i class="name">Gregory</i>.

O sacred Hierarch of the most holy Church, shining with virtuous deeds, the uncreated Trinity made its abode within thee, wherefore thou dost sing: “O God of our fathers, Blessed art Thou”.

        </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the holy martyrs, hierarchs, the venerable & the departed, the </i>acrostic whereof is “I praise with splendor the godly friends of Christ”, the composition of Joseph, in Tone IV: </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Thou who wast born of the Virgin, * drown I implore Thee, in the depth of dispassion * the triune nature of my soul, * as Thou didst the mighty strongholds of the warriors, * that in the mortality of my flesh * as on a timbrel * I may chant a hymn of victory. The honorable Church is ever made splendid by the radiant struggles of the spiritual athletes of the Lord, and rendering worship it glorifies Christ, the Sun Who shone forth from the Virgin and dispelled the darkness of deception. With, faith let us praise the holy hierarchs of Christ, who shepherded well the chosen people; and let us praise the whole assembly of those who lived in holiness and by their spirit mortified the pleasures of the body. Might was given by God to women who by grace trampled down the enemy in fasting and mighty suffering. By the supplications of them and Thy holy prophets, O Lord, send down Thy mercies upon all. For the reposed: O Christ, justify Thy servants whom, in Thy righteous providence, Thou hast taken from this corruptible life unto true life; and, overlooking their transgressions, grant that they may join chorus with all Thy righteous ones. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Delivering us from the primal condemnation, the Son of God became thy Son, O pure one; wherefore, adopted for thy sake, we bless the heavenly Father, hymning thee. </p><p><i class="note">Another canon, of the departed, we chant when there is no Menaion, the acrostic whereof is “A fourth rule: remembering our end”, in Tone IV: </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i></i> Through the deep of the Red Sea, * marched dry shod Israel of old, * and by Moses’ outstretched hands, * raised in the form of a cross, * the power of Amalek was routed in the wilderness. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel. Keep Thy servants at Thy right hand, O Savior, and, entreated by the passion-bearing martyrs, guide them to the pasture of immortality, that they may behold Thy beauty. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Grant rest, O Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants. Overlooking their transgressions, grant, O Christ, that they who have reposed in faith may inherit Thine ineffable and blessed glory; and justify them by grace, through the shedding of Thy blood . Glory ..., By Thy life-bearing death Thou didst slay the slayer, O Christ God. Grant rest now to Thy faithful servants, whom Thou hast received, and to whom Thou givest Thy life. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> When the Son of God, Who is comely in supremely exalted beauties, yet became incarnate from thee, O Virgin, was lifted up upon the Tree, He was bereft of beauty, taking upon Himself death for all. </p><h3>Ode III</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of All Saints </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The bow of the mighty hath waxed feeble * and the weak have girded themselves with strength: * Therefore my heart is established * in the Lord. Slaughtered like lambs, the right victorious martyrs were offered unto Christ, the Lamb and Word of God Who was slain for the deliverance of all. As mouths of God, the initiates of the sacred mysteries brought forth worthy people from among the unworthy, enlightening them with sacred teachings. The company of the venerable have found inexhaustible sustenance through their asceticism, delighting in the sight of divine things and in spiritual ascents. For the reposed: By the intercessions of all Thy saints, O Christ, grant rest unto those who have departed in faith, overlooking all the transgressions they have committed in their life. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> We offer praise unto God Who through the Virgin was born in the flesh, and Who hath united the choirs of women to those of the angels. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Departed </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Not in wisdom, nor in power do we glory, * but we glory in Thee O Christ, * the Hypostatic Wisdom of the Father, * for there is none more holy than Thee, O Lover of mankind. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel. Having triumphed over the deception of idolatry, the martyrs now entreat God the Master, that He grant divine rest unto those who have previously reposed. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Grant rest, O Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants. Be Thou well-pleased to withdraw the flaming sword, O Master, that Thy servants who have reposed may partake of the tree of life. Glory ..., Grant that Thy servants may dwell amid the sustenance of paradise, where the pure voices of those who keep festival are heard, O Christ, granting them remission of their offenses. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thou didst combine virginity with a divine birthgiving, O most pure one; for thou didst ineffably give birth to the Creator of all things, unto Whose will all submit. </p><h3>Ode IV</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of All Saints </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> He who sitteth in glory upon the throne of the Godhead, * Jesus the true God, * is come in a swift cloud * and with His sinless hands he hath saved those who cry: * Glory to Thy power, O Christ.

Possessed of a mind resplendent with immaterial radiance, O godly hierarchs, ye dispelled the night of all delusion, and with true instruction guided the divinely chosen flock of Christ to understanding. The innumerable multitude of the venerable hath been adorned, the sole triumph of divine women hath been magnified, and the holy council of the prophets hath been honored, united, rejoicing, with the councils of the angels For the reposed: Having become fellow citizens with the angels, O holy martyrs, ask remission for all those who have fallen asleep, a dwelling in divine paradise, and ultimate deliverance from transgressions. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> He Who preserved thee a virgin after thine incorrupt birthgiving hath glorified the virgins who stand round about thee.

Possessing Thy Cross as a rod of power, thy servants have passed through the sea of the world, O Lord, and Thou hast caused them to dwell in Thy mountain, wherein Thou didst make Thy sanctuary.

Suspended upon crosses, broken on wheels and dismembered, the mighty martyrs appeared before God wholly intact. As saviors of the faithful, O holy hierarchs, ye brought to the Lamb and Master those who were entrusted to you to shepherd in holiness. Having withdrawn from the tumults of the world, O venerable ones, ye calmed hearts stirred up by the passions, and became children of the God of all. For the reposed: O ye divine prophets, O company of women who were pleasing unto God, ask rest for those who have fallen asleep before us. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> God, Who made His abode within thee, O most pure Virgin, hath made us divine habitations of His glory. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Departed  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel.

O greatly Merciful One, grant unto those who have died before us never-ending life, beauteous joy and unceasing gladness. Glory ..., O only Good One, Source of goodness, grant rest unto those who reached the end of their life in faith and the knowledge of Thee. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> We hymn thee, O Mother of God, through whom the ineffable and unapproachable Light hath shone forth on those in darkness, and we bless thee with love. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of All Saints </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> I have reached the depths of the sea * and the tempest of my many sins hath engulfed me; * but do Thou raise up my life from the abyss * O Greatly-merciful One. Like most costly stones most wisely rolling upon the earth, O martyrs, ye demolished the whole structure of ungodliness and became temples of God. From violent hands ye save all who are under your hands, O holy, righteous and venerable hierarchs, preserving the flock in Christ; wherefore, ye are called blessed. Following the sayings of the prophets, in sufferings and fasting the multitude of women pleased God the Word, Who shone forth from the Virgin.

Let the flaming sword, beholding the spear which pierced Thy divine side, withdraw before Thy servants, O Savior, by the supplications of Thy passion-bearers. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Grant rest, O Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants. Hanging upon the Tree, O my Savior, Thou didst open paradise. In that Thou art compassionate, cause those who have reposed in the faith to dwell therein, and show them to be partakers of Thy life. Glory ..., Grant that those who through death have passed over to Thee in piety, O Master, may delight in the pasture of life, and number them with the righteous of ages past. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Though the Word is invisible God, yet He become visibly incarnate from the Virgin Maiden who knew not a man; and by His death He hath destroyed death. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of All Saints </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Of old the Children of Abraham in Babylon * trampled down the flame of the furnace, * crying aloud with hymns: * O God of our Fathers, blessed art Thou. Together let us in gladness of soul hymn the martyrs of the Lord, the sanctified vessels of Christ the Master, the bulwarks and pillars of the Church. The holy hierarchs of Christ and the divine choir of all the venerable rejoice with the hosts on high. By their supplications, O Christ, save those who hymn Thee. The goodly endurance of the women who shone forth in holiness and suffering and with faith labored in asceticism hath cast down him who infected Eve with disobedience. For the reposed: O Thou Who hast destroyed Hades and trampled down death by Thy death, grant rest to those whom Thou hast taken to Thyself in faith, and cause them to dwell in paradise. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Seeing the flame which did not consume the bush, the law-giver of old was taught an image of thy birthgiving, O ever-blessed Virgin Birthgiver of God. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Departed </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> In the Persian furnace the youths and descendants of Abraham, * burning with a love of piety * rather than by a flame of fire, * cried aloud saying: * Blessed art Thou in the temple of Thy glory, O Lord. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel.

The holy hierarchs, prophets and martyrs, who fought the sacred fight, have received a sacred habitation with the angels, and with them they ask that cleansing and great mercy be given to us all. Enlightened by the Spirit, the venerable ones dispelled the darkness of the demons; and with them the hieromartyrs and holy hierarchs, the prophets and the righteous, glorify God in praise. He who before boasted mindlessly that he would destroy the earth and the sea is ever trampled underfoot by the women who have zealously served God in asceticism and fasting. For the reposed: We beseech Thee on behalf of all who in faith have fallen asleep, O Christ: In that Thou art full of loving kindness, enroll them in the choirs of the saved, who unceasingly cry aloud: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Lady, Birthgiver of God, who hast given birth to the right merciful Word, grant me thy mercy, and save me who cry aloud: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Departed </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Having spread his hands, Daniel closed the lions jaws * in their den; * while the zealously pious youths, * girded with virtue, * quenched the power of the fire and cried aloud: * Bless ye the Lord, all ye works of the Lord. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel.

Having been ordained as bishops for the people and made yourselves radiant through fasting, O holy hierarchs who preached God, ye shone forth more brightly than the sun, illumining the faithful in the manifestation of great deeds, O venerable ones. Let us bless all the venerable and the righteous, the hieromartyrs and all the prophets, and the women who splendidly pleased God, crying aloud: By their supplications, O Christ, deliver our souls from Gehenna!

         <p><i class="note">Stichera of the martyrs, in Tone IV:</i></p> 
</p></p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> Praise Him for His mighty acts, * praise Him according to the 
multitude of His greatness.<p> 
Who is not filled with wonder, O holy martyrs, at beholding the good fight 
that ye have fought? For armed with the Cross and in the body confessing Christ, 
ye defeated the bodiless adversary; wherefore, as is meet, ye have been shown to 
be expellers of demons, and opponents of the barbarians, ever interceding that 
our souls be saved. 
</p></p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> Praise Him with the sound of trumpet, * praise Him with the 
psaltery and harp.<p> 
O holy martyrs, ye have become companions of the angels, bravely preaching 
Christ at the tribunal; for having forsaken all the beautiful things of this world, as 
though they did not exist, ye held fast to the faith as your steadfast hope. 
Wherefore, putting deception to flight, ye pour forth gifts of healing upon the 
faithful, ever interceding that our souls be saved. 
</p></p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> Praise Him with timbrel and dance, * praise him with strings and 
flute.<p> 
How shall we not marvel at your struggles, O holy martyrs? For, clothed in 
mortal bodies, ye vanquished the incorporeal enemies; the threats of tyrants 
roused no fear in you; neither did the infliction of tortures, fill you with fear.  
Therefore, as is meet, ye have been truly glorified by Christ, ask ye great mercy for 
our souls. 
</p></p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> Praise Him with tuneful cymbals, praise Him with cymbals of 
jubilation. * Let every breath praise the Lord.<p> 
Precious is the death of Thy saints, O Lord. Slain by the sword, and by fire 
and freezing cold, they poured forth their blood, placing all their hope in Thee 
that from Thy hand they would receive the reward of their labors. They endured 
to the end and received from Thee O Savior, Thy great mercy. 
 </p><p><i class="note">For the reposed:</i> In a place of rest with Thee, O Lord, where all Thy saints 
repose, grant rest to Thy servants, for Thou alone art the Lover of mankind. 
Glory ..., 
Where is the passionate attraction of the world? Where is the illusion of 
transitory things? Where is the gold and silver? Where are the multitude of 
servants and their clamor? All is dust, all is ashes, all is but a shadow. Come ye, 
and let us cry aloud to Christ Who is immortal: O Lord, grant Thine eternal good 
things unto those who have departed from us, granting them rest in Thy 
blessedness which waxeth not old. 
Now & ever ..., </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i>  
O only pure and most pure Virgin, who hast given birth without seed unto 
God: Pray thou that our souls be saved.

        <p><i class="note">Stichera of the departed, in Tone IV:</i></p></p><p><i class="note">Spec. Mel.: “Thou hast given a sign ...”:</i> 
Truly awesome is the mystery of death. How the soul is separated from the 
body, and this harmony and union is broken, and severed by the will of God. 
Wherefore we entreat Thee: In the dwellings of Thy righteous grant rest to those 
who have departed unto Thee, O Bestower of life, and Lover of mankind. 
</p></p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, O 
Lord.<p> 
For those who believe in Thee, death is but a dream; for when Thou, the 
Master of all, wast laid in the tomb, Thou didst destroy the power of death, 
abolishing its ancient dominion. Wherefore we entreat Thee: Those who have 
departed unto Thee do Thou grant to dwell in the joy of Thy saints and the 
splendor of the just.. 
</p></p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> Their souls * shall dwell among good things.<p> 
Thou hast become our righteousness and sanctification, and the redemption 
of our souls. For Thou didst lead us justified and redeemed unto the Father, 
taking upon Thyself the punishment and debt due from us. And now we entreat 
Thee: Grant rest to the departed in the joy and radiance of Thy saints, O our 
Benefactor and Lover of mankind. 
</p><p>Glory ..., Now & Ever ...,</p><p>
</p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Following, the words of the divinely eloquent prophets, O all-
immaculate One, we believe thee to be the Theotokos. For thou didst ineffably 
give birth to God in the flesh, Who hath delivered us from the bondage of sin. 
Ever beseech Him, that He illumine thy departed servants with the radiance of 
His Light.

        <h3>THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS (7:26-8:2)</h3><p> Brethren: For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, 
separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; Who needeth not daily, as 
those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the 
people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. For the law maketh men 
high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, 
(maketh) the Son, who is consecrated for evermore. Now of the things which we 
have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right 
hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; A minister of the sanctuary, and of 
the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.

<h3>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. JOHN THE DIVINE (10:9-16)</h3><p> Jesus said unto His Disciples: I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall 
be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not, but for to 
steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they 
might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth 
his life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the 
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf 
catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, 
and careth not for the sheep. I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am 
known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay 
down my life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them 
also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one 
shepherd.

<h4>First Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 1</h3>
BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
stood in the way of sinners: and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful.
But his delight is in the law of the Lord: and in his law will he exercise himself
day and night.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side: that will bring forth his
fruit in due season.
His leaf also shall not wither: and look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper.
As for the ungodly, it is not so with them: but they are like the chaff, which the
wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.
Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment: neither the
sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
But the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: and the way of the ungodly shall
perish.
<h3>Psalm 2</h3>
WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why do the people imagine a
vain thing?
The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together: against the
Lord, and against his Anointed.
Let us break their bonds asunder: and cast away their cords from us.
He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: the Lord shall have them
in derision.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath: and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Yet I have set my King: upon my holy hill of Sion.
I will preach the law, whereof the Lord hath said unto me: Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee.
Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance: and the
utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron: and break them in pieces like a
potter's vessel.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be learned, ye that are judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord in fear: and rejoice unto him with reverence.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way: if his wrath
be kindled, (yea, but a little,) blessed are all they that put their trust in
him.
<h3>Psalm 3</h3>
A psalm of David. When he fled from the presence of his son Absalom
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me: many are they that rise against
me.
Many one there be that say of my soul: There is no help for him in his God.
But thou, O Lord, art my defender: thou art my worship, and the lifter up of my
head.
I did call upon the Lord with my voice: and he heard me out of his holy hill.
I laid me down and slept, and rose up again: for the Lord sustained me.
I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people: that have set themselves
against me round about.
Up, Lord, and help me, O my God: for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the
cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 4</h3>
For the end. A song of David among the Psalms
HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast set me at liberty
when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour: and have such
pleasure in vanity, and seek after leasing?
Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that is godly: when
I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart, and in your chamber,
and be still.
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness: and put your trust in the Lord.
There be many that say: Who will shew us any good?
Lord, lift thou up: the light of thy countenance upon us.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart: since the time that their corn and wine and
oil increased.
I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest: for it is thou, Lord, only, that
makest me dwell in safety.
<h3>Psalm 5</h3>
For the end. A song of David concerning her that inherits
PONDER my words, O Lord: consider my meditation
O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King, and my God: for unto thee
will I make my prayer.
My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O Lord: early in the morning will I direct my
prayer unto thee, and will look up.
For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness: neither shall any devil
dwell with thee.
Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest all of them that
work vanity.
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor both the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude of thy
mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies: make thy way
plain before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in his mouth: their inward parts are very wickedness.
Their throat is an open sepulchre: they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own imaginations: cast
them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebelled
against thee.
And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: they shall ever be giving of
thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be
joyful in thee;
For thou, Lord, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous: and with thy favourable
kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
<h3>Psalm 6</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns for the eighth
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy
displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones are
vexed.
My soul also is sore troubled: but, Lord, how long wilt thou punish me?
Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's sake.
For in death no man remembereth thee: and who will give thee thanks in the pit?
I am weary of my groaning; every night wash I my bed: and water my couch with
my tears.
My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of all mine enemies.
Away from me, all ye that work vanity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my
weeping.
The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer.
All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed: they shall be turned back,
and put to shame suddenly.
    </div>
      
        <div>
<h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 7</h3>
A psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the Benjamite
O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all them that
persecute me, and deliver me;
Lest he devour my soul, like a lion, and tear it in pieces: while there is none to
help.
O Lord my God, if I have done any such thing: or if there be any wickedness in
my hands;
If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me: yea, I have delivered
him that without any cause is mine enemy,
Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me: yea, let him tread my life
down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.
Stand up, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignation of
mine enemies: arise up for me in the judgement that thou hast
commanded.
And so shall the congregation of the people come about thee: for their sakes
therefore lift up thyself again.
The Lord shall judge the people; give sentence with me, O Lord: according to my
righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in me.
O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end: but guide thou the just.
For the righteous God: trieth the very hearts and reins.
My help cometh of God: who preserveth them that are true of heart.
God is a righteous Judge, strong and patient: and God is provoked every day.
If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword: he hath bent his bow, and made it
ready.
He hath prepared for him the instruments of death: he ordaineth his arrows
against the persecutors
Behold, he travaileth with mischief: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth
ungodliness.
He hath graven and digged up a pit: and is fallen on himself into the destruction
that he made for other.
For his travail shall come upon his own head: and his wickedness shall fall on his
own pate.
I will give thanks unto the Lord, according to his righteousness: and I will praise
the Name of the Lord most High.
<h3>Psalm 8</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the winepresses
O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world: thou hast set
thy glory above the heavens!
Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength,
because of thine enemies: that thou mightest still the enemy and the
avenger.
For I will consider thy heavens, even the works of thy fingers: the moon and the
stars, which thou hast ordained.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him: and the son of man, that thou visitest
him?
Thou madest him lower than the angels: to crown him with glory and worship.
Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands: and thou hast put
all things in subjection under his feet;
All sheep and oxen: yea, and the beasts of the field;
The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and whatsoever walketh through
the paths of the seas.
O Lord our Governor: how excellent is thy Name in all the world!

<h3>Psalm9</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the secrets of the Son
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will speak of all thy
marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O thou
most Highest.
While mine enemies are driven back: they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in the throne that
judgest right.
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly: thou hast put out
their name for ever and ever.
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: even as the cities which
thou hast destroyed, their memorial is perished with them.
But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath also prepared his seat for judgement.
For he shall judge the world in righteousness: and minister true judgement unto
the people.
The Lord also will be a defence for the oppressed: even a refuge in due time of
trouble.
And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast
never failed them that seek thee.
O praise the Lord which dwelleth in Sion: show the people of his doings.
For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them :and forgetteth
not the complaint of the poor.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider the trouble which I suffer of them that
hate me: thou that liftest me up from the gates of death.
That I may shew all thy praises within the ports of the daughter of Sion: I will
rejoice in thy salvation.
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the same net which they
hid privily, is their foot taken.
The Lord is known to execute judgement: the ungodly is trapped in the work of
his own hands.
The wicked shall be turned into hell: and all the people that forget God.
For the poor shall not always be forgotten: the patient abiding of the meek shall
not perish for ever.
Up, Lord, and let not man have the upper hand: let the heathen be judged in thy
sight.
Put them in fear, O Lord: that the heathen may know themselves to be but men.
Why standest thou so far off, O Lord: and hidest thy face in the needful time of
trouble?
The ungodly for his own lust doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the
crafty wiliness that they have imagined.
For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire: and speaketh good of
the covetous, whom God abhorreth.
The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God ; neither is God in all his
thoughts.
His ways are always grievous: thy judgments are far above out of his sight, and
therefore defieth he all his enemies.
For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down: there shall no
harm happen unto me.
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is ungodliness
and vanity.
He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets: and privily in his lurking
dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.
For he lieth waiting secretly, even as a lion lurketh he in his den: that he may
ravish the poor.
He doth ravish the poor: when he getteth him into his net.
He falleth down, and humbleth himself: that the congregation of the poor may
fall into the hands of his captains.
He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face, and
he will never see it.
Arise, O Lord God, and lift up thine hand: forget not the poor.
Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God: while he doth say in his heart,
Tush, thou God carest not for it.
Surely thou hast seen it: for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong.
That thou mayest take the matter into thy hand: the poor committeth himself
unto thee; for thou art the helper of the friendless.
Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious: take away his ungodliness,
and thou shalt find none.
The Lord is King for ever and ever: and the heathen are perished out of the land.
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the poor: thou preparest their heart, and
thine ear hearkeneth thereto;
To help the fatherless and poor unto their right: that the man of the earth be no
more exalted against them.
<h3>Psalm10</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
IN THE Lord put I my trust: how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a
bird unto the hill?
For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the
quiver: that they may privily shoot at them which are true of heart.
For the foundations will be cast down: and what have the righteous done?
The Lord is in his holy temple: the Lord's seat is in heaven.
His eyes consider the poor: and his eye-lids try the children of men.
The Lord alloweth the righteous: but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in
wickedness, doth his soul abhor.
Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest:
this shall be their portion to drink.
For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness: his countenance will behold the
thing that is just

<h3>Psalm11</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, upon the eighth
HELP me, Lord, for there is not one godly man left: for the faithful are minished
from among the children of men,
They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour: they do but flatter with their
lips, and dissemble in their double heart.
The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips: and the tongue that speaketh proud
things;
Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail: we are they that ought to
speak , who is lord over us?
Now for the comfortless trouble's sake of the needy: and because of the deep
sighing of the poor,
I will up, saith the Lord: and will help every one from him that swelleth against
him, and will set him at rest.
The words of the Lord are pure words: even as the silver, which from the earth is
tried, and purified seven times in the fire.
Thou shalt keep them, O Lord: thou shalt preserve him from this generation for
ever.
The ungodly walk on every side: when they are exalted, the children of men are
put to rebuke.
<h3>Psalm12</h3>
For the end, psalm of David
HOW long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever: how long wilt thou hide thy face
from me?
How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart: how long
shall mine enemies triumph over me?
Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in
death.
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: for if I be cast down, they
that trouble me will rejoice at it.
But my trust is in thy mercy: and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.
I will sing of the Lord, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me: yea, I will
praise the Name of the Lord most Highest.
<h3>Psalm13</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE fool hath said in his heart: There is no God.
They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings: there is none that
doeth good, no not one.
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there
were any that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is none that doeth good, no not one.
Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have they deceived: the
poison of asps is under their lips.
Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood.
Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they not
known ; there is no fear of God before their eyes.
Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief: eating up my
people as it were bread, and call not upon the Lord?
There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was: for God is in the
generation of the righteous.
As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor: because he putteth
his trust in the Lord.
Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turneth the
captivity of his people: then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

<h3>Psalm14</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle: or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?
Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life: and doeth the thing which is right, and
speaketh the truth from his heart.
He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour: and
hath not slandered his neighbour.
He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes: and maketh much of
them that fear the Lord.
He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not: thou it were to
his own hindrance.
He that hath not given his money upon usury: nor taken reward against the
innocent.
Whoso doeth these things: shall never fall.
<h3>Psalm15</h3>
A writing of David
PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee have I put my trust.
O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, my goods are nothing
unto thee.
All my delight is upon the saints, that are in the earth: and upon such as excel in
virtue.
But they that run after another god: shall have great trouble.
Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer: neither make mention of their
names within my lips.
The Lord himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou shalt
maintain my lot.
The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will thank the Lord for giving me warning: my reins also chasten me in the
night-season.
I have set God always before me: for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not
fall.
Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiced: my flesh also shall rest in
hope.
For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell: neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy
One to see corruption.
Thou shalt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is the fulness of joy: and at
thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.
<h3>Psalm16</h3>
A prayer of David
HEAR the right, O Lord, consider my complaint: and hearken unto my prayer,
that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence: and let thine eyes look upon the
thing that is equal.
Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night-season; thou hast tried me,
and shalt find no wickedness in me; for I am utterly purposed that my
mouth shall not offend.
Because of men's works, that are done against the words of thy lips: I have kept
me from the ways of the destroyer.
O hold thou up my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps slip not.
I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: incline thine ear to me,
and hearken unto my words.
Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which
put their trust in thee: from such as resist thy right hand.
Keep me as the apple of an eye: hide me under the shadow of thy wings.
From the ungodly that trouble me: mine enemies compass me round about to
take away my soul.
They are enclosed in their own fat: and their mouth speaketh proud things.
They lie waiting in our way on every side: turning their eyes down to the ground.
Like of a lion that is greedy of his prey: and as it were a lion's whelp. lurking in
secret places.
Up, Lord, disappoint him, and cast him down: deliver my soul from the ungodly,
which is a sword of thine;
From the men of thy hand, O Lord, from the men, I say, and from the evil world:
which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid
treasure.
They have children at their desire: and leave the rest of their substance for their
babes.
But as for me, I will behold thy presence in righteousness: and when I awake up
after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied with it.</div>

<h3>Psalm 17</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David the servant of the Lord. The words which he spoke to the Lord,
even the words of this song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his
enemies, and out of the hand of Saul. And he said:
I WILL love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony rock, and my
defence: my saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust, my
buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.
I will call upon the Lord, which is worthy to be praised: so shall I be safe from
mine enemies.
The sorrows of death compassed me: and the overflowings of ungodliness made
me afraid.
The pains of hell came about me: the snares of death overtook me.
In my trouble I will call upon the Lord: and complain unto my God.
So shall he hear my voice out of his holy temple: and my complaint shall come
before him, it shall enter even into his ears.
The earth trembled and quaked: the very foundations also of the hills shook, and
were removed, because he was wroth.
There went a smoke out in his presence: and a consuming fire out of his mouth,
so that coals were kindled at it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and it was dark under his feet.
He rode upon the cherubim, and did fly: he came flying upon the wings of the
wind.
He made darkness his secret place: his pavilion round about him, with dark
water and thick clouds to cover him.
At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed: hail-stones and coals of
fire.
The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hailstones and coals of fire.
He sent out his arrows, and scattered them: he cast forth lightnings, and
destroyed them.
The springs of water were seen, and the foundations of the round world were
discovered, at thy chiding, O Lord: at the blasting of the breath of thy
displeasure.
He shall send down from on high to fetch me: and shall take me out of many
waters.
He shall deliver from me my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me: for
they are too mighty for me.
They prevented me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my upholder.
He brought me forth also into a place of liberty: he brought me forth even
because he had a favour unto me.
The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing: according to the cleanness
of my hands shall he recompense me.
Because I have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not forsaken my God, as the
wicked doth.
For I have an eye unto all his laws: and will not cast out his commandments from
me.
I was also uncorrupt before him: and eschewed mine own wickedness.
Therefore shall the Lord reward me after my righteous dealing: and according
unto the cleanness of my hands in his eye-sight.
With the holy thou shalt be holy: and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.
With the clean thou shalt be clean: and with the froward thou shalt learn
frowardness.
For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity: and shalt bring down the
high looks of the proud.
Thou also shalt light my candle: the Lord my God shall make my darkness to be
light.
For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men: and with the help of my God I shall
leap over the wall.
The way of God is an undefiled way: the word of the Lord also is tried in the fire;
he is the defender of all them that put their trust in him.
For who is God, but the Lord: or who hath any strength, except our God?
It is God, that girdeth me with strength of war: and maketh my way perfect.
He maketh my feet like harts' feet: and setteth me up on high.
He teacheth mine hands to fight: and mine arms shall break even a bow of steel.
Thou hast given me the defence of my salvation: thy right hand also shall hold
me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.
Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go: that my footsteps shall not
slide.
I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them: neither will I turn again till I
have destroyed them.
I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand: but fall under my feet.
Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou shalt throw done mine
enemies under me.
Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me: and I shall
destroy them that hate me.
They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them: yea, even unto the Lord
shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.
I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I will cast them out as the
clay in the streets.
Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people: and thou shalt make me
the head of the heathen.
A people whom I have not known: shall serve me.
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: but the strange children shall
dissemble with me.
The strange children shall fail: and be afraid out of their prisons.
The Lord liveth, and blessed be my strong helper: and praised be the Lord of my
salvation.
Even the God that seeth that I be avenged: and subdueth the people unto me.
It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine
adversaries: thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.
For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles: and sing
praises unto thy Name.
Great prosperity giveth he unto his King: and showeth loving-kindness unto
David his Anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.

<h3>Psalm 18</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament showeth his
handiwork.
One day telleth another: and one night certifieth another.
There is neither speech nor language: but their voices are heard among them.
Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words into the ends of the world.
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun: which cometh forth as a
bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.
It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the
end of it again: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, converting the soul: the testimony of the
Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: the commandment of
the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever: the judgments of the Lord
are true, and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also
than honey, and the honey-comb.
Moreover, by them is thy servant taught: and in keeping of them there is great
reward.
Who can tell how oft he offendeth: O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.
Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion over
me: so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart: be alway
acceptable in thy sight,
O Lord: my strength, and my redeemer.
<h3>Psalm 19</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the Name of the God of Jacob defend
thee;
Send thee help from the sanctuary: and strengthen thee out of Sion;
Remember all thy offerings: and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
Grant thee thy heart's desire: and fulfil all thy mind.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God:
the Lord perform all thy petitions.
Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Anointed, and will hear him from his holy
heaven: even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.
Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the
Name of the Lord our God.
They are brought down, and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, Lord and hear us, O King of heaven: when we call upon thee.
<h3>Psalm 20</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be of thy
salvation.
Thou hast given him his heart's desire: and hast not denied him the request of
his lips.
For thou shalt prevent him with the blessings of goodness: and shalt set a crown
of pure gold upon his head.
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life: even for ever and ever.
His honour is great in thy salvation: glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon
him.
For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity: and make him glad with the joy of thy
countenance.
And why? because the King putteth his trust in the Lord: and in the mercy of the
most Highest he shall not miscarry.
All thine enemies shall feel thine hand: thy right hand shall find out them that
hate thee.
Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: the Lord shall
destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.
Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth: and their seed from among the
children of men.
For they intended mischief against thee: and imagined such a device as they are
not able to perform.
Therefore shalt thou put them to flight: and the strings of thy bow shalt thou
make ready against the face of them.
Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so we will sing, and praise thy
power.

<h3>Psalm 21</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the morning aid.
MY GOD, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me: and art so far from
my health, and from the words of my complaint?
O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not: and in the night-season
also I take no rest.
And thou continuest holy: O thou worship of Israel.
Our fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them.
They called upon thee, and were holpen: they put their trust in thee, and were
not confounded.
But as for me, I am a worm, and no man: a very scorn of men, and the outcast of
the people.
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot our their lips, and shake their
heads, saying,
He trusted in God, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, if he will have
him.
But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: thou wast my hope, when
I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.
I have been left unto thee ever since I was born: thou art my God, even from my
mother's womb.
O go not from me, for trouble is hard at hand: and there is none to help me.
Many oxen are come about me: fat bulls of Basan close me in on every side.
They gape upon me with their mouths: as it were a ramping and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart also in the
midst of my body is even like melting wax.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my gums: and
thou shalt bring me into the dust of death.
For many dogs are come about me: and the council of the wicked layeth siege
against me.
They pierced my hands and my feet; I may tell all my bones: they stand staring
and looking upon me.
They part my garments among them: and casts lots upon my vesture.
But be not thou far from me, O Lord: thou art my succour, haste thee to help me.
Deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth: thou hast heard me also from among the horns of
the unicorns.
I will declare thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I
praise thee.
O praise the Lord, ye that fear him: magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob, and
fear him, all ye seed of Israel.
For he hath not despised, nor abhorred, the low estate of the poor: he hath not
hid his face from him, but when he called unto him he heard him.
My praise is of thee in the great congregation: my vows will I perform in the
sight of them that fear him.
The poor shall eat and be satisfied: they that seek after the Lord shall praise him;
your heart shall live for ever.
All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned unto the
Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him.
For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the Governor among the people.
All such as be fat upon earth: have eaten and worshipped.
All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him: and no man hath
quickened his own soul.
My seed shall serve him: they shall be counted unto the Lord for a generation.
They shall come, and the heavens shall declare his righteousness: unto a people
that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.
<h3>Psalm 22</h3>
A psalm of David
THE Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside the waters of
comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness, for
his Name's sake.
Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort me.
Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble me: thou hast
anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.
But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
<h3>Psalm 23</h3>
A psalm of David on the first day of the week
THE earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and
they that dwell therein.
For he hath founded it upon the seas: and prepared it upon the floods.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall rise up in his holy place?
Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart: and that hath not lift up his
mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord: and righteousness from the God of
his salvation.
This is the generation of them that seek him: even of them that seek thy face, O
Jacob.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: it is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty
in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: even the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.

rolled away the stone;' * from fear of Him ye became as dead men,' * and calling 
out to the brave Myrrh-bearing women the Angel said: * 'Do ye not see the death 
of the guards, * the breaking of the seals and the emptying of Hades?' * 'Why seek 
ye as a mortal man, * the one who hath destroyed Hades’ victory * and smashed 
death’s sting?' * 'Go quickly and proclaim to the Apostles * the good tidings of the 
Resurrection, crying fearlessly:' * 'He hath risen indeed, ** the Lord who hath 
great mercy!'

<h3>Psalm 24</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my trust in thee: O
let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.
For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed: but such as transgress
without a cause shall be put to confusion.
Shew me thy ways, O Lord: and teach me thy paths.
Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God of my salvation; in
thee hath been my hope all the day long.
Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender mercies: and thy loving-kindnesses,
which have been ever of old.
O remember not the sins and offences of my youth: but according to thy mercy
think thou upon me, O Lord, for thy goodness.
Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Them that are meek shall he guide in judgement: and such as are gentle, them
shall he learn his way.
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth: unto such as keep his covenant
and his testimonies.
For thy Name's sake, O Lord: be merciful unto my sin, for it is great.
What man is he that feareth the Lord: him shall he teach in the way that he shall
choose.
His soul shall dwell at ease: and his seed shall inherit the land.
The secret of the Lord is among them that fear him: and he will show them his
covenant.
Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out of the
net.
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am desolate and in misery.
The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my troubles.
Look upon my adversity and misery: and forgive me all my sin.
Consider mine enemies, how many they are: and they bear a tyrannous hate
against me.
O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be confounded, for I have put my
trust in thee.
Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me: for my hope hath been in
thee.
Deliver Israel, O God: out of all his troubles.
<h3>Psalm 25</h3>
A psalm of David
BE THOU my judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently: my trust hath been
also in the Lord, therefore shall I not fall.
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me: try out my reins and my heart.
For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes: and I will walk in thy truth.
I have not dwelt with vain persons: neither will I have fellowship with the
deceitful.
I have hated the congregation of the wicked: and will not sit among the ungodly.
I will wash my hands in innocency, O Lord: and so will I go to thine altar.
That I may show the voice of thanksgiving: and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house: and the place where thine honour
dwelleth.
O shut not up my soul with the sinners: nor my life with the blood-thirsty.
In whose hands is wickedness: and their right hand is full of gifts.
But as for me, I will walk innocently: O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.
My foot standeth right: I will praise the Lord in the congregations.
<h3>Psalm 26</h3>
A psalm of David before he was anointed
THE Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom then shall I fear: the Lord is the
strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my
flesh: they stumbled and fell.
Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid:
and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.
One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may dwell
in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of
the Lord, and to visit his temple.
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle: yea, in the secret
place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone.
And now shall he lift up mine head: above mine enemies round about me.
Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness: I will sing,
and speak praises unto the Lord.
Hearken unto my voice, O Lord, when I cry unto thee: have mercy upon me, and
hear me.
My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: Thy face, Lord, will I seek.
O hide not thou thy face from me: nor cast thy servant away in displeasure.
Thou hast been my succour: leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me: the Lord taketh me up.
Teach me the way, O Lord: and lead in the right way, because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: for there are false
witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.
I should utterly have fainted: but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the
Lord in the land of the living.
O tarry thou the Lord's leisure: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart ; and
put thou thy trust in the Lord.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 27</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee will I cry, O Lord my strength: think no scorn of me; lest, if thou
make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go down into the
pit.
Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee: when I hold up my
hands towards the mercy-seat of thy holy temple.
O pluck me not away, neither destroy me, with the ungodly and wicked doers:
which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mischief in their
hearts.
Reward them according to their deeds: and according to the wickedness of their
own inventions.
Recompense them after the work of their hands: pay them that they have
deserved.
For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his
hands: therefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.
Praised be the Lord: for he hath heard the voice of my humble petitions.
The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and I am
helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise
him.
The Lord is my strength: and he is the wholesome defence of his Anointed.
O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: feed them , and
set them up for ever.
<h3>Psalm 28</h3>
A psalm of David on the occasion of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle
BRING unto the Lord, O ye mighty, bring young rams unto the Lord: ascribe unto
the Lord worship and strength.
Give the Lord the honour due unto his Name: worship the Lord with holy
worship.
It is the Lord that commandeth the waters: it is the glorious God that maketh the
thunder.
It is the Lord that ruleth the sea; the voice of the Lord is mighty in operation: the
voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar-trees: yea, the Lord breaketh the
cedars of Libanus.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf: Libanus also, and Sirion, like a young
unicorn.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the Lord shaketh
the wilderness: yea, the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Cades.
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and discovereth the
thick bushes: in his temple doth every man speak of his honour.
The Lord sitteth above the water -flood: and the Lord remaineth a King for ever.
The Lord shall give strength unto his people: the Lord shall give his people the
blessing of peace.
<h3>Psalm 29</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song at the dedication of the house of David
I WILL magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up: and not made my foes to
triumph over me.
O Lord my God, I cried unto thee: and thou hast healed me.
Thou, Lord, hast brought my soul out of hell: thou hast kept my life from them
that go down to the pit.
Sing praises unto the Lord, O ye saints of his: and give thanks unto him for a
remembrance of his holiness.
For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his pleasure is life:
heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: thou, Lord, of thy
goodness hast made my hill so strong.
Thou didst turn thy face from me: and I was troubled.
Then cried I unto thee, O Lord: and gat me to my Lord right humbly.
What profit is there in my blood: when I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust give thanks unto thee: or shall it declare thy truth?
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.
Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and
girded me with gladness.
Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing: O my God, I
will give thanks unto thee for ever.

<h3>Psalm 30</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David; an utterance of extreme fear
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion, deliver
me in thy righteousness.
Bow down thine ear to me: make haste to deliver me.
And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence: that thou mayest save me.
For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: be thou also my guide, and lead me
for thy Name's sake.
Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my
strength.
Into thy hands I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou
God of truth.
I have hated them that hold of superstitious vanities: and my trust hath been in
the Lord.
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble, and
hast known my soul in adversities.
Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: but hast set my feet in a
large room.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord , for I am in trouble: and mine eye is consumed for
very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.
For my life is waxen old with heaviness: and my years with mourning.
My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity: and my bones are consumed.
I became a reproof among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours: and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me; and they
that did see me without conveyed themselves from me.
I am clean forgotten, as a dead man out of mind: I am become like a broken
vessel.
For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude: and fear is on every side, while
they conspire together against me, and take their counsel to take away my
life.
But my hope hath been in thee, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my God.
My time is in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies: and from
them that persecute me.
Shew thy servant the light of thy countenance: and save me for thy mercy's sake.
Let me not be confounded, O Lord for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be
put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.
Let the lying lips be put to silence: which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully,
speak against the righteous.
O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee:
and that thou hast prepared for them that put their trust in thee, even
before the sons of men!
Thou shalt hide them privily by thine own presence from the provoking of all
men: thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle from the strife of
tongues.
Thanks be to the Lord: for he hath shewed me marvellous great kindness in a
strong city.
And when I made haste, I said: I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.
Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer: when I cried unto thee.
26.O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth them that are
faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.
Be strong, and he shall establish your heart: all that ye put your trust in the
Lord.
<h3>Psalm 31</h3>
A psalm of instruction by David
BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven: and whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no sin: and in whose spirit
there is no guile.
For while I held my tongue: my bones consumed away through my daily
complaining.
For thy hand is heavy upon me day and night: and my moisture is like the
drought in summer.
I will acknowledge my sin unto thee: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.
I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord: and so thou forgavest the wickedness
of my sin.
For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a time when
thou mayest be found: but in the great water-floods they shall not come
nigh him.
Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shalt preserve me from trouble: thou shalt
compass me about with songs of deliverance.
I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go: and I will
guide thee with mine eyes.
Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding: whose mouths
must be held with bit and bridle. lest they fall upon thee.
Great plagues remain for the ungodly: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord,
mercy embraceth him on every side.
Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord: and be joyful, all ye that are true
of heart.

<h3>Psalm 32</h3>
A psalm of David
REJOICE in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to be thankful.
Praise the Lord with harp: sing praises unto him with the lute, and instrument of
ten strings.
Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing praises lustily unto him with a good
courage.
For the word of the Lord is true: and all his works are faithful.
He loveth righteousness and judgement: the earth is full of the goodness of the
Lord.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the hosts of them by the
breath of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap: and layeth
up the deep, as in a treasure-house.
Let all the earth fear the Lord: stand in awe of him, all ye that dwell in the world.
For he spake, and it was done: he commanded and it stood fast.
The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: and maketh the devices
of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the counsels of princes.
The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever: and the thoughts of his heart from
generation to generation.
Blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord Jehovah: and blessed are the folk,
that he hath chosen to him to be his inheritance.
The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the children of men: from the
habitation of his dwelling he considereth all them that dwell on the earth.
He fashioneth all the hearts of them: and understandeth all their works.
There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host: neither is any
mighty man delivered by much strength.
A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man: neither shall he deliver any
man by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him: and upon them that put
their trust in his mercy.
To deliver their soul from death: and to feed them in the time of dearth.
Our soul hath patiently tarried for the Lord: for he is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in him: because we have hoped in his holy Name.
Let thy merciful kindness, O Lord, be upon us: like as we do put our trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 33</h3>
A psalm of David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech, and he was dismissed
and departed
I WILL alway give thanks unto the Lord: his praise shall ever be in my mouth.
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be
glad.
O praise the Lord with me: and let us magnify his Name together.
I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he delivered me out of all my fear.
They had an eye unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
ashamed.
Lo, the poor crieth, and the Lord heareth him: yea, and saveth him out of all his
troubles.
The angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him: and delivereth
them.
O taste, and see, how gracious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusteth in
him.
O fear the Lord, ye that are his saints: for they that fear him lack nothing.
The lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they who seek the Lord shall want no
manner of thing that is good.
Come, ye children, and hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
What man is he that lusteth to live: and would fain see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil: and thy lips, that they speak no guile.
Eschew evil, and do good: seek peace, and ensue it.
The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous: and his ears are open unto their
prayers.
The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil: to root out the
remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them: and delivereth them out of all
their troubles.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and will save such as be
of an humble spirit.
Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of all.
He keepeth all his bones: so that not one of them is broken.
But misfortune shall slay the ungodly: and they that hate the righteous shall be
desolate.
The Lord delivereth the souls of his servants: and all they that put their trust in
him shall not be destitute.

<h3>Psalm 34</h3>
A psalm of David
PLEAD thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: and fight thou
against them that fight against me.
Lay hand upon the shield and buckler: and stand up to help me.
Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto
my soul, I am thy salvation.
Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seek after my soul :let them be
turned back and brought to confusion, that imagine mischief for me.
Let them be as the dust before the wind: and the angel of the Lord scattering
them.
Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord persecute them.
For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause: yea, even
without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.
Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net, that he hath laid
privily, catch himself: that he may fall into his own mischief.
And, my soul, be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, who deliverest the poor from
him that is too strong for him: yea, the poor, and him that is in misery, from
him that spoileth him?
False witnesses did rise up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
They rewarded me evil for good: to the great discomfort of my soul.
Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with
fasting.: and my prayer shall turn into mine own bosom.
I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother: I went heavily,
as one that mourneth for his mother.
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the
very abjects came together against me unawares, making mouths at me,
and ceased not.
With the flatterers were busy mockers: who gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, how long wilt though look upon this: O deliver my soul from the calamities
which they bring on me, and my darling from the lions.
So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among
much people.
O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly: neither let them
wink with their eyes that they hate me without a cause.
And why? their communing is not for peace; but they imagine deceitful words
against them that are quiet in the land.
They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said: Fie on thee, fie on thee, we
saw it with our eyes.
This thou hast seen, O Lord: hold not thy tongue then, go not far from me, O
Lord.
Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel: avenge thou my cause, my God, and
my Lord.
Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness: and let them not
triumph over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, There, there, so would we have it: neither let
them say, We have devoured him.
Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at my trouble: let
them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that boast themselves against
me.
Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing: yea, let them say
alway, Blessed be the Lord, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
servant.
And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness: and of thy praise
all the day long.
<h3>Psalm 35</h3>
For the end. By David the servant of the Lord
MY HEART sheweth me the wickedness of the ungodly: that there is no fear of
God before his eyes.
For he flattereth himself in his own sight: until his abominable sin be found out.
The words of his mouth are unrighteous, and full of deceit: he hath left off to
behave himself wisely, and to do good.
He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good way:
neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.
Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth unto the heavens: and thy faithfulness unto the
clouds.
Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: thy judgments are like the
great deep.
Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast; How excellent is thy mercy, O God:
and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy
wings.
They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house: and thou shalt give
them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.
For with thee is the well of life: and in thy light shall we see light.
O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee: and thy
righteousness unto them that are true of heart.
O let not the foot of pride come against me: and let not the hand of the ungodly
cast me down.
There are they fallen, all that work wickedness: they are cast down, and shall not
be able to stand.

<h3>Psalm 36</h3>
A psalm of David
FRET not thyself because of the ungodly: neither be thou envious against the
evil-doers.
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass: and be withered even as the
green herb.
Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good: dwell in the land, and verily
thou shalt be fed.
Delight thou in the Lord: and he shall give thee thy heart's desire.
Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him: and he shall bring it to
pass.
He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light ; and thy just dealing as the
noon-day.
Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon him: but grieve not thyself at
him whose way doth prosper, against the man that doeth after evil
counsels.
Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: fret not thyself, else shalt thou be
moved to do evil.
Wicked doers shall be rooted out: and they that patiently abide the Lord, those
shall inherit the land.
Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: thou shalt look after his
place, and he shall be away.
But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth: and shall be refreshed in the
multitude of peace.
The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just: and gnasheth upon him with his
teeth.
The Lord shall laugh him to scorn: for he hath seen that his day is coming.
The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow: to cast down
the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of a right conversation.
Their sword shall go through their own heart: and their bow shall be broken.
A small thing that the righteous hath: is better than great riches of the ungodly.
For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken: and the Lord upholdeth the
righteous.
The Lord knoweth the days of the godly: and their inheritance shall endure for
ever.
They shall not be confounded in the perilous time: and in the days of dearth they
shall have enough.
As for the ungodly, they shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord shall consume
as the fat of lambs: yea, even as the smoke shall they consume away.
The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous is merciful and
liberal.
Such as are blessed of God shall possess the land: and they that are cursed of
him shall be rooted out.
The Lord ordereth a good man's going: and maketh his way acceptable to
himself.
Though he fall, he shall not be cast away: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
hand.
I have been young, and now am old: and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging their bread.
The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth: and his seed is blessed.
Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good: and dwell for evermore.
For the Lord loveth the thing that is right: he forsaketh not his that be godly, but
they are preserved for ever.
The unrighteous shall be punished: as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be
rooted out.
The righteous shall inherit the land: and dwell therein forever.
The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and his tongue will be talking
of judgement.
The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not slide.
The ungodly seeth the righteous: and seeketh occasion to slay him.
The Lord will not leave him in his hand: nor condemn him when he is judged.
Hope thou in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee, that thou
shalt possess the land: when the ungodly shall perish, thou shalt see it.
I myself have seen the ungodly in great power: and flourishing like a green baytree.
I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him, but his place could no where be
found.
Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right: for that shall bring a
man peace at the last.
As for the transgressors, they shall perish together: and the end of the ungodly
is, they shall be rooted out at the last.
But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord: who is also their strength
in the time of trouble.
And the Lord shall stand by them, and save them: he shall deliver them from the
ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him.

<h3>Psalm 37</h3>
A psalm of David . For remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day
PUT me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy heavy
displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me: and thy hand presseth me sore.
There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure: neither is there any
rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.
For my wickednesses are gone over my head: and are like a sore burden, too
heavy for me to bear.
My wounds stink, and are corrupt: through my foolishness.
I am brought into so great trouble and misery: that I go mourning all the day
long.
For my loins are filled with a sore disease: and there is no whole part in my body.
I am feeble, and sore smitten: I have roared for the very disquietness of my
heart.
Lord, thou knowest all my desire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me: and the sight of mine eyes is gone
from me.
My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble: and my
kinsmen stood afar off.
They also that sought after my life laid snares for me: and they that went about
to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit all the day long.
As for me I was like a deaf men, and heard not: and as one that is dumb, who
doth not open his mouth.
I became even as a man that heareth not: and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my
God.
I have required that they, even mine enemies should not triumph over me: for
when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me.
And I, truly, am set in the plague: and my heaviness is ever in my sight.
For I will confess my wickedness: and be sorry for my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are mighty: and they that hate me wrongfully are
many in number.
They also that reward evil for good are against me: because I follow the thing
that good is.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me.
Haste thee to help me: O Lord God of my salvation.
<h3>Psalm 38</h3>
For the end. A song of David, for Idithun
I SAID, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not in my tongue.
I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle: while the ungodly is in my sight.
I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even from good words;
but it was pain and grief to me.
My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire kindled: and at
the last I spake with my tongue;
Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may be certified
how long I have to live.
Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long: and mine age is even as
nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is altogether vanity.
For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth
up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.
And now, Lord, what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.
Deliver me from all mine offences: and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.
I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.
Take thy plague away from me: I am even consumed by the means of thy heavy
hand.
When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to
consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man
therefore is but vanity.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling: hold not thy
peace at my tears.
For I am a stranger with thee: and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence, and be no
more seen
<h3>Psalm 39</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
I WAITED patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and heard my calling.
He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay: and set my
feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth: even a thanksgiving unto our God.
Many shall see it, and fear: and shall put their trust in the Lord.
Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the Lord: and turned not unto the
proud, and to such as go about with lies.
O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like as be
also thy thoughts which are to us-ward: and yet there is no man that
ordereth them unto thee:
If I should declare them, and speak of them: they should be more than I am able
to express.
Sacrifice and meat-offering thou wouldest not: but mine ears hast thou opened.
Burnt-offerings, and sacrifice for sin, hast thou not required: then said I, Lo, I
come,
In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil thy will, O my
God: I am content to do it; yea, thy law is within my heart.
I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I will not refrain
my lips, O Lord, and that thou knowest.
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart: my talk hath been of thy truth
and of thy salvation.
I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth: from the great congregation.
Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord: let thy loving-kindness and thy
truth alway preserve me.
For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such hold upon
me that I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the
hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.
O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me: make haste, O Lord, to help me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after my soul to
destroy it: let them be driven backward and put to rebuke, that wish me
evil.
Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame: that say unto me, Fie upon
thee, fie upon thee.
Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let such as love thy
salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and needy: but the Lord careth for me.
Thou art my helper and redeemer: make no long tarrying, O my God.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 40</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him
in the time of trouble.
The Lord preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth:
and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.
The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick upon his bed: make thou all his bed in
his sickness.
I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies speak evil of me: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: and his heart conceiveth falsehood
within himself, and when he cometh forth he telleth it.
All mine enemies whisper together against me: even against me do they imagine
this evil.
Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him: and now that he lieth, let him
rise up no more.
Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted: who did also eat of my
bread, hath laid great wait for me.
But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord: raise thou me up again, and I shall reward
them.
By this I know thou favourest me: that mine enemy doth not triumph against me.
And when I am in my health, thou upholdest me: and shalt set me before thy face
for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: world without end. Amen.
<h3>Psalm 41</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: when shall I come to
appear before the presence of God?
My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where
is now thy God?
Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the
multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;
In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day.
Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted
within me?
Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his
countenance.
My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore will I remember thee concerning
the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermon.
One deep calleth another, because of the noise of the water-pipes: all thy waves
and storms are gone over me.
The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time: and in the nightseason did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me: why go I
thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword: while mine enemies that trouble
me cast me in the teeth;
Namely, while they say daily unto me: Where is now thy God?
Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.
<h3>Psalm 42</h3>
A psalm of David
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people:
O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.
For thou art the God of my strength, why hast thou put me from thee: and why
go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me: and bring me unto thy
holy hill, and to thy dwelling.
And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and
gladness: and upon the harp I will give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.

<h3>Psalm 43</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
WE HAVE heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us: what thou hast
done in their time of old;
How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted them in: how
thou hast destroyed the nations and cast them out.
For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword: neither was it
their own arm that helped them;
But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance: because
thou hadst a favour unto them.
Thou art my King, O God: send help unto Jacob.
Through thee will we overthrow our enemies: and in thy Name will we tread
them under, that rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow: it is not my sword that shall help me;
But it is thou that savest us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion that
hate us.
We make our boast of God all day long: and will praise thy Name for ever.
But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion: and goest not forth with our
armies.
Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies: so that they which hate us
spoil our goods.
Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep: and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Thou sellest thy people for nought: and takest no money for them.
Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours: to be laughed to scorn, and had
in derision of them that are round about us.
Thou makest us to be a by-word among the heathen: and that the people shake
their heads at us.
My confusion is daily before me: and the shame of my face hath covered me;
For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer: for the enemy and avenger.
And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee: nor behave
ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.
Our heart is not turned back: neither our steps gone out of thy way;
No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons: and covered us with
the shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to any
strange God: shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very secrets of
the heart.
For thy sake also are we killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep
appointed to be slain.
Up, Lord, why sleepest thou: awake, and be not absent from us for ever.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face: and forgettest our misery and trouble?
For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
ground.
Arise, and help us: and deliver us for thy mercy's sake.
<h3>Psalm 44</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses by the sons of Core, for instruction. A Song concerning the
beloved
MY HEART is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the thing which I have made
unto the King.
My tongue is the pen: of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, because God
hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most Mighty: according to thy
worship and renown.
Good luck have thou with thine honour: ride on, because of the word of truth , of
meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible
things.
Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be subdued unto thee: even in
the midst among the King's enemies.
Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, even thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia: out of the ivory palaces,
whereby they have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did
stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, incline thine ear ; forget also thine own
people, and thy father's house.
So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty: for his is thy Lord God, and
worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: like as the rich also among
the people shall make their supplication before thee.
The King's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work: the virgins that be
her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee.
With joy and gladness shall they be brought: and shall enter into the King's
palace.
Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children: whom thou mayest make princes
in all lands.
I will remember thy Name from one generation to another: therefore shall the
people give thanks unto thee, world without end.
<h3>Psalm 45</h3>
For the end. For the sons of Core; a psalm concerning secret things
GOD is our hope and strength: a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved: and though the hills be
carried into the midst of the sea;
Though the waters thereof rage and swell: and though the mountains shake at
the tempest of the same.
The rivers of the flood thereof shall make glad the city of God: the holy place of
the tabernacle of the most Highest.
God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed: God shall help
her, and that right early.
The heathen make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved: but God hath shewed
his voice, and the earth shall melt away.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.
O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord: what destruction he hath
brought upon the earth.
He maketh wars to cease in all the world: he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the
spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.
Be still then, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I
will be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

<h3>Psalm 46</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O CLAP your hand together, all ye people: O sing unto God with the voice of
melody.
For the Lord is high, and to be feared: he is the great King upon all the earth.
He shall subdue the people under us: and the nations under our feet.
He shall choose out an heritage for us: even the worship of Jacob, whom he
loved.
God is gone up with a merry noise: and the Lord with the sound of the trump.
O sing praises, sing praises unto our God: O sing praises, sing praises unto our
King.
For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon his holy seat.
The princes of the people are joined unto the people of the God of Abraham: for
God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the earth, as it were with a
shield.
<h3>Psalm 47</h3>
A psalm of praise for the sons of Core on the second day of the week
GREAT is the Lord, and highly to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his
holy hill.
The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth: upon the north-side
lieth the city of the great King; God is well known in her palaces as a sure
refuge.
For lo, the kings of the earth: are gathered, and gone by together.
They marvelled to see such things: they were astonished, and suddenly cast
down.
Fear came there upon them, and sorrow: as upon a woman in her travail.
Thou shalt break the ships of the sea: through the east wind.
Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the
city of our God: God upholdeth the same for ever.
We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God: in the midst of thy temple.
O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's end: thy right
hand is full of righteousness.
Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad: because of thy
judgements.
Walk about Sion, and go round about her: and tell the towers thereof.
Mark well her bulwarks, set up her houses: that ye may tell them that come
after.
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he shall be our guide unto death.
<h3>Psalm 48</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O HEAR ye this, all ye people: ponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the
world;
High and low, rich and poor: one with another.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom: and my heart shall muse of understanding.
I will incline mine ear to the parable: and shew my dark speech upon the harp.
Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness: and when the wickedness of
my heels compasseth me round about?
There be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches.
But no man may deliver his brother: nor make agreement unto God for him;
For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that alone for ever;
Yea, though he live long: and see not the grave.
For he seeth that wise men also die, and perish together: as well as the ignorant
and foolish, and leave their riches for other.
And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever: and that their
dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the
lands after their own names.
Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour: seeing that he may be compared
unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them.
This is their foolishness: and their posterity praise their saying.
They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and the righteous shall
have domination over them in the morning: their beauty shall consume in
the sepulchre out of their dwelling.
But God hath delivered my soul from the place of hell: for he shall receive me.
Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich: or if the glory of his house be
increased.
For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth: neither shall his pomp
follow him.
For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man: and so long as thou doest
well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.
He shall follow the generation of his fathers: and shall never see light.
Man being in honour hath no understanding: but is compared unto the beasts
that perish.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 49</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
THE Lord, even the most mighty God, hath spoken: and called the world, from
the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Out of Sion hath God appeared: in perfect beauty.
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: there shall go before him a
consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up round about him.
He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth, that he may judge his people.
Gather my saints together unto me: those that have made a covenant with me
with sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is Judge himself.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak: I myself will testify against thee, O Israel;
for I am God, even thy God.
I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt-offerings:
because they were not alway before me.
I will take no bullock out of thine house: nor he-goat out of thy folds.
For all the beasts of the forest are mine: and so are the cattle upon a thousand
hills.
I know all the fowls upon the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are in
my sight.
If I be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the whole world is mine, and all that is
therein.
Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh: and drink the blood of goats?
Offer unto God thanksgiving: and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.
And call upon me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise
me.
But unto the ungodly said God: Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my
covenant in thy mouth;
Whereas thou hatest to be reformed: and has cast my words behind thee?
When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him: and hast been partaker
with the adulterers.
Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness: and with thy tongue thou hast set
forth deceit.
Thou satest, and spakest against thy brother: yea, and hast slandered thine own
mother's son.
These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest
wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and
set before thee the things that thou hast done.
O consider this, ye that forget God: lest I pluck you away, and there be none to
deliver you.
Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation right will I shew the salvation of God.
<h3>Psalm 50</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to
Bathsheba
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according to the
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.
Wash me throughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.
Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin hath my mother conceived me.
But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand
wisdom secretly.
Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice.
Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.
Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health: and
my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.
Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy praise.
For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou delightest not in
burnt-offerings.
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt
thou not despise.
O be favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burntofferings and oblations: then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine
altar.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 51</h3>
For the end. A psalm of instruction by David, when Doeg the Idumean came and told Saul that
David had gone to the house of Abimelech
WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant: that thou canst do mischief;
Whereas the goodness of God: endureth yet daily?
Thy tongue imagineth wickedness: and with lies thou cuttest like a sharp rasor.
Thou hast loved unrighteousness more then goodness: and to talk of lies more
than righteousness.
Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt: O thou false tongue.
Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever: he shall take thee, and pluck thee out
of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of the living.
The righteous also shall see this, and fear: and shall laugh him to scorn;
Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength: but trusted unto the
multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: my trust is in the
tender mercy of God for ever and ever.
I will always give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done: and I will hope in thy
Name, for thy saints like it well.
<h3>Psalm 52</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David upon Maeleth, of instruction
THE foolish body hath said in his heart: There is no God.
Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness: there is none that
doeth good.
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there were any
that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is also none that doeth good, no not one.
Are not they without understanding, that work wickedness: eating up my people
as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.
They were afraid where no fear was: for God hath broken the bones of him that
besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because God hath despised
them.
O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion: O that the Lord would
deliver his people out of captivity!
Then should Jacob rejoice: and Israel should be right glad.
<h3>Psalm 53</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of instruction by David. When the Ziphites came and said to Saul,
Lo, is not David hid with us?
SAVE me, O God, for thy Name's sake: and avenge me in thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God: and hearken unto the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me: and tyrants, which have not God before
their eyes, seek after my soul.
Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy truth.
An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O Lord: because
it is so comfortable.
For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire
upon mine enemies.
<h3>Psalm 54</h3>
For the end. Among hymns of instruction by David
HEAR my prayer, O God: and hide not thyself from my petition.
Take heed unto me, and hear me: how I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed.
The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast: for they are minded to
do me some mischief; so maliciously are they set against me.
My heart is disquieted within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me: and an horrible dread hath
overwhelmed me.
And I said, O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I flee away, and be at
rest.
Lo, then would I get me away far off: and remain in the wilderness.
I would make haste to escape: because of the stormy wind and tempest.
Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them: for I have spied unrighteousness
and strife in the city.
Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow
are in the midst of it.
Wickedness is therein: deceit and guile go not out of their streets.
For it is not an open enemy, that hath done me this dishonour: for then I could
have borne it.
Neither was it mine adversary, that did magnify himself against me: for then
peradventure I would have hid myself from him.
But it was even thou, my companion: my guide, and mine own familiar friend.
We took sweet counsel together: and walked in the house of God as friends.
Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for
wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord shall save me.
In the evening, and morning, and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly: and
he shall hear my voice.
It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
for there were many with me.
Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them down: for
they will not turn, nor fear God.
He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him: and he brake his covenant.
The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart: his
words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very swords.
O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: and shall not suffer
the righteous to fall for ever.
And as for them: thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction.
The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days:
nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.

<h3>Psalm 55</h3>
For the end. Concerning the people that were removed from the sanctuary. By David for a
memorial, when the Philistines caught him in Gath
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me: he is daily
fighting, and troubling me.
Mine enemies are daily in hand to swallow me up: for they be many that fight
against me, O thou most Highest.
Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid: yet put I my trust in thee.
I will praise God, because of his word: I have put my trust in God, and will not
fear what flesh can do unto me.
They daily mistake my words: all that they imagine is to do me evil.
They hold all together, and keep themselves close: and mark my steps, when
they lay wait for my soul.
Shall they escape for their wickedness: thou, O God, in thy displeasure shalt cast
them down.
Thou tellest my flittings; put my tears into thy bottle: are not these things noted
in thy book?
Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight: this I
know; for God is on my side.
In God's word I will rejoice: in the Lord's word will I comfort me.
Yea, in God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows: unto thee will I give thanks.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling: that I may
walk before God in the light of the living.
<h3>Psalm 56</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David, for a memorial. When he fled from the presence of Saul to
the cave
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, be merciful unto me, for my soul trusteth in
thee: and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until this
tyranny be over-past.
I will call unto the most high God: even unto the God that shall perform the
cause which I have in hand.
He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him that would eat
me up.
God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among lions.
And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are
spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they have digged a
pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, and give praise.
Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee
among the nations.
For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens: and thy truth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 57</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation: and do ye judge the
thing that is right, O ye sons of men?
Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth: and your hands deal with
wickedness.
The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb: as soon as they are
born, they go astray, and speak lies.
They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent: even like the deaf adder that
stoppeth her ears.
Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer: charm he never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; smite the jaw-bones of the lions, O
Lord: let them fall away like water that runneth apace; and when they
shoot their arrows let them be rooted out.
Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of a woman:
and let them not see the sun.
Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns: so let indignation vex him, even as a
thing that is raw.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his
footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: doubtless
there is a God that judgeth the earth.

<h3>Psalm 58</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David for a memorial, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill
him
DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God: defend me from them that rise up
against me.
O deliver me from the wicked doers: and save me from the blood-thirsty men.
For lo, they lie waiting for my soul: the mighty men are gathered against me,
without any offence or fault of me, O Lord.
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: arise thou therefore to help
me, and behold.
Stand up, O Lord God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the heathen: and be
not merciful unto them that offend of malicious wickedness.
They go to and fro in the evening: they grin like a dog, and run about through the
city.
Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips: for who doth
hear?
But thou. O Lord, shalt have them in derision: and thou shalt laugh all the
heathen to scorn.
My strength will I ascribe unto thee: for thou art the God of my refuge.
God sheweth me his goodness plenteously: and God shall let me see my desire
upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget it: but scatter them abroad among the
people, and put them down, O Lord, our defence.
For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be taken in
their pride: and why? their preaching is of cursing and lies.
Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish: and know that
it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.
And in the evening they will return: grin like a dog, and will go about the city.
They will run here and there for meat: and grudge if they be not satisfied.
As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betimes in the
morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
trouble.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my
merciful God.
<h3>Psalm 59</h3>
For the end. For them that shall yet be changed. For an inscription by David for instruction.
When he had burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syrian Sobal, and Joab had returned and smitten
twelve thousand in the Valley of Salt
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad: thou hast also been
displeased; O turn thee unto us again.
Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: heal the sores thereof, for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewed thy people heavy things: thou hast given us a drink of deadly
wine.
Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee: that they may triumph because of
the truth.
Therefore were thy beloved delivered: help me with thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Sichem: and mete out
the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head;
Judah is my law-giver.
Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, be thou glad
of me.
Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou cast us out, O God: wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
O be thou our help in trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Through God will we do great acts: for it is he that shall tread down our enemies.
<h3>Psalm 60</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of David
HEAR my crying, O God: give ear unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth will I call unto thee: when my heart is in heaviness.
O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I: for thou hast been my hope, and
a strong tower for me against the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: and my trust shall be under the covering of
thy wings.
For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires: and hast given an heritage unto those
that fear thy Name.
Thou shalt grant the King a long life: that his years may endure throughout all
generations.
He shall dwell before God for ever: O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness,
that they may preserve him.
So will I always sing praise unto thy Name: that I may daily perform my vows.

<h3>Psalm 61</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David for Idithun
MY SOUL truly waiteth still upon God: for of him cometh my salvation.
He verily is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
greatly fall.
How long will ye imagine mischief against every man: ye shall be slain all the
sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and like a broken hedge.
Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt: their delight is in
lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse with their heart.
Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God: for my hope is in him.
He truly is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
fall.
In God is my health, and my glory: the rock of my might, and in God is my trust.
O put your trust in him alway, ye people: pour out your hearts before him, for
God is our hope.
As for the children of men, they are but vanity: the children of men are deceitful
upon the weights, they are altogether lighter than vanity itself.
O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselves unto vanity: if riches
increase, set not your heart upon them.
God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same: that power belongeth
unto God;
And that thou, Lord, art merciful: for thou rewardest every man according to his
work.
<h3>Psalm 62</h3>
A psalm of David. When he was in the wilderness of Idumea
O GOD, thou art my God: early will I seek thee.
My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee: in a barren and dry
land where no water is.
Thus have I looked for thee in holiness: that I might behold thy power and glory.
For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: my lips shall praise thee.
As long as I live will I magnify thee on this manner: and lift up my hands in thy
Name.
My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness: when my
mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.
Have I not remembered thee in my bed: and thought upon thee when I was
waking?
Because thou hast been my helper: therefore under the shadow of thy wings will
I rejoice.
My soul hangeth upon thee: thy right hand hath upholden me.
These also that seek the hurt of my soul: they shall go under the earth.
Let them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be a portion for foxes.
But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him shall be
commended: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
<h3>Psalm 63</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the gathering together of the froward: and from the insurrection of
wicked doers;
Who have whet their tongue like a sword: and shoot out their arrows, even bitter
words;
That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: suddenly do they hit him, and
fear not.
They encourage themselves in mischief: and commune among themselves how
they may lay snares, and say that no man shall see them.
They imagine wickedness, and practise it: that they keep secret among
themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.
But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow: that they shall be
wounded.
Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall insomuch that whoso seeth them
shall laugh them to scorn.
And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done: for they shall perceive that
it is his work.
The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and put his trust in him: and all they that
are true of heart shall be glad.

Thou didst stand between the law and grace, O all-wise one; wherefore, I cry aloud: Have pity on me who am afflicted with wretchedness and am vanquished by the law of sin, O Forerunner. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O most pure one, impassable portal of glory, open unto me the gates of repentance, winning for me divine entry and rest in the life to come. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Even as Thou didst deliver the Prophet from the beast, O Lord, * so do Thou lead me up from the depths * of unrestrained passions, I pray Thee, * that I may dare * to look upon Thy holy temple. Now is the time to change our ways, yet I always lie prostrate, ever stuck in great senselessness. But releasing me from the darkness of my heart, O Word, have pity on me. Have pity on me who groan, as once Thou hadst pity on the publican, O compassionate Christ; and grant that I may weep fervent tears like the harlot, that I also may wash away the filth of my many transgressions </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O great martyrs of Christ, from the great flame in Gehenna, which awaiteth me there, rescue me who have sinned greatly, that I may ever greatly glorify your memory. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having struggled well, Thy passion-bearers were radiantly crowned by Thy life-creating right hand, O Lord and God.

O Forerunner of Christ, with grace illumining me, who am held fast in the sleep of slothfulness, assiduously rouse me to do those things which God willeth. From every tribulation caused by the adversary deliver us who have acquired thee as a divine intercessor and advocate before the Master, O blessed one. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The tempest of sin assails me, O most pure Theotokos.

O all-radiant sun who shinest the radiance of salvation upon me, deliver me from the darkness of the passions which vex my darkened heart. I have acquired an unfruitful soul and a barren heart, O divine offspring of the barren woman. O Baptist of Christ, pray thou without ceasing, that I may produce the fruits of repentance.

Behold, the sores of my soul have putrefied and grown fetid, O Christ, and I have suffered and been humbled thereby; but treat me, O Savior, with the medicines of repentance. By deception the most wicked serpent defrauded me and filled me with evils; but, sighing, I cry: O Word, reject me not, who am condemned and brought low! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye turned not away from a higher standing, O all-praised ones, and ye cast down the enemies of the Cross who sought to undermine you, utterly vanquishing them, O most wise ones. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O all-praised martyrs of the Lord, neither fire, nor the sword, nor wild beasts, nor starvation, nor the crushing wheel, nor any other torture was able to separate you from Christ the Lover of mankind. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Mother of God, boast of angels and salvation of all, be thou a surety for me, that I may find and receive remission of the sins I have committed in the past, in knowledge and in ignorance. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Unto Thee the Fashioner of all, * the children in the furnace chanted a hymn: * All ye works of the Lord, * supremely exalt Him throughout all ages.

Be thou wholly atremble, O my soul, pondering the judgment-seat of the Almighty; and cry aloud: O Compassionate One, for the sake of Thy Forerunner have pity and save me, and deliver me from torments. I move mine unclean lips and defiled tongue in prayer to thee, O holy Forerunner: Hasten thou quickly, and help me, who am unceasingly shaken by all the assaults of the deceiver.

As the true friend of the Master, O all-blessed Baptist, strengthen me to love Him without wavering, and with an upright character, and to spurn the corrupting passions which lead me into the pit of perdition. Thou wast not a reed shaken by contrary winds, O most wise one, but rather our divine confirmation and the unshakable fortification of the Church, which do thou preserve unshaken by thy supplications, causing every temptation to cease. The coming of the Creator is at hand! Why, therefore, dost thou not weep over thyself, O my wretched soul - living in indifference. But arise, and cry out to the Lord: Have pity on me, O Savior, through the supplications of the Fore-runner, in that Thou lovest mankind! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thou hast been shown to be the radiant chariot of the Sun Who shone forth from thy womb and broke the cruel darkness of delusion, O all- immaculate and pure one.

<h3>Psalm 64</h3>
For the end. A psalm and song of David
THOU, O God, art praised in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed in
Jerusalem.
Thou that hearest the prayer: unto thee shall all flesh come.
My misdeeds prevail against me: O be thou merciful unto our sins.
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: he shall dwell
in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house, even of
thy holy temple.
Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation: thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that remain in the broad sea.
Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains: and is girded about with power.
Who stilleth the raging of the sea: and the noise of his waves, and the madness of
the people.
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afraid at thy
tokens: thou that makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
praise thee.
Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very plenteous.
The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest
for the earth.
Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof: thou
makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop fatness.
They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and the little hills shall
rejoice on every side.
The folds shall be full of sheep: the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn,
that they shall laugh and sing.
<h3>Psalm 65</h3>
For the end. A song of a plasm of resurrection
O BE joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of his Name, make
his praise to be glorious.
Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the greatness of
thy power shall thine enemies be found liars unto thee.
For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy Name.
O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is in his doing
toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the water on foot;
there did we rejoice thereof.
He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people: and such as will
not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.
O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to slip.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our loins.
Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water, and
thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay thee my vows, which I
promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of rams: I will offer
bullocks and goats.
O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what he hath
done for my soul.
I called unto him with my mouth: and gave him praises with my tongue.
If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart: the Lord will not hear me.
But God hath heard me: and considered the voice of my prayer.
Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned his mercy from me.
<h3>Psalm 66</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns
GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his countenance,
and be merciful unto us:
That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the folk righteously,
and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God, shall
give us his blessing.
God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 67</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song of David
LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee
before him.
Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away: and like as wax
melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the presence of God.
But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them also be merry and
joyful .
O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name: magnify him that rideth upon
the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise him in his Name JAH, and
rejoice before him.
He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows: even God
in his holy habitation.
He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the
prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates continue in scarceness.
O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through
the wilderness;
The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God: even as Sinai
also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.
Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreshedst it
when it was weary.
Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness
prepared for the poor.
The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers.
Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited: and they of the household
divided the spoil.
Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove: that
is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.
When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake: then were they as white as
snow in Salmon.
As the hill of Basan, so is God's hill: even an high hill, as the hill of Basan.
Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which it pleaseth him to
dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: and the Lord
is among them, as in the holy place of Sinai.
Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for
men: yea, even for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among
them.
Praised be the Lord daily: even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his benefits
upon us.
He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is the Lord, by
whom we escape death.
God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalp of such a one as
goeth on still in his wickedness.
The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan: mine own
will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the tongue of
thy dogs may be red through the same.
It is well seen, O God, how thou goest: how thou, my God and King, goest in the
sanctuary.
The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the damsels
playing with the timbrels.
Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations: from the ground
of the heart.
There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their counsel: the
princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.
Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing, O God, that thou
hast wrought in us,
For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem: so shall kings bring presents unto thee.
When the company of the spear-men, and multitude of the mighty are scattered
abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they humbly bring pieces of
silver: and when he hath scattered the people that delight in war;
Then shall the princes come out of Eqypt: the Morians' land shall soon stretch
our her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord;
Who sitteth in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he doth send out his
voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.
Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel: his worship and strength is in the
clouds.
O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: even the God of Israel, he will give
strength and power unto his people; blessed be God.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 68</h3>
For the end. A Psalm of David for alternate verses
SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.
I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is: I am come into deep waters, so
that the floods run over me.
I am weary of crying; my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for waiting so long
upon my God.
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that
are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.
I paid them the things that I never took: God, thou knowest my simpleness, and
my faults are not hid from thee.
Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my cause:
let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of
Israel.
And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof: shame hath covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an alien unto my mother's
children.
For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me: and the rebukes of them that
rebuked thee are fallen upon me.
I wept, and chastened myself with fasting: and that was turned to my reproof.
I put on sackcloth also: and they jested upon me.
They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs upon
me.
But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.
Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the truth of thy salvation.
Take me out of the mire, that I sink not: O let me be delivered from them that
hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up: and let
not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable: turn thee unto me
according to the multitude of thy mercies.
And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: O haste thee, and
hear me.
Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: O deliver me, because of mine enemies.
Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are
all in thy sight.
Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to
have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.
They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and let the things that
should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.
Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not: and ever bow thou down their backs.
Pour out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold
of them.
Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they talk how they may vex
them whom thou hast wounded.
Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and not come into thy
righteousness.
Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be written among the
righteous.
As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God, shall lift me up.
I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with thanksgiving.
This also shall please the Lord: better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God, and your soul
shall live.
For the Lord heareth the poor: and despiseth not his prisoners.
Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea, and all that moveth therein.
For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah: that men may dwell there,
and have it in possession.
The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his Name
shall dwell therein.
<h3>Psalm 69</h3>
For the end. By David for a remembrance; that the Lord may save me
HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned
backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.
Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame: that cry over me, There,
there.
But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let all such as
delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and in misery: haste thee unto me, O God.
Thou art my helper and my redeemer: O Lord, make no long tarrying.

          <p><i class="note">*</i>Thou wast lifted up like a lamb upon the Cross, and didst lay low the uprisings of the deceiver; and when Thou wast slaughtered Thou didst sanctify the whole earth with Thy blood. Pierced by the spear, Thou didst command the flaming sword to turn away from me, that I might dwell in paradise and partake without fear of the tree of life. Wherefore, saved by Thy sufferings, I cry out, rejoicing: Glory be to Thy divine Cross, whereby we have been delivered from the ancient curse and receive from the Tree blessing and great mercy!</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i>Desiring to bring an end to the pain and afflictions of all, O supremely good Lord my Savior, Thou didst endure vile crucifixion; Thou didst taste of gall, O Innocent One, removing the bitter taste of evil; and wounded, O Word, by the thrust of the spear, Thou healest our wounds, in that Thou art Master. Wherefore, we hymn Thy glorious will, and bowing down, we honor the spear, the sponge and the reed, whereby Thou hast imparted to Thy world peace and great mercy.</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i>“How did the iniquitous multitude of the Jews condemn Thee to be crucified on the Cross, O Jesus, taking no pity on Thee, the Compassionate One?”, exclaimed the Virgin, weeping, when she beheld lifted up upon the Cross Him Who was born from her womb without suffering; “and what hath the iniquitous council done to Thee, O my Child most desired, my most beloved Son? Haste Thou, and save those who glorify Thy crucifixion with faith, and those who magnify me, as Thou didst promise, in that Thou alone art supremely good!” </p>

<h3>Psalm 70</h3>
By David. A psalm sung by the sons of Jonadab and the first that were taken captive
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: but rid
me and deliver me in thy righteousness, incline thine ear unto me, and save
me.
Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may alway resort: thou hast promised to
help me, for thou art my house of defence and my castle.
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the hand of the
unrighteous and cruel man.
For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope, even from
my youth.
Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: thou art he that took
me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall be always of thee.
I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is in thee.
O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy glory and honour
all the day long.
Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength faileth
me.
For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul take their
counsel together, saying: God hath forsaken him; persecute him, and take
him, for there is none to deliver him.
Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me.
Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul: let them be covered
with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.
As for me, I will patiently abide alway: and will praise thee more and more.
My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation: for I know no end
thereof.
I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy
righteousness only.
Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I tell of
thy wondrous works.
Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed: until I have
shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that
are yet for to come.
Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are they that thou hast
done; O God, who is like unto thee?
O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me, and yet didst thou
turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth
again.
Thou hast brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every side.
Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an
instrument of musick: unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Holy One
of Israel.
My lips will be fain when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul whom thou hast
delivered.
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are
confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.
<h3>Psalm 71</h3>
For Solomon
GIVE the King thy judgements, O God: and thy righteousness unto the King's
son.
Then shall he judge thy people according unto right: and defend the poor.
The mountains also shall bring peace: and the little hills righteousness unto the
people.
He shall keep the simple folk by their right: defend the children of the poor, and
punish the wrong-doer.
They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth: from one generation
to another.
He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool: even as the drops that
water the earth.
In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea, and abundance of peace, so long as
the moon endureth.
His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other: and from the flood unto
the world's end.
They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him: his enemies shall lick
the dust.
The kings of Tharsis and of the isles shall give presents: the kings of Arabia and
Saba shall bring gifts.
All kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do him service.
For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth: the needy also, and him that hath
no helper.
He shall be favourable to the simple and needy: and shall preserve the souls of
the poor.
He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong: and dear shall their blood
be in his sight.
He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia: prayer shall be
made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.
There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills: his fruit shall
shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city like grass upon the earth.
His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the
posterities: which shall be blessed through him; and all the heathen shall
praise him.
Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel: which only doeth wondrous
things;
And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: and all the earth shall be filled
with his majesty. Amen, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 72</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
TRULY God is loving unto Israel: even unto such as are of a clean heart.
Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone: my treadings had well-nigh slipt.
And why? I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such
prosperity.
For they are in no peril of death: but are lusty and strong.
They come in no misfortune like other folk: neither are they plagued like other
men.
And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride: and overwhelmed with
cruelty.
Their eyes swell with fatness: and they do even what they lust.
They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy: their talking is against the
most High.
For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their tongue goeth
through the world.
Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no small advantage.
Tush, say they, how should God perceive it: is there knowledge in the most High?
Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in
possession: and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed
mine hands in innocency.
All the day long have I been punished: and chastened every morning.
Yea, and I had almost said even as they: but lo, then I should have condemned
the generation of thy children.
Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me,
Until I went into the sanctuary of God: then understood I the end of these men;
Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places: and castest them down, and
destroyest them.
O how suddenly do they consume: perish, and come to a fearful end!
Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh: so shalt thou make their image to
vanish out of the city.
Thus my heart was grieved: and it went even through my reins.
So foolish was I, and ignorant: even as it were a beast before thee.
Nevertheless, I am alway by thee: for thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel: and after that receive me with glory.
Whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth that I desire in
comparison of thee.
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my
portion for ever.
For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that
commit fornication against thee.
But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord God: and
to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
<h3>Psalm 73</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot
against the sheep of thy pasture?
O think upon thy congregation: whom thou hast purchased and redeemed of old.
Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance: and mount Sion, wherein thou hast
dwelt.
Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy: which hath done
evil in thy sanctuary.
Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations: and set up their
banners for tokens.
He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees: was known to bring it to an
excellent work.
But now they break down all the carved work thereof: with axes and hammers.
They have set fire upon thy holy places: and have defiled the dwelling-place of
thy Name, even unto the ground.
Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether: thus have
they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.
We see not our tokens, there is not one prophet more: no, not one is there among
us, that understandeth any more.
O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour: how long shall the enemy
blaspheme thy Name, for ever?
Why withdrawest thou thy hand: why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy
bosom to consume the enemy?
For God is my King of old: the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself.
Thou didst divide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the
dragons in the waters.
Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces: and gavest him to be meat for the
people in the wilderness.
Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks: thou driedst up
mighty waters.
The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked: and how the foolish
people hath blasphemed thy Name.
O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the enemies: and
forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.
Look upon the covenant: for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel
habitations.
O let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the poor and needy give praise
unto thy Name.
Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
blasphemeth thee daily.
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the presumption of them that hate thee
increaseth ever more and more.

<h3>Psalm 74</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: A psalm of a song for Asaph
UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks: yea, unto thee do we give thanks.
Thy Name also is so nigh: and that do thy wondrous works declare.
When I receive the congregation: I shall judge according unto right.
The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the pillars of it.
I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly: and to the ungodly, Set not up your horn.
Set not up your horn on high: and speak not with a stiff neck.
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west: nor yet from the
south.
And why? God is the Judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixed,
and he poureth out of the same.
As for the dregs thereof: all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and suck
them out.
But I will talk of the God of Jacob: and praise him for ever.
All the horns of the ungodly also will I break: and the horns of the righteous shall
be exalted.
<h3>Psalm 75</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns, a psalm for Asaph: A song for the Assyrian
IN JEWRY is God known: his Name is great in Israel.
At Salem is his tabernacle: and his dwelling in Sion.
There brake he the arrows of the bow: the shield, the sword, and the battle.
Thou art of more honour and might: than the hills of the robbers.
The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep: and all the men whose hands
were mighty have found nothing.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob: both the chariot and horse are fallen.
Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when thou art
angry?
Thou didst cause thy judgement to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled,
and was still;
When God arose to judgement: and to help all the meek upon earth.
The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise: and the fierceness of them shalt
thou refrain.
Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that are round about him:
bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
He shall refrain the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among the kings of the
earth.
<h3>Psalm 76</h3>
For the end. For Idithun, a psalm of Asaph
I WILL cry unto God with my voice: even unto God will I cry with my voice, and
he shall hearken unto me.
In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran and ceased not in the
night-season ; my soul refused comfort.
When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God: when my heart is vexed, I will
complain.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble, that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old: and the years that are past.
I call to remembrance my song: and in the night I commune with mine own
heart, and search out my spirits.
Will the Lord absent himself for ever: and will he be no more intreated?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly to an end for
evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his loving-kindness in
displeasure?
And I said, It is mine own infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right
hand of the most Highest.
I will remember the works of the Lord: and call to mind thy wonders of old time.
I will think also of all thy works: and my talking shall be of thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is holy: who is so great a God as our God?
Thou art the God that doeth wonders: and hast declared thy power among the
people.
Thou hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid: the depths
also were troubled.
The clouds poured out water, the air thundered: and thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: the lightnings shone upon the
ground: the earth was moved, and shook withal.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and thy footsteps are
not known.
Thou leddest thy people like sheep: by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

to shew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he
hath done.
He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law: which he commanded our
forefathers to teach their children;
That their posterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn;
To the intent that when they came up: they might shew their children the same;
That they might put their trust in God: and not to forget the works of God, but to
keep his commandments;
And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation: a
generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not
stedfastly unto God;
Like as the children of Ephraim: who being harnessed, and carrying bows,
turned themselves back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his law;
But forgat what he had done: and the wonderful works that he had shewed for
them.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt:
even in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea, and let them go through: he made the waters to stand on an
heap.
In the day-time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night through with a
light of fire.
He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness: and gave them drink thereof, as it had
been out of the great depth.
He brought waters out of the stony rock: so that it gushed out like the rivers.
Yet for all this they sinned more against him: and provoked the most Highest in
the wilderness.
They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their lust.
They spake against God also, saying: Shall God prepare a table in the
wilderness?
He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
flowed withal: but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?
When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and
there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;
Because they believed not in God: and put not their trust in his help.
So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.
He rained down manna also upon them for to eat: and gave them food from
heaven.
So man did eat angels' food: for he sent them meat enough.
He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven: and through his power he
brought in the south-west-wind.
He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand
of the sea.
He let it fall among their tents: even round about their habitation.
So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire: they were
not disappointed of their lust.
But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon
them, and slew the wealthiest of them: yea, and smote down the chosen
men that were in Israel.
But for all this they sinned yet more: and believed not his wondrous works.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years in trouble.
When he slew them, they sought him: and turned them early, and inquired after
God.
And they remembered that God was their strength: and that the high God was
their redeemer.
Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and dissembled with him
in their tongue.
For their heart was not whole with him: neither continued they stedfast in his
covenant.
But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds: and destroyed them not.
Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not suffer his whole
displeasure to arise.
For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were even a wind that
passeth away, and cometh not again.
Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness: and grieved him in the
desert.
They turned back, and tempted God: and moved the Holy One in Israel.
They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered them from the
hand of the enemy;
How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
He turned their waters into blood: so that they might not drink of the rivers.
He sent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to destroy them.
He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar: and their labour unto the grasshopper.
He destroyed their vines with hail-stones: and their mulberry-trees with the frost.
He smote their cattle also with hail-stones: and their flocks with hot
thunderbolts.
He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure and trouble:
and sent evil angels among them.
He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death: but gave
their life over to the pestilence;
And smote all the first-born in Egypt: the most principal and mightiest in the
dwellings of Ham.
But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep: and carried them in the
wilderness like a flock.
He brought them out safely, that they should not fear: and overwhelmed their
enemies with the sea.
And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary: even to his mountain
which he purchased with his right hand.
He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land to be divided among
them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not his testimonies;
But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers: starting aside like a
broken bow.
For they grieved him with their hill-altars: and provoked him to displeasure with
their images.
When God heard this, he was wroth: and took sore displeasure at Israel.
So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that he had pitched
among men.
He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with his inheritance.
The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not given to
marriage.
Their priests were slain with the sword: and there were no widows to make
lamentation.
So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep: and like a giant refreshed with wine.
He smote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a perpetual shame.
He refused the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
But chose the tribe of Judah: even the hill of Sion which he loved.
And there he built his temple on high: and laid the foundation of it like the
ground which he hath made continually.
He chose David also his servant: and took him away from the sheep-folds.
As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him: that he might
feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
So he fed them with a faithful and true heart: and ruled them prudently with all
his power.

<h3>Psalm 78</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they
defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the
air: and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.
Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem: and there was
no man to bury them.
We are become an open shame to our enemies: a very scorn and derision unto
them that are round about us.
Lord, how long wilt thou be angry: shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?
Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee: and upon
the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.
For they have devoured Jacob: and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon: for we are
come to great misery.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: O deliver us, and be
merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake.
Wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?
O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed: be openly shewed upon
the heathen in our sight.
O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to the
greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die.
And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee: reward
thou them , O Lord, seven-fold into their bosom.
So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for
ever: and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to
generation.
<h3>Psalm 79</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses. A testimony for Asaph: a Psalm concerning the Assyrian
HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep: shew
thyself also, thou that sittest upon the cherubims.
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses: stir up thy strength, and come, and
help us.
Turn us again, O God: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
O Lord God of hosts: how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears: and givest them plenteousness of
tears to drink.
Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh us
to scorn.
Turn us again, thou God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall
be whole.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and
planted it.
Thou madest room for it: and when it had taken root it filled the land.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it: and the boughs thereof were like
the goodly cedar-trees.
She stretched out her branches unto the sea: and her boughs unto the river.
Why hast thou then broken down her hedge: that all they that go by pluck off her
grapes?
The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up: and the wild beasts of the field
devour it.
Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven: behold, and visit this
vine;
And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted: and the branch
that thou madest so strong for thyself.
It is burnt with fire, and cut down: and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy
countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man, whom
thou madest so strong for thine own self.
And so will not we go back from thee: O let us live, and we shall call upon thy
Name.
Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.
<h3>Psalm 80</h3>
For the end. A psalm for Asaph, concerning the winepresses
SING we merrily unto God our strength: make a cheerful noise unto the God of
Jacob.
Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret: the merry harp with the lute.
Blow up the trumpet in the new-moon: even in the time appointed, and upon our
solemn feast-day.
For this was made a statute for Israel: and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony: when he came out of the land of
Egypt, and had heard a strange language.
I eased his shoulder from the burden: and his hands were delivered from making
the pots.
Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee: and heard thee what
time as the storm fell upon thee.
I proved thee also: at the waters of strife.
Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel: if thou wilt hearken unto me,
There shall no strange god be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any other god.
I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy
mouth wide, and I shall fill it.
But my people would not hear my voice: and Israel would not obey me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts: and let them follow their own
imaginations.
O that my people would have hearkened unto me: for if Israel had walked in my
ways,
I should soon have put down their enemies: and turned my hand against their
adversaries.
The haters of the Lord should have been found liars: but their time should have
endured for ever.
He should have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour: and with honey out of
the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

<h3>Psalm 81</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
GOD standeth in the congregation of princes: he is a Judge among gods.
How long will ye give wrong judgement: and accept the persons of the ungodly?
Defend the poor and fatherless: see that such as are in need and necessity have
right.
Deliver the outcast and poor: save them from the hand of the ungodly.
They will not be learned nor understand, but walk on still in darkness: all the
foundations of the earth are out of course.
I have said, Ye are gods: and ye are all the children of the most Highest.
But ye shall die like men: and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth: for thou shalt take all heathen to thine
inheritance.
<h3>Psalm 82</h3>
A song of a psalm for Asaph
HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: refrain not thyself, O God.
For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring: and they that hate thee have lift up
their head.
They have imagined craftily against thy people: and taken counsel against thy
secret ones.
They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people:
and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
For they have cast their heads together with one consent: and are confederate
against thee;
The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismaelites: the Moabites and
Hagarenes;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek: the Philistines, with them that dwell at Tyre.
Assur also is joined with them: and have holpen the children of Lot.
But do thou to them as unto the Madianites: unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the
brook of Kison;
Who perished at Endor: and became as the dung of the earth.
Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeb: yea, make all their princes like
as Zeba and Salmana;
Who say, Let us take to ourselves: the houses of God in possession.
O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and as the stubble before the wind;
Like as the fire that burneth up the wood: and as the flame that consumeth the
mountains.
Persecute them even so with thy tempest: and make them afraid with thy storm.
Make their faces ashamed, O Lord: that they may seek thy Name.
Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more: let them be put to
shame, and perish.
And they shall know that thou, whose Name is Jehovah: art only the most Highest
over all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 83</h3>
For the end. A song for the sons of Core, concerning the winepresses
O HOW amiable are thy dwellings: thou Lord of hosts!
My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the Lord: my heart
and my flesh rejoice in the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest where she may
lay her young: even thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be alway praising thee.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are thy ways.
Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well: and the pools are filled
with water.
They will go from strength to strength: and unto the God of gods appeareth every
one of them in Sion.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer :hearken, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our defender: and look upon the face of thine Anointed.
For one day in thy courts: is better than a thousand.
I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God: than to dwell in the tents
of ungodliness.
For the Lord God is a light and defence: the Lord will give grace and worship,
and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a godly life.
O Lord God of hosts: blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 84</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou hast turned away the
captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people: and covered all their sins.
Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure: and turned thyself from thy wrathful
indignation.
Turn us then, O God our Saviour: and let thine anger cease from us.
Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever: and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from
one generation to another?
Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Shew us thy mercy, O Lord: and grant us thy salvation.
I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak
peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again.
For his salvation is nigh them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each
other.
Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness hath looked down from
heaven.
Yea, the Lord shall shew loving-kindness: and our land shall give her increase.
Righteousness shall go before him: and he shall direct his going in the way.

O Virgin who lent Christ flesh from thy blood, wholly wash away my carnal passions, and show me the way of dispassion. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Calm the raging sea of the passions, * O Master Christ, * with its soul-destroying tempest, * and lead me up from corruption * in that Thou art compassionate. Thou wast lifted up upon the Tree, O Long-suffering One, putting down all the uprisings of the enemy, and in Thy surpassing goodness saving me who have fallen. No sooner did the souls of the righteous sense Thee surrendering Thy soul upon the Tree of old, O Word and Master, than they were released from everlasting bonds. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Like hard diamonds ye endured all the burning of torments with patience, and, humbled, ye cast down the enemy. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> As emulators of the sufferings of Christ, ye endured every torture, O passion-bearers of the Lord; wherefore, ye have been deemed worthy of the beauties of heaven. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Wondrous is thine Offspring, Who worketh great miracles and is glorious in His saints, O Lady Theotokos, who alone art all-wondrous. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing.

O all-pure and compassionate Lady, who gave birth to our blessed Benefactor and Fashioner, do thou bless my wicked soul.

To the holy Word Who sanctifieth the faithful didst thou ineffably give birth, O pure one. Him do thou entreat, O all-holy one, that He now sanctify my lowly soul which hath been defiled by evil. The Lord of all, the Torrent of light and Wellspring of immortality, issued forth from thee, O holy Lady; wherefore, I cry to thee, O pure one: With the showers of thy prayers dry up the streams of mine evils.

O pure one, cause me to walk, unerringly and without being led astray, the path of the humility of the precepts of God, driving far from me the turmoil of the demons and the assaults of the passions, and granting me tranquility. The enemy, seeing me stuck fast in the slumber of indifference, mightily attacks me, hoping to carry me off by pleasurable dreams; but do thou thyself preserve me by thy tireless supplication, O pure Virgin Mother. As one self-condemned I ponder the multitude of my sins and the dread tribunal of the Judge, at which I must needs be tried. But as she who gave birth unto God the Judge, O Theotokos, preserve me uncondemned at that time.

<h3>Psalm 85</h3>
A prayer of David
BOW down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor, and in misery.
Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: my God, save thy servant that putteth his
trust in thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I will call daily upon thee.
Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, art good and gracious: and of great mercy unto all them that call
upon thee.
Give ear, Lord, unto my prayer: and ponder the voice of my humble desires.
In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou hearest me.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord: there is not one that can do
as thou doest.
All nations whom thou hadst made shall come and worship thee, O Lord: and
shall glorify thy Name.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in thy truth: O knit my heart unto
thee, that I may fear thy Name.
I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and will praise thy Name for
evermore.
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the
nethermost hell.
O God, the proud are risen against me: and the congregations of naughty men
have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.
But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, plenteous
in goodness and truth.
O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength unto thy
servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.
Shew some token upon me for good, that they who hate me may see it and be
ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
<h3>Psalm 86</h3>
A psalm of a song for the sons of Core
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loveth the gates of Sion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Very excellent things are spoken of thee: thou city of God.
I will think upon Rahab and Babylon: with them that know me.
Behold ye the Philistines also: and they of Tyre, with the Morians; lo, there was
he born.
And of Sion it shall be reported that he was born in her: and the most High shall
stablish her.
The Lord shall rehearse it when he writeth up the people: that he was born
there.
The singers also and trumpeters shall he rehearse: All my fresh springs shall be
in thee.
<h3>Psalm 87</h3>
A song of a psalm for the sons of Core. For the end. Upon Maeleth, for responsive strains.
Concerning instruction for Æman the Israelite
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: O let my
prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling.
For my soul is full of trouble: and my life draweth nigh unto hell.
I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit: and I have been even as a
man that hath no strength.
Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded, and lie in the grave: who
are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit: in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
Thine indignation lieth hard upon me: and thou hast vexed me with all thy
storms.
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me: and made me to be
abhorred of them.
I am so fast in prison: that I cannot get forth.
My sight faileth for very trouble: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have
stretched forth my hands unto thee.
Dost thou shew wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise up again, and
praise thee?
Shall thy loving-kindness be shewed in the grave: or thy faithfulness in
destruction?
Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy righteousness in the
land where all things are forgotten?
Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come before thee.
Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face from me?
I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die: even from my youth
up thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me: and the fear of thee hath undone me.
They came round about me daily like water: and compassed me together on
every side.
My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me: and hid mine acquaintance
out of my sight.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 88</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Ætham the Israelite
MY SONG shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the Lord: with my mouth will I
ever be shewing thy truth from one generation to another.
For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever: thy truth shalt thou stablish in the
heavens.
I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn unto David my servant;
Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne from one generation to
another.
O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and thy truth in the
congregation of the saints.
For who is he among the clouds: that shall be compared unto the Lord?
And what is he among the gods: that shall be like unto the Lord?
God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints: and to be had in
reverence of all them that are round about him.
O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee: thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on
every side.
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.
Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it: thou hast scattered thine enemies
abroad with thy mighty arm.
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast laid the foundation of
the round world, and all that therein is.
Thou hast made the north and the south: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy
Name.
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat: mercy and truth shall go
before thy face.
Blessed is the people, O Lord, that can rejoice in thee: they shall walk in the light
of thy countenance.
Their delight shall be daily in thy Name: and in thy righteousness shall they
make their boast.
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy loving-kindness thou shalt lift
up our horns.
For the Lord is our defence: the Holy One of Israel is our King.
Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help
upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
I have found David my servant: with my holy oil have I anointed him.
My hand shall hold him fast: and my arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not be able to do him violence: the son of wickedness shall not
hurt him.
I will smite down his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.
My truth also and my mercy shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be
exalted.
I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand in the floods.
He shall call me, Thou art my Father: my God, and my strong salvation.
And I will make him my first-born: higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast with
him.
His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the days of
heaven.
But if his children forsake my law: and walk not in my judgements;
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I will visit their
offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.
Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my
truth to fail.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: I
have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David.
His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the sun before me.
He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the faithful witness in
heaven.
But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed: and art displeased at him.
Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his crown to the ground.
Thou hast overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong holds.
All they that go by spoil him: and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all his adversaries to
rejoice.
Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword: and givest him not victory in the
battle.
Thou hast put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: and covered him with dishonour.
Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever: and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
O remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men for
nought?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death: and shall he deliver his soul
from the hand of hell?
Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses: which thou swarest unto David in thy
truth?
Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I do bear in my
bosom the rebukes of many people.
Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of
thine Anointed: Praised be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 89</h3>
A prayer of Moses the man of God
LORD, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of
men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a
watch in the night.
As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut down,
dried up and withered.
For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance.
For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our years to an end, as
it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong
that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but labour and
sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.
But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man feareth,
so is thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be glad all the
days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us: and for the years
wherein we have suffered adversity.
Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou the work
of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handywork.
<h3>Psalm 90</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the most High: shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty..
I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my strong hold: my God, in him
will I trust.
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome
pestilence.
He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers:
his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by
day;
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness that destroyeth
in the noon-day.
A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall
not come nigh thee.
Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold: and see the reward of the ungodly.
For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of defence very high.
There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou
tread under thy feet.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him
up, because he hath known my Name.
He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble; I will
deliver him, and bring him to honour.
With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation.

        <p><i class="note">Theotokion</i><br />O strange, awesome and great mystery! * The Un-circumscribable One hath made His abode within a womb, * and a Mother remaineth a Virgin even after birthgiving, * for from her she gave birth to God Incarnate. * To Him, then, let us cry aloud, * to Him let us raise a hymn, * chanting with the angels: * Holy art Thou, O Christ God, * Who wast incarnate for our sake! ** Glory be to Thee!</p>

<h3>Psalm 91</h3>
A psalm of a song for the Sabbath-day
IT IS a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy
Name, O most Highest.
To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning: and of thy truth in the nightseason.
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute: upon a loud instrument,
and upon the harp.
For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works: and I will rejoice in giving
praise for the operations of thy hands.
O Lord, how glorious are thy works: thy thoughts are very deep.
An unwise man doth not well consider this: and a fool doth not understand it.
When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish: then shall they be destroyed for ever; but thou,
Lord, art the most Highest for evermore.
For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, lo, thine enemies shall perish: and all the workers
of wickedness shall be destroyed.
But mine horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn: for I am anointed with
fresh oil.
Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies: and mine ear shall hear his
desire of the wicked that arise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar
in Libanus.
Such as are planted in the house of the Lord: shall flourish in the courts of the
house of our God.
They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age: and shall be fat and wellliking.
That they may shew how true the Lord my strength is: and that there is no
unrighteousness in him.
<h3>Psalm 92</h3>
For the day before the Sabbath. When the land was first inhabited, the praise of a song by David
THE Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his
apparel, and girded himself with strength.
He hath made the round world so sure: that it cannot be moved.
Ever since the world began hath thy seat been prepared: thou art from
everlasting.
The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lift up their voice: the floods lift up
their waves.
The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly: but yet the Lord, who
dwelleth on high, is mightier.
Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becometh thine house for ever.
<h3>Psalm 93</h3>
A psalm of David for the fourth day of the week
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth: thou God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself.
Arise, thou Judge of the world: and reward the proud after their deserving.
Lord, how long shall the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly triumph?
How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully: and make such proud
boasting?
They smite down thy people, O Lord: and trouble thine heritage.
They murder the widow and the stranger: and put the fatherless to death.
And yet they say, Tush, the Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob
regard it.
Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the eye, shall he not
see?
Or he that nurtureth the heathen: it is he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not
he punish?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man: that they are but vain.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him in thy law.
That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity: until the pit be digged
up for the ungodly.
For the Lord will not fail his people: neither will he forsake his inheritance;
Until righteousness turn again unto judgement: all such as are true in heart shall
follow it.
Who will rise up with me against the wicked: or who will take my part against
the evil-doers?
If the Lord had not helped me: it had not failed but my soul had been put to
silence.
But when I said, My foot hath slipt: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.
In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart: thy comforts have
refreshed my soul.
Wilt thou have any thing to do with the stool of wickedness: which imagineth
mischief as a law?
They gather them together against the soul of the righteous: and condemn the
innocent blood.
But the Lord is my refuge: and my God is the strength of my confidence.
He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own
malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

<h3>Psalm 94</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
O COME, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our
salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: and shew ourselves glad in
him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God: and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hills is his
also.
The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep
of his hand.
To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the provocation,
and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: It is a people that
do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways;
Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.
<h3>Psalm 95</h3>
When the house was built after the captivity. A song by David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the whole earth.
Sing unto the Lord, and praise his Name: be telling of his salvation from day to
day.
Declare his honour unto the heathen: and his wonders unto all people.
For the Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised: he is more to be feared
than all gods.
As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols: but it is the Lord that made
the heavens.
Glory and worship are before him: power and honour are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people: ascribe unto the Lord
worship and power.
Ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his Name: bring presents, and come
into his courts.
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let the whole earth stand in awe of
him.
Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King: and that it is he who hath
made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; and how that he
shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea make a noise, and
all that therein is.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood
rejoice before the Lord.
For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: and with righteousness to judge
the world, and the people with his truth.
<h3>Psalm 96</h3>
For David, when his land is established
THE Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
may be glad thereof.
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgement are the
habitation of his seat.
There shall go a fire before him: and burn up his enemies on every side.
His lightnings gave shine unto the world: the earth saw it, and was afraid.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord
of the whole earth.
The heavens have declared his righteousness: and all the people have seen his
glory.
Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in vain
gods: worship him, all ye gods.
Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad, because of
thy judgements, O Lord.
For thou, Lord, art higher than all that are in the earth: thou art exalted far
above all gods.
O ye that love the Lord, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: the Lord
preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of
the ungodly.
There is sprung up a light for the righteous: and the joyful gladness for such as
are true-hearted.
Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous: and give thanks for a remembrance of his
holiness.

<h3>Psalm 97</h3>
A Psalm of David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous things.
With his own right hand, and with his holy arm: hath he gotten himself the
victory.
The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the
sight of the heathen.
He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel: and all the
ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.
Shew yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing, rejoice, and give thanks.
Praise the Lord upon the harp: sing to the harp with a psalm of thanksgiving.
With trumpets also and shawms: O shew yourselves joyful before the Lord the
King.
Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round world, and they that
dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together before the
Lord: for he is come to judge the earth.
With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with equity.
<h3>Psalm 98</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord is King, be the people never so unpatient: he sitteth between the
cherubims, be the earth never so unquiet.
The Lord is great in Sion: and high above all people.
They shall give thanks unto thy Name: which is great, wonderful, and holy.
The King's power loveth judgement; thou hast prepared equity: thou hast
executed judgement and righteousness in Jacob.
O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before his footstool, for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call upon his
Name: these called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar: for they kept his testimonies, and
the law that he gave them.
Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou forgavest them, O God, and
punishedst their own inventions.
O magnify the Lord our God, and worship him upon his holy hill: for the Lord our
God is holy.
<h3>Psalm 99</h3>
A psalm for thanksgiving
O BE joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come
before his presence with a song.
Be ye sure that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we
ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:
be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.
For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting: and his truth endureth from
generation to generation.
<h3>Psalm 100</h3>
A Psalm of David
MY SONG shall be of mercy and judgement: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.
O let me have understanding: in the way of godliness.
When wilt thou come unto me: I will walk in my house with a perfect heart.
I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of unfaithfulness: there shall
no such cleave unto me.
A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour: him will I destroy.
Whoso hath also a proud look and high stomach: I will not suffer him.
Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land: that they may dwell with
me.
Whoso leadeth a godly life: he shall be my servant.
There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house: he that telleth lies shall not
tarry in my sight.
I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land: that I may root out all
wicked doers from the city of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 101</h3>
A prayer for the poor, when he is deeply afflicted and pours out his supplication before the Lord
HEAR my prayer, O Lord: and let my crying come unto thee.
Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine ear unto me
when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.
For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt up as it
were a firebrand.
My heart is smitten down, and withered liked grass: so that I forget to eat my
bread.
For the voice of my groaning: my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.
I am become like a pelican in the wilderness: and like an owl that is in the desert.
I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that sitteth alone upon the
house-top.
Mine enemies revile me all the day long: and they that are mad upon me are
sworn together against me.
For I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping.
And that because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and
cast me down.
My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.
But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever: and thy remembrance throughout all
generations.
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that thou have mercy
upon her, yea, the time is come.
And why? thy servants think upon her stones: and it pitieth them to see her in
the dust.
The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy
majesty;
When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall appear;
When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute: and despiseth not
their desire.
This shall be written for those that come after: and the people which shall be
born shall praise the Lord.
For he hath looked down from his sanctuary: out of the heaven did the Lord
behold the earth;
That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity: and deliver the
children appointed unto death;
That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion: and his worship at
Jerusalem;
When the people are gathered together: and the kingdoms also, to serve the
Lord.
He brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.
But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age: as for thy
years, they endure throughout all generations.
Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax old as doth a
garment;
And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art
the same, and thy years shall not fail.
The children of thy servants shall continue: and their seed shall stand fast in thy
sight.
<h3>Psalm 102</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me praise his holy Name.
Praise the Lord, O my soul: and forget not all his benefits;
Who forgiveth all thy sin: and healeth all thine infirmities;
Who saveth thy life from destruction: and crowneth thee with mercy and lovingkindness;
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: making thee young and lusty as an
eagle.
The Lord executeth righteousness and judgement: for all them that are
oppressed with wrong.
He shewed his ways unto Moses: his works unto the children of Israel.
The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and of great goodness.
He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth he his anger for ever.
He hath not dealt with us after our sins: nor rewarded us according to our
wickednesses.
For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth: so great is his mercy
also toward them that fear him.
Look how wide also the east is from the west: so far hath he set our sins from us.
Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children: even so is the Lord merciful unto
them that fear him.
For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that we are but dust.
The days of man are but as grass: for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.
For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone: and the place thereof shall know
it no more.
But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon them that
fear him: and his righteousness upon children's children;
Even upon such as keep his covenant: and think upon his commandments to do
them.
The Lord hath prepared his seat in heaven: and his kingdom ruleth over all.
O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength: ye that fulfil his
commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words.
O praise the Lord, all ye his hosts: ye servants of his that do his pleasure.
O speak good of the Lord, all ye works of his, in all places of his dominion: praise
thou the Lord, O my soul.

A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art become exceeding

Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment: and spreadest out the
heavens like a curtain.
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: and maketh the clouds his
chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.
He maketh his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire.
He laid the foundations of the earth: that it never should move at any time.
Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment: the waters stand in the
hills.
At thy rebuke they flee: at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.
They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath: even unto the
place which thou hast appointed for them.
Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass: neither turn again to
cover the earth.
He sendeth the springs into the rivers: which run among the hills.
All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild asses quench their thirst.
Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation: and sing among the
branches.
He watereth the hills from above: the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
He bringeth forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the service of men;
That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of
man: and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen
man's heart.
The trees of the Lord also are full of sap: even the cedars of Libanus which he
hath planted;
Wherein the birds make their nests: and the fir-trees are a dwelling for the stork.
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats: and so are the stony rocks for the
conies.
He appointed the moon for certain seasons: and the sun knoweth his going down.
Thou makest darkness that it may be night: wherein all the beasts of the forest
do move.
The lions roaring after their prey: do seek their meat from God.
The sun ariseth, and they get them away together: and lay them down in their
dens.
Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour: until the evening.
O Lord, how manifold are thy works: in wisdom hast thou made them all; the
earth is full of thy riches.
So is the great and wide sea also: wherein are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great beasts.
There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan: whom thou hast made to take his
pastime therein.
These wait all upon thee: that thou mayest give them meat in due season.
When thou givest it them they gather it: and when thou openest thy hand they
are filled with good.
When thou hidest thy face they are troubled: when thou takest away their breath
they die, and are turned again to their dust.
When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made: and thou shalt renew
the face of the earth.
The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in
his works.
The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch the hills, they shall
smoke.
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will praise my God while I have my
being.
And so shall my words please him: my joy shall be in the Lord.
As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall
come to an end: praise thou the Lord, O my soul, praise the Lord.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 104</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his Name: tell the people what
things he hath done.
O let your songs be of him, and praise him: and let your talking be of all his
wondrous works.
Rejoice in his holy Name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek the Lord and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Remember the marvellous works that he hath done: his wonders, and the
judgements of his mouth.
O ye seed of Abraham his servant: ye children of Jacob his chosen.
He is the Lord our God: his judgements are in all the world.
He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise: that he made to a
thousand generations;
Even the covenant that he made with Abraham: and the oath that he sware unto
Isaac;
And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law: and to Israel for an everlasting
testament;
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan: the lot of your inheritance;
When there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in the land;
What time as they went from one nation to another: from one kingdom to another
people;
He suffered no man to do them wrong: but reproved even kings for their sakes;
Touch not mine Anointed: and do my prophets no harm.
Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land: and destroyed all the provision of
bread.
But he had sent a man before them: even Joseph, who was sold to be a bondservant;
Whose feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his soul;
Until the time came that his cause was known: the word of the Lord tried him.
The king sent, and delivered him: the prince of the people let him go free.
He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his substance;
That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach his senators wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people exceedingly: and made them stronger than their
enemies.
Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people: and dealt untruly with his
servants.
Then sent he Moses his servant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.
And these shewed his tokens among them: and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and it was dark: and they were not obedient unto his word.
He turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs: yea, even in their kings' chambers.
He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies: and lice in all their
quarters.
He gave them hail-stones for rain: and flames of fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and fig-trees: and destroyed the trees that were in
their coasts.
He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable:
and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their
ground.
He smote all the first-born in their land: even the chief of all their strength.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person
among their tribes.
Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were afraid of them.
He spread out a cloud to be a covering: and fire to give light in the night-season.
At their desire he brought quails: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in the
dry places.
For why? he remembered his holy promise: and Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy: and his chosen with gladness.
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people
in possession;
That they might keep his statutes: and observe his laws.

<h3>Psalm 105</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for
ever.
Who can express the noble acts of the Lord: or shew forth all his praise?
Blessed are they that alway keep judgement: and do righteousness.
Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation;
That I may see the felicity of thy chosen: and rejoice in the gladness of thy
people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers: we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly.
Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great
goodness in remembrance: but were disobedient at the sea, even at the
Red sea.
Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake: that he might make his power
to be known.
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the
deep, as through a wilderness.
And he saved them from the adversaries' hand: and delivered them from the
hand of the enemy.
As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them: there was not
one of them left.
Then believed they his words: and sang praise unto him.
But within a while they forgat his works: and would not abide his counsel.
But lust came upon them in the wilderness: and they tempted God in the desert.
And he gave them their desire: and sent leanness withal into their soul.
They angered Moses also in the tents: and Aaron the saint of the Lord.
So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of
Abiram.
And the fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the ungodly.
They made a calf in Horeb: and worshipped the molten image.
Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.
And they forgat God their Saviour: who had done so great things in Egypt;
Wondrous works in the land of Ham: and fearful things by the Red sea.
So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood
before him in the gap: to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should
destroy them.
Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no credence unto his
word;
But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord.
Then lift he up his hand against them: to overthrow them in the wilderness;
To cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves unto Baal-peor: and ate the offerings of the dead.
Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions: and the plague was
great among them.
Then stood up Phinees and prayed: and so the plague ceased.
And that was counted unto him for righteousness: among all posterities for
evermore.
They angered him also at the waters of strife: so that he punished Moses for
their sakes;
Because they provoked his spirit: so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Neither destroyed they the heathen: as the Lord commanded them;
But were mingled among the heathen: and learned their works.
Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay: yea,
they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters:
whom they had offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled
with blood.
Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring with their own
inventions.
Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people: insomuch that
he abhorred his own inheritance.
And he gave them over into the hands of the heathen: and they that hated them
were lords over them.
Their enemies oppressed them: and had them in subjection.
Many a time did he deliver them: but they rebelled against him with their own
inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.
Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity: he heard their complaint.
He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude of
his mercies: yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity
them.
Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen: that we may
give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world without end: and
let all the people say, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 106</h3>
Alleluia
Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed: and delivered from the
hand of the enemy;
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west: from the
north and from the south.
They went astray in the wilderness out of the way: and found no city to dwell in;
Hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.
So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: and he delivered them from their
distress.
He led them forth by the right way: that they might go to the city where they
dwelt.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he satisfieth the empty soul: and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: being fast bound in misery
and iron ;
Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly regarded the
counsel of the most Highest;
He also brought down their heart through heaviness: they fell down, and there
was none to help them.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death: and brake
their bonds in sunder.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he hath broken the gates of brass: and smitten the bars of iron in sunder.
Foolish men are plagued for their offence: and because of their wickedness.
Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they were even hard at death's door.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
He sent his word, and healed them: and they were saved from their destruction.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving: and tell out his
works with gladness!
They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their business in great waters;
These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.
For at his word the stormy wind ariseth: which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep: their soul
melteth away because of the trouble.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are at their wits' end.
So when thy cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivereth them out of their
distress.
For he maketh the storm to cease: so that the waves thereof are still.
Then are they glad, because they are at rest: and so he bringeth them unto the
haven where they would be.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people: and praise him
in the seat of the elders!
Who turneth the floods into a wilderness: and drieth up the water-springs.
A fruitful land maketh he barren: for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water: and water-springs of a dry
ground.
And there he setteth the hungry: that they may build them a city to dwell in.
That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards: to yield them fruits of
increase.
He blesseth them so that they multiply exceedingly: and suffereth not their cattle
to decrease.
And again, when they are minished and brought low: through oppression,
through any plague or trouble;
Though he suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants: and let them wander
out of the way in the wilderness.
Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery: and maketh him households like a flock of
sheep.
The righteous will consider this, and rejoice: and the mouth of all wickedness
shall be stopped.
Whoso is wise will ponder these things: and they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 107</h3>
Song of a psalm by David
O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing and give praise with the
best member that I have.
Awake, thou lute, and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing praises unto
thee among the nations.
For thy mercy is greater than the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
That thy beloved may be delivered: let thy right hand save them, and hear thou
me.
God hath spoken in his holiness: I will rejoice therefore, and divide Sichem, and
mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head.
Judah is my law-giver, Moab is my wash-pot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe,
upon Philistia will I triumph.
Who will lead me into the strong city: and who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou forsaken us, O God: and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our
hosts?
O help us against the enemy: for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do great acts: and it is he that shall tread down our
enemies.
<h3>Psalm 108</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise: for the mouth of the ungodly, yea, the
mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.
And they have spoken against me with false tongues: they compassed me about
also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part: but I give
myself unto prayer.
Thus have they rewarded me evil for good: and hatred for my good will.
Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand.
When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned: and let his prayer be
turned into sin.
Let his days be few: and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless: and his wife a widow.
Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread: let them seek it also out of
desolate places.
Let the extortioner consume all that he hath: and let the stranger spoil his
labour.
Let there be no man to pity him: nor to have compassion upon his fatherless
children.
Let his posterity be destroyed: and in the next generation let his name be clean
put out.
Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight of the Lord:
and let not the sin of his mother be done away.
Let them alway be before the Lord: that he may root out the memorial of them
from off the earth.
And that, because his mind was not to do good: but persecuted the poor helpless
man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.
His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him: he loved not blessing,
therefore shall it be far from him.
He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a raiment: and it shall come into his
bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be unto him as the cloke that he hath upon him: and as the girdle that he is
alway girded withal.
Let it thus happen from the Lord unto mine enemies: and to those that speak evil
against my soul.
But deal thou with me, O Lord God, according unto thy Name: for sweet is thy
mercy.
O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor: and my heart is wounded within me.
I go hence like the shadow that departeth: and am driven away as the
grasshopper.
My knees are weak through fasting: my flesh is dried up for want of fatness.
I became also a reproach unto them: they that looked upon me shaked their
heads.
Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy.
And they shall know, how that this is thy hand: and that thou, Lord, hast done it.
Though they curse, yet bless thou: and let them be confounded that rise up
against me; but let thy servant rejoice.
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame: and let them cover themselves with
their own confusion, as with a cloke.
As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth: and praise him
among the multitude.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor: to save his soul from the
unrighteous judges.

<h3>Psalm 134</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, laud ye the Name of the Lord: praise it, O ye servants of the
Lord;
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord: in the courts of the house of our God.
O praise the Lord, for the Lord is gracious: O sing praises unto his Name, for it is
lovely.
For why? the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself: and Israel for his own
possession.
For I know that the Lord is great: and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth: and in the sea,
and in all deep places.
He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world: and sendeth forth
lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his treasures.
He smote the first-born of Egypt: both of man and beast.
He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of Egypt:
upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.
He smote divers nations: and slew mighty kings;
Sehon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Basan: and all the kingdoms of
Canaan;
And gave their land to be an heritage: even an heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever: so doth thy memorial, O Lord, from one
generation to another.
For the Lord will avenge his people: and be gracious unto his servants.
As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold: the work of men's
hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, but they see not.
They have ears, and yet they hear not: neither is there any breath in their
mouths.
They that make them are like unto them: and so are all they that put their trust
in them.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Israel: praise the Lord, ye house of Aaron.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, praise the Lord.
Praised be the Lord out of Sion: who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
<h3>Psalm 135</h3>
Alleluia
O give thanks unto the God of all gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O thank the Lord of all lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who only doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who by his excellent wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who laid out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who hath made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The sun to rule the day: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The moon and the stars to govern the night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote Egypt with their first-born: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever;
With a mighty hand, and stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who divided the Red sea in two parts: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And made Israel to go through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever.
But as for Pharaoh and his host, he overthrew them in the Red sea: for his mercy
endureth for ever.
Who led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Yea, and slew mighty kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Sehon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And Og the king of Basan: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And gave away their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Even for an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who remembered us when we were in trouble: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And hath delivered us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 136</h3>
For David. A psalm of Jeremias
BY THE waters of Babylon we sat down and wept: when we remembered thee, O
Sion.
As for our harps, we hanged them up: upon the trees that are therein.
For they that led us away captive required of us then a song, and melody in our
heaviness: Sing us one of the songs of Sion.
How shall we sing the Lord's song: in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem: let my right hand forget her cunning.
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: yea, if I
prefer not Jerusalem in my mirth.
Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem: how they said,
Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.
O daughter of Babylon , wasted with misery: yea, happy shall he be that
rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us.
Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children: and throweth them against the
stones.

<h3>Psalm 137</h3>
A psalm of David, of Aggæus and Zacharias
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: even before the gods
will I sing praise unto thee.
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of thy
loving-kindness and truth: for thou hast magnified thy Name and thy word
above all things.
When I called upon thee, thou heardest me: and enduedst my soul with much
strength.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they have heard the words
of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: that great is the glory of the Lord.
For though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: as for the
proud, he beholdeth them afar off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me: thou shalt
stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy right
hand shall save me.
The lord shall make good his loving-kindness toward me: yea, thy mercy, O Lord,
endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine own hands.
<h3>Psalm 138</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
O LORD, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou knowest my downsitting and mine up-rising, thou understandest my thoughts long before.
Thou art about my path, and about my bed: and spiest out all my ways.
For lo, there is not a word in my tongue: but thou, O Lord, knowest it altogether.
Thou hast fashioned me behind and before: and laid thine hand upon me.
Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me: I cannot attain unto it.
Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit: or whither shall I go then from thy
presence?
If I climb up into heaven, thou art there: if I go down to hell, thou art there also.
If I take the wings of the morning: and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me.
If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall my night be turned
to day.
Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day:
the darkness and light to thee are both alike.
For my reins are thine: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous
are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.
My bones are not hid from thee: though I be made secretly, and fashioned
beneath in the earth.
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect: and in thy book were all
my members written;
Which day by day were fashioned: when as yet there was none of them.
How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God: O how great is the sum of them!
If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: when I wake up I am
present with thee.
Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God: depart from me, ye blood-thirsty men.
For they speak unrighteously against thee: and thine enemies take thy Name in
vain.
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee: and am not I grieved with those that
rise up against thee?
Yea, I hate them right sore: even as though they were mine enemies.
Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart: prove me, and examine my
thoughts.
Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me: and lead me in the way
everlasting.
<h3>Psalm 139</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
DELIVER me, O Lord, from the evil man: and preserve me from the wicked man.
Who imagine mischief in their hearts: and stir up strife all the day long.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: adders' poison is under their
lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly: preserve me from the wicked
men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.
The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with cords: yea, and
set traps in my way.
I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my prayers, O Lord.
O Lord God, thou strength of my health: thou hast covered my head in the day of
the battle.
Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord: let not his mischievous imagination
prosper, lest they be too proud.
Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them: that compass me
about.
Let hot burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire and into the
pit, that they never rise up again.
A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: evil shall hunt the wicked
person to overthrow him.
Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor: and maintain the cause of the
helpless.
The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name: and the just shall continue in
thy sight.

<h3>Psalm 140</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, I call upon thee, haste thee unto me: and consider my voice when I cry
unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense: and let the lifting up of my
hands be an evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and keep the door of my lips.
O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing: let me not be occupied in
ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, lest I eat of such things
as please them.
Let the righteous rather smite me friendly: and reprove me.
But let not their precious balms break my head: yea, I will pray yet against their
wickedness.
Let their judges be overthrown in stony places: that they may hear my words, for
they are sweet.
Our bones lie scattered before the pit: like as when one breaketh and heweth
wood upon the earth.
But mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust , O cast not out my
soul.
Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me: and from the traps of the
wicked doers.
Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together: and let me ever escape them.
<h3>Psalm 141</h3>
A psalm of instruction for David. When he was in the cave; a prayer
I CRIED unto the Lord with my voice: yea, even unto the Lord did I make my
supplication.
I poured out my complaints before him: and shewed him of my trouble.
When my spirit was in heaviness thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I
walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
I looked also upon my right hand: and saw there was no man that would know
me.
I had no place to flee unto: and no man cared for my soul.
I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said: Thou art my hope, and my portion in the land
of the living.
Consider my complaint: for I am brought very low.
O deliver me from my persecutors: for they are too strong for me.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name: which thing if
thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto my company.
<h3>Psalm 142</h3>
A psalm of David when his son pursued him
HEAR my prayer, O Lord, and consider my desire: hearken unto me for thy truth
and righteousness' sake.
And enter not into judgement with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
living be justified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the
ground: he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have been long
dead.
Therefore is my spirit vexed within me: and my heart within me is desolate.
Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works: yea, I exercise
myself in the works of thy hands.
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.
Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint: hide not thy face from
me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for in thee is my trust:
shew thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I flee unto thee to hide me.
Teach me to do a thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God: let thy loving
Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.
Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name's sake: and for thy righteousness' sake bring
my soul out of trouble.
And of thy goodness slay mine enemies: and destroy all them that vex my soul ;
for I am thy servant.

<h3>Psalm 143</h3>
A psalm of David concerning Goliath
BLESSED be the Lord my strength: who teacheth my hands to war, and my
fingers to fight.
My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in whom I trust:
who subdueth my people that is under me.
Lord, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him: or the son of man, that
thou so regardest him?
Man is like a thing of nought: his time passeth away like a shadow.
Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall
smoke.
Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them: shoot out thine arrows, and consume
them.
Send down thine hand from above: deliver me, and take me out of the great
waters, from the hand of strange children.
Whose mouth talketh of vanity: and their right hand is a right hand of
wickedness.
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: and sing praises unto thee upon a tenstringed lute.
Thou hast given victory unto kings: and hast delivered David thy servant from
the peril of the sword.
Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children: whose mouth talketh
of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.
That our sons may grow up as the young plants: and that our daughters may be
as the polished corners of the temple.
That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of store: that our
sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets.
That our oxen may be strong to labour, that there be no decay: no leading into
captivity, and no complaining in our streets.
Happy are the people that are in such a case: yea, blessed are the people who
have the Lord for their God.
<h3>Psalm 144</h3>
David's Psalm of praise
I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King: and I will praise thy Name for ever and
ever.
Every day will I give thanks unto thee: and praise thy Name for ever and ever.
Great is the Lord, and marvellous worthy to be praised: there is no end of his
greatness.
One generation shall praise thy works unto another: and declare thy power.
As for me, I will be talking of thy worship: thy glory, thy praise, and wondrous
works;
So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts: and I will also tell of
thy greatness.
The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be shewed: and men shall sing of
thy righteousness.
The Lord is gracious and merciful: long-suffering and of great goodness.
The Lord is loving unto every man: and his mercy is over all his works.
All thy works praise thee, O Lord: and thy saints give thanks unto thee.
They shew the glory of thy kingdom: and talk of thy power;
That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom: might be known unto
men.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom: and thy dominion endureth throughout
all ages.
The Lord upholdeth all such as fall: and lifteth up all those that are down.
The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord: and thou givest them their meat in due
season.
Thou openest thine hand: and fillest all things living with plenteousness.
The Lord is righteous in all his ways: and holy in all his works.
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: yea, all such as call upon him
faithfully.
He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will
help them.
The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but scattereth abroad all the
ungodly.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh give thanks unto his
holy Name for ever and ever.

<h3>Psalm 145</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul; while I live will I praise the Lord: yea, as long as I
have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.
O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man: for there is no help in
them.
For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn again to his earth: and then
all his thoughts perish.
Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help: and whose hope is in the
Lord his God;
Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: who keepeth his
promise for ever;
Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong: who feedeth the hungry.
The Lord looseth men out of prison: the Lord giveth sight to the blind.
The Lord helpeth them that are fallen: the Lord careth for the righteous.
The Lord careth for the strangers, he defendeth the fatherless and widow :as for
the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.
The Lord thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore: and throughout all
generations.
<h3>Psalm 146</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God: yea, a
joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: and gather together the out-casts of Israel.
He healeth those that are broken in heart: and giveth medicine to heal their
sickness.
He telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and great is his power: yea, and his wisdom is infinite.
The Lord setteth up the meek: and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground.
O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving: sing praises upon the harp unto our God;
Who covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth: and
maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men;
Who giveth fodder unto the cattle: and feedeth the young ravens that call upon
him.
He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse: neither delighteth he in any
man's legs.
But the Lord's delight is in them that fear him: and put their trust in his mercy.
<h3>Psalm 147</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.
For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates: and hath blessed thy children within
thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: and his word runneth very
swiftly.
He giveth snow like wool: and scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who is able to abide his frost?
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he bloweth with his wind, and the
waters flow.
He sheweth his word unto Jacob: his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with any nation: neither have the heathen knowledge of his
laws.

Mountains and all hills: fruitful trees and all cedars;
Beasts and all cattle: worms and feathered fowls;

Let the saints be joyful with glory: let them rejoice in their beds.
Let the praises of God be in their mouth: and a two-edged sword in their hands;
To be avenged of the heathen: and to rebuke the people;
To bind their kings in chains: and their nobles with links of iron.

O PRAISE God in his holiness: praise him in the firmament of his power.

This psalm is ascribed to David and is outside the number. When he slew Goliath in single

LITTLE was I among my brethren: a younger brother in my father’s house.
My hands, they made an instrument of music: my fingers, they prepared a
psaltery.
And who shall bring back tidings to my master? The Lord himself, himself gives
ear.
Himself sent forth his messenger: and took me from among my father’s sheep;
and with the oil of his anointing He anointed me.
Comely my brethren were and tall: and yet they found not favor with the Lord.
But I, I sallied forth to meet the alien: and he reviled me by all his idols.
But I drew forth the sword that was beside him: I cut his head off with it, and
from the sons of Israel removed reproach.</div>

        </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the precious and life-creating Cross, the acrostic whereof is “By Thy Passion Thou dost save me from the passions, O my Christ”, the composition of Joseph, in Tone V:  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Unto God the Savior * Who made His people pass dryshod through the sea, * but drowned Pharaoh with all his host, * unto Him alone let us sing: * For He hath been glorified. It was Thine own desire to didst endure the passion-slaying Passion, O Christ, and thereby slay him who of old brought death upon us in paradise; wherefore, we glorify Thy goodness. Thou wast lifted up upon the Cross, and the enemy fell headlong; and we, who are fallen, have been raised up and been made inhabitants of paradise, O Christ, glorifying the might of Thy kingdom. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Well armed with the shield of the Cross, ye arrayed yourselves for every battle with the demon, O most wise great-martyrs; and having vanquished him, ye have received glory. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Like honored sheep ye offered yourselves unto the Lamb Who was slain for our sake, O spiritual athletes, manifestly abolishing the sac-rifices of the ungodly; wherefore, we call you blessed, O all-praised ones. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> For us, O pure Virgin, thou hast given birth to a little Babe, the Ancient of days, Who by His divine sufferings hath renewed human nature, which had grown old, O all-immaculate one. </p><p><i class="note">Another canon, of the Theotokos, in Tone V:  </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i></i> Same as the foregoing. I know thee, O all-immaculate Mary, Virgin and Mother, to be a wellspring of compassion and a fervent intercessor; and I cry out to thee: Have mercy and compassion upon my humbled soul. Making His abode within thy womb, and taking human essence upon Himself, in that He is good, O pure one, the Son of God hath delivered all from the corruption of the serpent. Be mine enlightenment and hope of salvation, O all-immaculate Birthgiver of God, loosing the bonds of my transgressions, and delivering me from the torments and condemnation which are to come. Free my lowly soul from wicked thoughts, O Birthgiver of God, and make it a dwelling-place of God, that I may always glorify thee as is meet. </p><h3>Ode III</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> By the power of Thy Cross, O Christ, * do Thou make steadfast mine understanding, * that I may hymn and glorify Thine arising on the third day.  Nailed to the Tree, O Savior, Thou dost cause the fruit of corruption to wither away, and from Thy side poured forth upon us streams of incorruption, O Master. Thou wast slaughtered on the Tree like a lamb, O Master, marking the linings of our souls with Thy divine blood; wherefore, we glorify Thee with fear. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Bound with bonds, wounded in many and various ways, and cast to the wild beasts, O spiritual athletes, ye remained unshaken. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> As grapes of the Vine of life ye poured forth the wine of martyrdom which gladdens the hearts of the faithful, O martyrs of our God. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Dying upon the Cross, thy Son and Lord was shown to be the Mediator of life for us, O pure one, glorifying those who hymn thee. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. By thy compassionate goodness, O Birthgiver of God, lead me up who have fallen into the destructive pit of grievous offenses. Arriving at the eventide of life, I am held fast by perplexity, O all-hymned one, and I cry out to thee: Show thyself to be my helper! O pure and holy Theotokos, grant me remission of sins, and ask for me salvation and everlasting joy.' Grant me tear-drops, O pure one, that I may drive doubt from my heart and earnestly hymn thee. </p><h3>Ode IV</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> I have heard report of the mighty deed * of Thy Cross, O Lord, * how Paradise was opened thereby, and I cried: * Glory to Thy power, O Lord. When Thou didst set upon the Cross, O Christ, Sun of righteousness, Thou didst shine forth never-waning light upon us who hymn Thine awesome dispensation, O Word. When once thou didst stand before the judgment-seat, O Christ our Judge, Thou didst condemn the unjust foe; and Thou wast crucified between the unrighteous thieves, justifying us. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Crowned with victory, the spiritual athletes of the Lord put the invisible enemy to shame, and cried aloud: Glory be to Thy power, O Lord! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Assembling with faith, let us honor the passion-bearers of Christ, the never-fading flowers of the noetic paradise, the most precious vessels. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> When thou didst behold on the Cross Christ to Whom thou hast given birth, O pure one, thou didst marvel at His ineffable long-suffering; wherefore, with Him we glorify thee. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. Who can entreat the Judge concerning my wicked deeds and my transgressions if not thee, O pure one, thou only helper of the sinful? By thy power, O most pure one, raise me up who have fallen through many transgressions and enslaved my soul through sins, and free me from slavery by thy prayer. As thou hast given birth to the Creator and King of all, O all-immaculate and pure Theotokos, deliver me from every vile offense. I weep over myself when I bring to mind my many transgressions and the unquenchable fire; and I pray: Grant me time to repent, O most pure one. </p><h3>Ode V</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Waking at dawn, * we cry unto Thee, O Lord: * Save us, for Thou art our God; * we know none other besides Thee.  When the rocks felt Thee lifted up upon the Tree, O Christ, they split asunder, and the foundations of the earth were shaken. The sun set aside its radiance when Thou wast lifted up upon the Tree, O long-suffering Sun of righteousness. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The saints shine forth with the radiance of miracles, by the Spirit dispelling the darkness of sicknesses. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Your bodies were dismembered with the sword, O martyrs, but the spirit of divine love was never severed from you. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Seeing the Savior lifted up upon the Cross, O all-immaculate Virgin Mother, thou didst lift up thy voice in lamentation. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. O Lady, apply the bandages of thy tender compassion to the bruises which through sin have come to cover my whole body. Of old thou didst halt the advance of corruption by thy divine birthgiving, O most immaculate one, and thou hast now staunched the progress of my sins. Have mercy and compassion upon my soul, O Lady, and deliver it from condemnation and eternal torment. Look down and hearken unto my voice, O Lady, and deliver me from everlasting torment, I pray. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The abyss hath encompassed me, * the sea monster hath become my grave; * but I cried unto Thee, * the Lover of mankind, * and Thy right hand saved me, O Lord.  When the Cross was planted in the ground, the fall of the demons came about, faith received the beginning of its confirmation, and evil hath been driven from our midst. The sun was extinguished when Thou didst light Thy flesh like a lamp upon the Tree, O Lord; and the coin was found which had been lost through the dark passions. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> When Thou wast lifted up upon the Tree, Thou didst have the choir of martyrs following in Thy steps, emulating Thy Passion as the mediator of dispassion, O Lover of mankind. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With the streams of your blood ye dried up the torrents of delusion, O crowned martyrs, and ye extinguished the alien fire of the demons with divine dew. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> A sword pierced thy heart, O all-immaculate Virgin, when thou didst behold the Creator crucified, His divine side pierced by a spear. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. The deep of transgressions hath surrounded me, and the abyss of sin hath firmly gripped me, and bringeth me to pernicious despair. But save me now, O holy Lady! Raise me up who lie upon the bed offenses, O most holy Lady, and grant me the effulgence of salvation through repentance. Through the supplications of her who in purity gave birth to Thee, cleanse me, O Lover of mankind; and deliver Thy world from all tribulation, and vouchsafe us everlasting glory. I ever promise to cease mine evil deeds, yet I always lie, and grieve my Master. O most pure Lady, grant me correction. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The children were saved * in the burning furnace, * chanting: Blessed art Thou * O God of our fathers. That we might be delivered from pleasurable sin, Thou didst taste gall, O Christ, Thou sweetness of life. When Thou wast wounded on the Tree, O Christ, Thou didst heal the wounds Adam had suffered for many years. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With eagerness of will ye set yourselves apart for suffering, O passion-bearers, and were shown to be victors. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having honored God by enduring painful dishonor, O spiritual athletes, ye received honor on high. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> After giving birth thou hast remained as thou wast before birthgiving, O pure one; for God was born, that He might deify mankind. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. O pure Birthgiver of God, disdain me not who with faith ever flee beneath thy protection. O Birthgiver of God who ever driest up the pasture of my passions, grant that I may shed abundant drops of tears. By thy supplications release me who am bound with the chains of my sins, O most immaculate one, for thou hast given birth to our all-hymned God. Unto thee do I flee with faith, O pure one, and to thee do I cry: Deliver me from everlasting fire, O Virgin! </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The Son of God who before all ages * wast born of the Father * hath in these last times * become incarnate of the Virgin-Mother, * O ye priests hymn, * and ye peoples supremely exalt Him throughout all ages. O Savior, Who healed the curse of the tree by the Tree and hast poured forth blessing upon mankind, we hymn and glorify Thee throughout the ages! By Thy Cross Thou didst bring down the serpent who exalted himself, and when Thou wast laid low Thou didst raise up him who had grievously fallen. Thee, O Savior, do we hymn and supremely exalt throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With faith let us hymn the passion-bearers in the heavens: the destroyers of delusion, the champions of the divine Faith, the pillars of the Church, the truly hard diamonds, the warriors of Christ. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The glorious passion-bearers shone forth like the sun, through grace driving away the clouds of sicknesses; and by faith in the Trinity they dispelled the gloom of ungodliness. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Gabriel was sent as an escort for the bride, O Virgin, and he cried out to thee, saying: O most splendid palace of Christ, the King of all, when He shall make His abode within thee, He shall deify all mankind! </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. At a loss, I have no fear of the threat of Gehenna in either heart or mind, and I ever commit sins; but do thou, O Virgin, free me from vexation, and deliver me from the fire. I am often dragged out and sold like a captive by the pleasures of my flesh, and I ever anger God. O Theotokos, thou only help of the helpless, do thou thyself have mercy upon me! Thy prayer is sure and certain, O all-immaculate one, for whatsoever things thou desirest thou givest, entreating thy Son and God. Wherefore, I pray thee: Have mercy and save my lowly soul! I am cruelly tested by bodily sickness, rising passions and wounds of soul. O thou who hast given birth to the only Benefactor, by thy supplications restore my health. We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the </p><p><i class="note">refrain:</i> “More honorable than the cherubim ...”<i class="note"> Prostrations.</i> </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Thee the true Mother of God, * who above all understanding * and beyond all description, * ineffably brought forth in time * the Eternal One, * with one mind do we the faithful magnify. The might and dominion of the enemy were taken away, O only mighty Lord, when Thou wast lifted up upon the Cross and didst bloody Thy fingers thereon. O my Christ, the iniquitous ones who crucified Thee impaled Thy hands and feet and reckoned the number of Thy bones; and they gave thee vinegar with gall to drink. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Before the tyrants ye preached God Who became man with radiant mouths, O passion-bearers, and have inherited glory. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Beating you, the enemies who wounded you with stripes and divers tortures became sick, O divine martyrs, all-honored physicians of illnesses. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Jesus the Light shone forth upon us from thee, O pure one, and enlightened all creation by His crucifixion, dispelling the darkness of the demons. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. Grant me tears of repentance before the end of my life arrives, O most pure one, that I may weep over my grievous and unjust deeds. Why dost thou offend thy Master, O my soul, committing unrighteous deeds? Why dost thou not arise? Wherefore, before the end hasten thou to repent. Deliver me from evil transgressions and tribulations. Grant me mercy, O all-pure Virgin, and a divine share in incorruptible life. Thee have we acquired as the intercessor who hast ineffably given birth unto God, the insurmountable rampart and salvation of our souls, and a wellspring of miracles.

<h3>Psalm 119</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN I was in trouble I called upon the Lord: and he heard me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitful tongue.
What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue: even mighty
and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.
Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech: and to have my
habitation among the tents of Kedar.
My soul hath long dwelt among them: that are enemies unto peace.
I labour for peace, but when I speak unto them thereof: they make them ready to
battle.
<h3>Psalm 120</h3>
A song of ascents
I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel: shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defence upon thy right hand.
So that the sun shall not burn thee by day: neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even he that shall keep thy
soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from this time forth for
evermore.
<h3>Psalm 121</h3>
A song of ascents
I WAS glad when they said unto me: We will go into the house of the Lord.
Our feet shall stand in thy gates: O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city: that is at unity in itself.
For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord: to testify unto Israel, to
give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.
For there is the seat of judgement: even the seat of the house of David.
O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
Peace be within thy walls: and plenteousness within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions' sakes: I will wish thee prosperity.
Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God: I will seek to do thee good.
<h3>Psalm 122</h3>
A song of ascents
UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as
the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even so our eyes wait
upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are utterly despised.
Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy: and with the
despitefulness of the proud.
<h3>Psalm 123</h3>
A song of ascents
IF THE Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say: if the Lord
himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;
They had swallowed us up quick: when thy were so wrathfully displeased at us.
Yea, the waters had drowned us: and the stream had gone over our soul.
The deep waters of the proud: had gone even over our soul.
But praised be the Lord: who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.
Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler: the snare is
broken, and we are delivered .
Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.

<h3>Psalm 124</h3>
A song of ascents
THEY that put their trust in the Lord shall be even as the mount Sion: which may
not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.
The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about his
people, from this time forth for evermore.
For the rod of the ungodly cometh not into the lot of the righteous: lest the
righteous put their hand unto wickedness.
Do well, O Lord: unto those that are good and true of heart.
As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness: the Lord shall lead them
forth with the evil-doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 125</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion: then were we like unto them
that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue with joy.
Then said they among the heathen: The Lord hath done great things for them.
Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already: whereof we rejoice.
Turn our captivity, O Lord: as the rivers in the south.
They that sow in tears: shall reap in joy.
He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed: shall
doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.
<h3>Psalm 126</h3>
A song of ascents
EXCEPT the Lord build the house: their labour is but lost that build it.
Except the Lord keep the city: the watchman waketh but in vain.
It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat
the bread of carefulness: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Lo, children and the fruit of the womb: are an heritage and gift that cometh of
the Lord.
Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant: even so are the young children.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed
when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
<h3>Psalm 127</h3>
A song of ascents
BLESSED are all they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: O well is thee, and happy shalt
thou be.
Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of thine house.
Thy children like the olive-branches: round about thy table.
Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the Lord.
The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shalt see Jerusalem in
prosperity all thy life long.
Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children: and peace upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 128</h3>
A song of ascents
MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up: may Israel now
say.
Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up: but they have not
prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed upon my back: and made long furrows.
But the righteous Lord: hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.
Let them be confounded and turned backward: as many as have evil will at Sion.
Let them be even as the grass growing upon the house-tops: which withereth
afore it be plucked up;
Whereof the mower filleth not his hand: neither he that bindeth up the sheaves
his bosom.
So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord prosper you: we wish you
good luck in the Name of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 129</h3>
A song of ascents
OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.
O let thine ears consider well: the voice of my complaint.
If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss: O Lord, who may
abide it?
For there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared.
I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him: in his word is my trust.
My soul fleeth unto the Lord: before the morning watch, I say, before the
morning watch.
O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with him is
plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel: from all his sins.
<h3>Psalm 130</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, I am not high-minded: I have no proud looks.
I do not exercise myself in great matters: which are too high for me.
But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his
mother: yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.
O Israel, trust in the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 131</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, remember David: and all his trouble;
How he sware unto the Lord: and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God of Jacob;
I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house: nor climb up into my bed;
I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eye-lids to slumber: neither the
temples of my head to take any rest;
Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord: an habitation for the mighty
God of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of the same at Ephrata: and found it in the wood.
We will go into his tabernacle: and fall low on our knees before his footstool.
Arise, O Lord, into thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness: and let thy saints sing with
joyfulness.
For thy servant David's sake: turn not away the presence of thine Anointed.
The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David: and he shall not shrink from it;
Of the fruit of thy body: shall I set upon thy seat.
If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall learn them:
their children also shall sit upon thy seat for evermore.
For the Lord hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself: he hath longed for
her.
This shall be my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.
I will bless her victuals with increase: and will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will deck her priests with health: and her saints shall rejoice and sing.
There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: I have ordained a lantern for
mine Anointed.
As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame: but upon himself shall his
crown flourish.
<h3>Psalm 132</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is: brethren, to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down unto the beard:
even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts of his clothing.
Like as the dew of Hermon: which fell upon the hill of Sion.
For there the Lord promised his blessing: and life for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 133</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD now, praise the Lord: all ye servants of the Lord;
Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord: even in the courts of the house of
our God.
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary: and praise the Lord.
The Lord that made heaven and earth: give thee blessing out of Sion.

<h3>Psalm 109</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool.
The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: be thou ruler, even in the
midst among thine enemies.
In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free-will offerings with an holy
worship: the dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning.
The Lord sware, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech..
The Lord upon thy right hand: shall wound even kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places with the dead bodies:
and smite in sunder the heads over divers countries.
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up his head.
<h3>Psalm 110</h3>
Alleluia
I WILL give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart: secretly among the
faithful, and in the congregation.
The works of the Lord are great: sought out of all of them that have pleasure
therein.
His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour: and his righteousness
endureth for ever.
The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvellous works: that they
ought to be had in remembrance.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he shall ever be mindful of his
covenant.
He hath shewed his people the power of his works: that he may give them the
heritage of the heathen.
The works of his hands are verity and judgement: all his commandments are
true.
They stand fast for ever and ever: and are done in truth and equity.
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever;
holy and reverend is his Name.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all
they that do thereafter; the praise of it endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 111</h3>
Alleluia
BLESSED is the man that feareth the Lord: he hath great delight in his
commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall be
blessed.
Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth
for ever.
Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness: he is merciful, loving, and
righteous.
A good man is merciful, and lendeth: and will guide his words with discretion.
For he shall never be moved: and the righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance.
He will not be afraid of any evil tidings: for his heart standeth fast, and believeth
in the Lord.
His heart is established, and will not shrink: until he see his desire upon his
enemies.
He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor: and his righteousness
remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him: he shall gnash with his teeth,
and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.

<h3>Psalm 112</h3>
Alleluia
PRAISE the Lord, ye servants: O praise the Name of the Lord.
Blessed be the Name of the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
The Lord's Name is praised: from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of
the same.
The Lord is high above all heathen and his glory above the heavens.
Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling so high: and yet
humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?
He taketh up the simple out of the dust: and lifteth the poor out of the mire;
That he may set him with the princes: even with the princes of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house: and to be a joyful mother of
children.
<h3>Psalm 113</h3>
Alleluia
WHEN Israel came out of Egypt: and the house of Jacob from among the strange
people.
Judah was his sanctuary: and Israel his dominion.
The sea saw that, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams: and the little hills like young sheep.
What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest: and thou Jordan, that thou wast
driven back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams: and ye little hills, like young sheep?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the God of
Jacob.
Who turned the hard rock into a standing water: and the flint-stone into a
springing well.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise: for thy
loving mercy and for thy truth's sake.
Wherefore shall the heathen say: Where is now their God?
As for our God, he is in heaven: he hath done whatsoever pleased him.
Their idols are silver and gold: even the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not.
They have ears, and hear not: noses have they and smell not.
They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not: neither speak
they through their throat.
They that make them are like unto them ; and so are all such as put their trust in
them.
But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their succour and defence.
Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
Ye that fear the Lord, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
The Lord hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us: even he shall bless the
house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.
He shall bless them that fear the Lord: both small and great.
The Lord shall increase you more and more: you and your children.
Ye are the blessed of the Lord: who made heaven and earth.
All the whole heavens are the Lord's: the earth hath he given to the children of
men.
The dead praise not thee, O Lord: neither all they that go down into silence.
But we will praise the Lord: from this time forth for evermore. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 114</h3>
Alleluia
I AM well pleased: that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer.
That he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call upon him as long as I
live.
The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of hell gat hold
upon me.
I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I will call upon the Name of the Lord: O
Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea, our God is merciful
The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.
Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul: for the Lord hath rewarded thee.
And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from tears, and my
feet from falling.
I will walk before the Lord: in the land of the living.

<h3>Psalm 115</h3>
Alleluia
I BELIEVED, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled: I said in my
haste, All men are liars.
What reward shall I give unto the Lord: for all the benefits that he hath done
unto me?
I will receive the cup of salvation: and call upon the Name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: right dear in the sight of
the Lord is the death of his saints.
Behold, O Lord, how that I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thine
handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the Name of
the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of all his people: in the courts of
the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 116</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, all ye heathen: praise him, all ye nations.
For his merciful kindness is ever more and more towards us: and the truth of the
Lord endureth for ever. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 117</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: because his mercy endureth for
ever.
Let Israel now confess that he is gracious: and that his mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
Yea, let them now that fear the Lord confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
I called upon the Lord in trouble: and the Lord heard me at large.
The Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man doeth unto me.
The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire
upon mine enemies.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in man.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in princes.
All nations compassed me round about: but in the Name of the Lord will I destroy
them.
They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side: but in the
Name of the Lord will I destroy them.
They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire among the thorns:
for in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.
Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but the Lord was my help.
The Lord is my strength, and my song: and is become my salvation.
The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous: the right hand of
the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass.
The right hand of the Lord hath the pre-eminence: the right hand of the Lord
bringeth mighty things to pass.
I shall not die, but live: and declare the works of the Lord.
The Lord hath chastened and corrected me: but he hath not given me over unto
death.
Open me the gates of righteousness: that I may go into them, and give thanks
unto the Lord.
This is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into it.
I will thank thee, for thou hast heard me: and art become my salvation.

This is the day which the Lord hath made: we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Help me now, O Lord: O Lord, send us now prosperity.
Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: we have wished you good
luck , ye that are of the house of the Lord.
God is the Lord who hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, yea,
even unto the horns of the altar.
Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: thou art my God, and I will praise thee.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for ever.

Surrendering your bodies to arrogant judges, ye endured unbearable wounds, O valiant spiritual athletes, expecting to receive honors from on high; and Christ led you into the eternal mansions of those who rejoice and chant the hymn of victory.

<h4>First Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 1</h3>
BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
stood in the way of sinners: and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful.
But his delight is in the law of the Lord: and in his law will he exercise himself
day and night.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side: that will bring forth his
fruit in due season.
His leaf also shall not wither: and look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper.
As for the ungodly, it is not so with them: but they are like the chaff, which the
wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.
Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment: neither the
sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
But the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: and the way of the ungodly shall
perish.
<h3>Psalm 2</h3>
WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why do the people imagine a
vain thing?
The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together: against the
Lord, and against his Anointed.
Let us break their bonds asunder: and cast away their cords from us.
He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: the Lord shall have them
in derision.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath: and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Yet I have set my King: upon my holy hill of Sion.
I will preach the law, whereof the Lord hath said unto me: Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee.
Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance: and the
utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron: and break them in pieces like a
potter's vessel.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be learned, ye that are judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord in fear: and rejoice unto him with reverence.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way: if his wrath
be kindled, (yea, but a little,) blessed are all they that put their trust in
him.
<h3>Psalm 3</h3>
A psalm of David. When he fled from the presence of his son Absalom
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me: many are they that rise against
me.
Many one there be that say of my soul: There is no help for him in his God.
But thou, O Lord, art my defender: thou art my worship, and the lifter up of my
head.
I did call upon the Lord with my voice: and he heard me out of his holy hill.
I laid me down and slept, and rose up again: for the Lord sustained me.
I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people: that have set themselves
against me round about.
Up, Lord, and help me, O my God: for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the
cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.
    </div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 4</h3>
For the end. A song of David among the Psalms
HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast set me at liberty
when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour: and have such
pleasure in vanity, and seek after leasing?
Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that is godly: when
I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart, and in your chamber,
and be still.
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness: and put your trust in the Lord.
There be many that say: Who will shew us any good?
Lord, lift thou up: the light of thy countenance upon us.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart: since the time that their corn and wine and
oil increased.
I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest: for it is thou, Lord, only, that
makest me dwell in safety.
<h3>Psalm 5</h3>
For the end. A song of David concerning her that inherits
PONDER my words, O Lord: consider my meditation
O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King, and my God: for unto thee
will I make my prayer.
My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O Lord: early in the morning will I direct my
prayer unto thee, and will look up.
For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness: neither shall any devil
dwell with thee.
Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest all of them that
work vanity.
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor both the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude of thy
mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies: make thy way
plain before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in his mouth: their inward parts are very wickedness.
Their throat is an open sepulchre: they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own imaginations: cast
them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebelled
against thee.
And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: they shall ever be giving of
thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be
joyful in thee;
For thou, Lord, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous: and with thy favourable
kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
<h3>Psalm 6</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns for the eighth
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy
displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones are
vexed.
My soul also is sore troubled: but, Lord, how long wilt thou punish me?
Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's sake.
For in death no man remembereth thee: and who will give thee thanks in the pit?
I am weary of my groaning; every night wash I my bed: and water my couch with
my tears.
My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of all mine enemies.
Away from me, all ye that work vanity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my
weeping.
The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer.
All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed: they shall be turned back,
and put to shame suddenly.
    </div>
      
        <div>
<h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 7</h3>
A psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the Benjamite
O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all them that
persecute me, and deliver me;
Lest he devour my soul, like a lion, and tear it in pieces: while there is none to
help.
O Lord my God, if I have done any such thing: or if there be any wickedness in
my hands;
If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me: yea, I have delivered
him that without any cause is mine enemy,
Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me: yea, let him tread my life
down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.
Stand up, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignation of
mine enemies: arise up for me in the judgement that thou hast
commanded.
And so shall the congregation of the people come about thee: for their sakes
therefore lift up thyself again.
The Lord shall judge the people; give sentence with me, O Lord: according to my
righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in me.
O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end: but guide thou the just.
For the righteous God: trieth the very hearts and reins.
My help cometh of God: who preserveth them that are true of heart.
God is a righteous Judge, strong and patient: and God is provoked every day.
If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword: he hath bent his bow, and made it
ready.
He hath prepared for him the instruments of death: he ordaineth his arrows
against the persecutors
Behold, he travaileth with mischief: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth
ungodliness.
He hath graven and digged up a pit: and is fallen on himself into the destruction
that he made for other.
For his travail shall come upon his own head: and his wickedness shall fall on his
own pate.
I will give thanks unto the Lord, according to his righteousness: and I will praise
the Name of the Lord most High.
<h3>Psalm 8</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the winepresses
O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world: thou hast set
thy glory above the heavens!
Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength,
because of thine enemies: that thou mightest still the enemy and the
avenger.
For I will consider thy heavens, even the works of thy fingers: the moon and the
stars, which thou hast ordained.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him: and the son of man, that thou visitest
him?
Thou madest him lower than the angels: to crown him with glory and worship.
Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands: and thou hast put
all things in subjection under his feet;
All sheep and oxen: yea, and the beasts of the field;
The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and whatsoever walketh through
the paths of the seas.
O Lord our Governor: how excellent is thy Name in all the world!

<h3>Psalm9</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the secrets of the Son
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will speak of all thy
marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O thou
most Highest.
While mine enemies are driven back: they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in the throne that
judgest right.
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly: thou hast put out
their name for ever and ever.
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: even as the cities which
thou hast destroyed, their memorial is perished with them.
But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath also prepared his seat for judgement.
For he shall judge the world in righteousness: and minister true judgement unto
the people.
The Lord also will be a defence for the oppressed: even a refuge in due time of
trouble.
And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast
never failed them that seek thee.
O praise the Lord which dwelleth in Sion: show the people of his doings.
For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them :and forgetteth
not the complaint of the poor.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider the trouble which I suffer of them that
hate me: thou that liftest me up from the gates of death.
That I may shew all thy praises within the ports of the daughter of Sion: I will
rejoice in thy salvation.
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the same net which they
hid privily, is their foot taken.
The Lord is known to execute judgement: the ungodly is trapped in the work of
his own hands.
The wicked shall be turned into hell: and all the people that forget God.
For the poor shall not always be forgotten: the patient abiding of the meek shall
not perish for ever.
Up, Lord, and let not man have the upper hand: let the heathen be judged in thy
sight.
Put them in fear, O Lord: that the heathen may know themselves to be but men.
Why standest thou so far off, O Lord: and hidest thy face in the needful time of
trouble?
The ungodly for his own lust doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the
crafty wiliness that they have imagined.
For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire: and speaketh good of
the covetous, whom God abhorreth.
The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God ; neither is God in all his
thoughts.
His ways are always grievous: thy judgments are far above out of his sight, and
therefore defieth he all his enemies.
For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down: there shall no
harm happen unto me.
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is ungodliness
and vanity.
He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets: and privily in his lurking
dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.
For he lieth waiting secretly, even as a lion lurketh he in his den: that he may
ravish the poor.
He doth ravish the poor: when he getteth him into his net.
He falleth down, and humbleth himself: that the congregation of the poor may
fall into the hands of his captains.
He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face, and
he will never see it.
Arise, O Lord God, and lift up thine hand: forget not the poor.
Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God: while he doth say in his heart,
Tush, thou God carest not for it.
Surely thou hast seen it: for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong.
That thou mayest take the matter into thy hand: the poor committeth himself
unto thee; for thou art the helper of the friendless.
Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious: take away his ungodliness,
and thou shalt find none.
The Lord is King for ever and ever: and the heathen are perished out of the land.
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the poor: thou preparest their heart, and
thine ear hearkeneth thereto;
To help the fatherless and poor unto their right: that the man of the earth be no
more exalted against them.
<h3>Psalm10</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
IN THE Lord put I my trust: how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a
bird unto the hill?
For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the
quiver: that they may privily shoot at them which are true of heart.
For the foundations will be cast down: and what have the righteous done?
The Lord is in his holy temple: the Lord's seat is in heaven.
His eyes consider the poor: and his eye-lids try the children of men.
The Lord alloweth the righteous: but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in
wickedness, doth his soul abhor.
Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest:
this shall be their portion to drink.
For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness: his countenance will behold the
thing that is just
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm11</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, upon the eighth
HELP me, Lord, for there is not one godly man left: for the faithful are minished
from among the children of men,
They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour: they do but flatter with their
lips, and dissemble in their double heart.
The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips: and the tongue that speaketh proud
things;
Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail: we are they that ought to
speak , who is lord over us?
Now for the comfortless trouble's sake of the needy: and because of the deep
sighing of the poor,
I will up, saith the Lord: and will help every one from him that swelleth against
him, and will set him at rest.
The words of the Lord are pure words: even as the silver, which from the earth is
tried, and purified seven times in the fire.
Thou shalt keep them, O Lord: thou shalt preserve him from this generation for
ever.
The ungodly walk on every side: when they are exalted, the children of men are
put to rebuke.
<h3>Psalm12</h3>
For the end, psalm of David
HOW long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever: how long wilt thou hide thy face
from me?
How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart: how long
shall mine enemies triumph over me?
Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in
death.
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: for if I be cast down, they
that trouble me will rejoice at it.
But my trust is in thy mercy: and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.
I will sing of the Lord, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me: yea, I will
praise the Name of the Lord most Highest.
<h3>Psalm13</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE fool hath said in his heart: There is no God.
They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings: there is none that
doeth good, no not one.
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there
were any that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is none that doeth good, no not one.
Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have they deceived: the
poison of asps is under their lips.
Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood.
Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they not
known ; there is no fear of God before their eyes.
Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief: eating up my
people as it were bread, and call not upon the Lord?
There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was: for God is in the
generation of the righteous.
As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor: because he putteth
his trust in the Lord.
Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turneth the
captivity of his people: then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

<h3>Psalm14</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle: or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?
Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life: and doeth the thing which is right, and
speaketh the truth from his heart.
He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour: and
hath not slandered his neighbour.
He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes: and maketh much of
them that fear the Lord.
He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not: thou it were to
his own hindrance.
He that hath not given his money upon usury: nor taken reward against the
innocent.
Whoso doeth these things: shall never fall.
<h3>Psalm15</h3>
A writing of David
PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee have I put my trust.
O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, my goods are nothing
unto thee.
All my delight is upon the saints, that are in the earth: and upon such as excel in
virtue.
But they that run after another god: shall have great trouble.
Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer: neither make mention of their
names within my lips.
The Lord himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou shalt
maintain my lot.
The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will thank the Lord for giving me warning: my reins also chasten me in the
night-season.
I have set God always before me: for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not
fall.
Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiced: my flesh also shall rest in
hope.
For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell: neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy
One to see corruption.
Thou shalt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is the fulness of joy: and at
thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.
<h3>Psalm16</h3>
A prayer of David
HEAR the right, O Lord, consider my complaint: and hearken unto my prayer,
that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence: and let thine eyes look upon the
thing that is equal.
Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night-season; thou hast tried me,
and shalt find no wickedness in me; for I am utterly purposed that my
mouth shall not offend.
Because of men's works, that are done against the words of thy lips: I have kept
me from the ways of the destroyer.
O hold thou up my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps slip not.
I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: incline thine ear to me,
and hearken unto my words.
Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which
put their trust in thee: from such as resist thy right hand.
Keep me as the apple of an eye: hide me under the shadow of thy wings.
From the ungodly that trouble me: mine enemies compass me round about to
take away my soul.
They are enclosed in their own fat: and their mouth speaketh proud things.
They lie waiting in our way on every side: turning their eyes down to the ground.
Like of a lion that is greedy of his prey: and as it were a lion's whelp. lurking in
secret places.
Up, Lord, disappoint him, and cast him down: deliver my soul from the ungodly,
which is a sword of thine;
From the men of thy hand, O Lord, from the men, I say, and from the evil world:
which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid
treasure.
They have children at their desire: and leave the rest of their substance for their
babes.
But as for me, I will behold thy presence in righteousness: and when I awake up
after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied with it.</div>

<h3>Psalm 17</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David the servant of the Lord. The words which he spoke to the Lord,
even the words of this song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his
enemies, and out of the hand of Saul. And he said:
I WILL love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony rock, and my
defence: my saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust, my
buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.
I will call upon the Lord, which is worthy to be praised: so shall I be safe from
mine enemies.
The sorrows of death compassed me: and the overflowings of ungodliness made
me afraid.
The pains of hell came about me: the snares of death overtook me.
In my trouble I will call upon the Lord: and complain unto my God.
So shall he hear my voice out of his holy temple: and my complaint shall come
before him, it shall enter even into his ears.
The earth trembled and quaked: the very foundations also of the hills shook, and
were removed, because he was wroth.
There went a smoke out in his presence: and a consuming fire out of his mouth,
so that coals were kindled at it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and it was dark under his feet.
He rode upon the cherubim, and did fly: he came flying upon the wings of the
wind.
He made darkness his secret place: his pavilion round about him, with dark
water and thick clouds to cover him.
At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed: hail-stones and coals of
fire.
The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hailstones and coals of fire.
He sent out his arrows, and scattered them: he cast forth lightnings, and
destroyed them.
The springs of water were seen, and the foundations of the round world were
discovered, at thy chiding, O Lord: at the blasting of the breath of thy
displeasure.
He shall send down from on high to fetch me: and shall take me out of many
waters.
He shall deliver from me my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me: for
they are too mighty for me.
They prevented me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my upholder.
He brought me forth also into a place of liberty: he brought me forth even
because he had a favour unto me.
The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing: according to the cleanness
of my hands shall he recompense me.
Because I have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not forsaken my God, as the
wicked doth.
For I have an eye unto all his laws: and will not cast out his commandments from
me.
I was also uncorrupt before him: and eschewed mine own wickedness.
Therefore shall the Lord reward me after my righteous dealing: and according
unto the cleanness of my hands in his eye-sight.
With the holy thou shalt be holy: and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.
With the clean thou shalt be clean: and with the froward thou shalt learn
frowardness.
For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity: and shalt bring down the
high looks of the proud.
Thou also shalt light my candle: the Lord my God shall make my darkness to be
light.
For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men: and with the help of my God I shall
leap over the wall.
The way of God is an undefiled way: the word of the Lord also is tried in the fire;
he is the defender of all them that put their trust in him.
For who is God, but the Lord: or who hath any strength, except our God?
It is God, that girdeth me with strength of war: and maketh my way perfect.
He maketh my feet like harts' feet: and setteth me up on high.
He teacheth mine hands to fight: and mine arms shall break even a bow of steel.
Thou hast given me the defence of my salvation: thy right hand also shall hold
me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.
Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go: that my footsteps shall not
slide.
I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them: neither will I turn again till I
have destroyed them.
I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand: but fall under my feet.
Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou shalt throw done mine
enemies under me.
Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me: and I shall
destroy them that hate me.
They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them: yea, even unto the Lord
shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.
I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I will cast them out as the
clay in the streets.
Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people: and thou shalt make me
the head of the heathen.
A people whom I have not known: shall serve me.
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: but the strange children shall
dissemble with me.
The strange children shall fail: and be afraid out of their prisons.
The Lord liveth, and blessed be my strong helper: and praised be the Lord of my
salvation.
Even the God that seeth that I be avenged: and subdueth the people unto me.
It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine
adversaries: thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.
For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles: and sing
praises unto thy Name.
Great prosperity giveth he unto his King: and showeth loving-kindness unto
David his Anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.

<h3>Psalm 18</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament showeth his
handiwork.
One day telleth another: and one night certifieth another.
There is neither speech nor language: but their voices are heard among them.
Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words into the ends of the world.
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun: which cometh forth as a
bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.
It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the
end of it again: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, converting the soul: the testimony of the
Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: the commandment of
the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever: the judgments of the Lord
are true, and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also
than honey, and the honey-comb.
Moreover, by them is thy servant taught: and in keeping of them there is great
reward.
Who can tell how oft he offendeth: O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.
Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion over
me: so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart: be alway
acceptable in thy sight,
O Lord: my strength, and my redeemer.
<h3>Psalm 19</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the Name of the God of Jacob defend
thee;
Send thee help from the sanctuary: and strengthen thee out of Sion;
Remember all thy offerings: and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
Grant thee thy heart's desire: and fulfil all thy mind.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God:
the Lord perform all thy petitions.
Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Anointed, and will hear him from his holy
heaven: even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.
Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the
Name of the Lord our God.
They are brought down, and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, Lord and hear us, O King of heaven: when we call upon thee.
<h3>Psalm 20</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be of thy
salvation.
Thou hast given him his heart's desire: and hast not denied him the request of
his lips.
For thou shalt prevent him with the blessings of goodness: and shalt set a crown
of pure gold upon his head.
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life: even for ever and ever.
His honour is great in thy salvation: glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon
him.
For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity: and make him glad with the joy of thy
countenance.
And why? because the King putteth his trust in the Lord: and in the mercy of the
most Highest he shall not miscarry.
All thine enemies shall feel thine hand: thy right hand shall find out them that
hate thee.
Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: the Lord shall
destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.
Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth: and their seed from among the
children of men.
For they intended mischief against thee: and imagined such a device as they are
not able to perform.
Therefore shalt thou put them to flight: and the strings of thy bow shalt thou
make ready against the face of them.
Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so we will sing, and praise thy
power.

<h3>Psalm 21</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the morning aid.
MY GOD, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me: and art so far from
my health, and from the words of my complaint?
O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not: and in the night-season
also I take no rest.
And thou continuest holy: O thou worship of Israel.
Our fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them.
They called upon thee, and were holpen: they put their trust in thee, and were
not confounded.
But as for me, I am a worm, and no man: a very scorn of men, and the outcast of
the people.
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot our their lips, and shake their
heads, saying,
He trusted in God, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, if he will have
him.
But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: thou wast my hope, when
I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.
I have been left unto thee ever since I was born: thou art my God, even from my
mother's womb.
O go not from me, for trouble is hard at hand: and there is none to help me.
Many oxen are come about me: fat bulls of Basan close me in on every side.
They gape upon me with their mouths: as it were a ramping and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart also in the
midst of my body is even like melting wax.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my gums: and
thou shalt bring me into the dust of death.
For many dogs are come about me: and the council of the wicked layeth siege
against me.
They pierced my hands and my feet; I may tell all my bones: they stand staring
and looking upon me.
They part my garments among them: and casts lots upon my vesture.
But be not thou far from me, O Lord: thou art my succour, haste thee to help me.
Deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth: thou hast heard me also from among the horns of
the unicorns.
I will declare thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I
praise thee.
O praise the Lord, ye that fear him: magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob, and
fear him, all ye seed of Israel.
For he hath not despised, nor abhorred, the low estate of the poor: he hath not
hid his face from him, but when he called unto him he heard him.
My praise is of thee in the great congregation: my vows will I perform in the
sight of them that fear him.
The poor shall eat and be satisfied: they that seek after the Lord shall praise him;
your heart shall live for ever.
All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned unto the
Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him.
For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the Governor among the people.
All such as be fat upon earth: have eaten and worshipped.
All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him: and no man hath
quickened his own soul.
My seed shall serve him: they shall be counted unto the Lord for a generation.
They shall come, and the heavens shall declare his righteousness: unto a people
that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.
<h3>Psalm 22</h3>
A psalm of David
THE Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside the waters of
comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness, for
his Name's sake.
Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort me.
Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble me: thou hast
anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.
But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
<h3>Psalm 23</h3>
A psalm of David on the first day of the week
THE earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and
they that dwell therein.
For he hath founded it upon the seas: and prepared it upon the floods.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall rise up in his holy place?
Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart: and that hath not lift up his
mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord: and righteousness from the God of
his salvation.
This is the generation of them that seek him: even of them that seek thy face, O
Jacob.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: it is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty
in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: even the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.

<h3>Psalm 24</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my trust in thee: O
let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.
For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed: but such as transgress
without a cause shall be put to confusion.
Shew me thy ways, O Lord: and teach me thy paths.
Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God of my salvation; in
thee hath been my hope all the day long.
Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender mercies: and thy loving-kindnesses,
which have been ever of old.
O remember not the sins and offences of my youth: but according to thy mercy
think thou upon me, O Lord, for thy goodness.
Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Them that are meek shall he guide in judgement: and such as are gentle, them
shall he learn his way.
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth: unto such as keep his covenant
and his testimonies.
For thy Name's sake, O Lord: be merciful unto my sin, for it is great.
What man is he that feareth the Lord: him shall he teach in the way that he shall
choose.
His soul shall dwell at ease: and his seed shall inherit the land.
The secret of the Lord is among them that fear him: and he will show them his
covenant.
Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out of the
net.
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am desolate and in misery.
The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my troubles.
Look upon my adversity and misery: and forgive me all my sin.
Consider mine enemies, how many they are: and they bear a tyrannous hate
against me.
O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be confounded, for I have put my
trust in thee.
Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me: for my hope hath been in
thee.
Deliver Israel, O God: out of all his troubles.
<h3>Psalm 25</h3>
A psalm of David
BE THOU my judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently: my trust hath been
also in the Lord, therefore shall I not fall.
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me: try out my reins and my heart.
For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes: and I will walk in thy truth.
I have not dwelt with vain persons: neither will I have fellowship with the
deceitful.
I have hated the congregation of the wicked: and will not sit among the ungodly.
I will wash my hands in innocency, O Lord: and so will I go to thine altar.
That I may show the voice of thanksgiving: and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house: and the place where thine honour
dwelleth.
O shut not up my soul with the sinners: nor my life with the blood-thirsty.
In whose hands is wickedness: and their right hand is full of gifts.
But as for me, I will walk innocently: O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.
My foot standeth right: I will praise the Lord in the congregations.
<h3>Psalm 26</h3>
A psalm of David before he was anointed
THE Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom then shall I fear: the Lord is the
strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my
flesh: they stumbled and fell.
Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid:
and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.
One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may dwell
in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of
the Lord, and to visit his temple.
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle: yea, in the secret
place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone.
And now shall he lift up mine head: above mine enemies round about me.
Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness: I will sing,
and speak praises unto the Lord.
Hearken unto my voice, O Lord, when I cry unto thee: have mercy upon me, and
hear me.
My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: Thy face, Lord, will I seek.
O hide not thou thy face from me: nor cast thy servant away in displeasure.
Thou hast been my succour: leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me: the Lord taketh me up.
Teach me the way, O Lord: and lead in the right way, because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: for there are false
witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.
I should utterly have fainted: but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the
Lord in the land of the living.
O tarry thou the Lord's leisure: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart ; and
put thou thy trust in the Lord.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 27</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee will I cry, O Lord my strength: think no scorn of me; lest, if thou
make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go down into the
pit.
Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee: when I hold up my
hands towards the mercy-seat of thy holy temple.
O pluck me not away, neither destroy me, with the ungodly and wicked doers:
which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mischief in their
hearts.
Reward them according to their deeds: and according to the wickedness of their
own inventions.
Recompense them after the work of their hands: pay them that they have
deserved.
For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his
hands: therefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.
Praised be the Lord: for he hath heard the voice of my humble petitions.
The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and I am
helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise
him.
The Lord is my strength: and he is the wholesome defence of his Anointed.
O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: feed them , and
set them up for ever.
<h3>Psalm 28</h3>
A psalm of David on the occasion of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle
BRING unto the Lord, O ye mighty, bring young rams unto the Lord: ascribe unto
the Lord worship and strength.
Give the Lord the honour due unto his Name: worship the Lord with holy
worship.
It is the Lord that commandeth the waters: it is the glorious God that maketh the
thunder.
It is the Lord that ruleth the sea; the voice of the Lord is mighty in operation: the
voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar-trees: yea, the Lord breaketh the
cedars of Libanus.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf: Libanus also, and Sirion, like a young
unicorn.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the Lord shaketh
the wilderness: yea, the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Cades.
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and discovereth the
thick bushes: in his temple doth every man speak of his honour.
The Lord sitteth above the water -flood: and the Lord remaineth a King for ever.
The Lord shall give strength unto his people: the Lord shall give his people the
blessing of peace.
<h3>Psalm 29</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song at the dedication of the house of David
I WILL magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up: and not made my foes to
triumph over me.
O Lord my God, I cried unto thee: and thou hast healed me.
Thou, Lord, hast brought my soul out of hell: thou hast kept my life from them
that go down to the pit.
Sing praises unto the Lord, O ye saints of his: and give thanks unto him for a
remembrance of his holiness.
For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his pleasure is life:
heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: thou, Lord, of thy
goodness hast made my hill so strong.
Thou didst turn thy face from me: and I was troubled.
Then cried I unto thee, O Lord: and gat me to my Lord right humbly.
What profit is there in my blood: when I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust give thanks unto thee: or shall it declare thy truth?
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.
Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and
girded me with gladness.
Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing: O my God, I
will give thanks unto thee for ever.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 30</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David; an utterance of extreme fear
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion, deliver
me in thy righteousness.
Bow down thine ear to me: make haste to deliver me.
And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence: that thou mayest save me.
For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: be thou also my guide, and lead me
for thy Name's sake.
Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my
strength.
Into thy hands I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou
God of truth.
I have hated them that hold of superstitious vanities: and my trust hath been in
the Lord.
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble, and
hast known my soul in adversities.
Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: but hast set my feet in a
large room.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord , for I am in trouble: and mine eye is consumed for
very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.
For my life is waxen old with heaviness: and my years with mourning.
My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity: and my bones are consumed.
I became a reproof among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours: and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me; and they
that did see me without conveyed themselves from me.
I am clean forgotten, as a dead man out of mind: I am become like a broken
vessel.
For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude: and fear is on every side, while
they conspire together against me, and take their counsel to take away my
life.
But my hope hath been in thee, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my God.
My time is in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies: and from
them that persecute me.
Shew thy servant the light of thy countenance: and save me for thy mercy's sake.
Let me not be confounded, O Lord for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be
put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.
Let the lying lips be put to silence: which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully,
speak against the righteous.
O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee:
and that thou hast prepared for them that put their trust in thee, even
before the sons of men!
Thou shalt hide them privily by thine own presence from the provoking of all
men: thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle from the strife of
tongues.
Thanks be to the Lord: for he hath shewed me marvellous great kindness in a
strong city.
And when I made haste, I said: I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.
Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer: when I cried unto thee.
26.O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth them that are
faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.
Be strong, and he shall establish your heart: all that ye put your trust in the
Lord.
<h3>Psalm 31</h3>
A psalm of instruction by David
BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven: and whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no sin: and in whose spirit
there is no guile.
For while I held my tongue: my bones consumed away through my daily
complaining.
For thy hand is heavy upon me day and night: and my moisture is like the
drought in summer.
I will acknowledge my sin unto thee: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.
I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord: and so thou forgavest the wickedness
of my sin.
For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a time when
thou mayest be found: but in the great water-floods they shall not come
nigh him.
Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shalt preserve me from trouble: thou shalt
compass me about with songs of deliverance.
I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go: and I will
guide thee with mine eyes.
Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding: whose mouths
must be held with bit and bridle. lest they fall upon thee.
Great plagues remain for the ungodly: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord,
mercy embraceth him on every side.
Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord: and be joyful, all ye that are true
of heart.

<h3>Psalm 32</h3>
A psalm of David
REJOICE in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to be thankful.
Praise the Lord with harp: sing praises unto him with the lute, and instrument of
ten strings.
Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing praises lustily unto him with a good
courage.
For the word of the Lord is true: and all his works are faithful.
He loveth righteousness and judgement: the earth is full of the goodness of the
Lord.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the hosts of them by the
breath of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap: and layeth
up the deep, as in a treasure-house.
Let all the earth fear the Lord: stand in awe of him, all ye that dwell in the world.
For he spake, and it was done: he commanded and it stood fast.
The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: and maketh the devices
of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the counsels of princes.
The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever: and the thoughts of his heart from
generation to generation.
Blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord Jehovah: and blessed are the folk,
that he hath chosen to him to be his inheritance.
The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the children of men: from the
habitation of his dwelling he considereth all them that dwell on the earth.
He fashioneth all the hearts of them: and understandeth all their works.
There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host: neither is any
mighty man delivered by much strength.
A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man: neither shall he deliver any
man by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him: and upon them that put
their trust in his mercy.
To deliver their soul from death: and to feed them in the time of dearth.
Our soul hath patiently tarried for the Lord: for he is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in him: because we have hoped in his holy Name.
Let thy merciful kindness, O Lord, be upon us: like as we do put our trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 33</h3>
A psalm of David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech, and he was dismissed
and departed
I WILL alway give thanks unto the Lord: his praise shall ever be in my mouth.
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be
glad.
O praise the Lord with me: and let us magnify his Name together.
I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he delivered me out of all my fear.
They had an eye unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
ashamed.
Lo, the poor crieth, and the Lord heareth him: yea, and saveth him out of all his
troubles.
The angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him: and delivereth
them.
O taste, and see, how gracious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusteth in
him.
O fear the Lord, ye that are his saints: for they that fear him lack nothing.
The lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they who seek the Lord shall want no
manner of thing that is good.
Come, ye children, and hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
What man is he that lusteth to live: and would fain see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil: and thy lips, that they speak no guile.
Eschew evil, and do good: seek peace, and ensue it.
The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous: and his ears are open unto their
prayers.
The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil: to root out the
remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them: and delivereth them out of all
their troubles.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and will save such as be
of an humble spirit.
Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of all.
He keepeth all his bones: so that not one of them is broken.
But misfortune shall slay the ungodly: and they that hate the righteous shall be
desolate.
The Lord delivereth the souls of his servants: and all they that put their trust in
him shall not be destitute.

<h3>Psalm 34</h3>
A psalm of David
PLEAD thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: and fight thou
against them that fight against me.
Lay hand upon the shield and buckler: and stand up to help me.
Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto
my soul, I am thy salvation.
Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seek after my soul :let them be
turned back and brought to confusion, that imagine mischief for me.
Let them be as the dust before the wind: and the angel of the Lord scattering
them.
Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord persecute them.
For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause: yea, even
without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.
Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net, that he hath laid
privily, catch himself: that he may fall into his own mischief.
And, my soul, be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, who deliverest the poor from
him that is too strong for him: yea, the poor, and him that is in misery, from
him that spoileth him?
False witnesses did rise up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
They rewarded me evil for good: to the great discomfort of my soul.
Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with
fasting.: and my prayer shall turn into mine own bosom.
I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother: I went heavily,
as one that mourneth for his mother.
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the
very abjects came together against me unawares, making mouths at me,
and ceased not.
With the flatterers were busy mockers: who gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, how long wilt though look upon this: O deliver my soul from the calamities
which they bring on me, and my darling from the lions.
So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among
much people.
O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly: neither let them
wink with their eyes that they hate me without a cause.
And why? their communing is not for peace; but they imagine deceitful words
against them that are quiet in the land.
They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said: Fie on thee, fie on thee, we
saw it with our eyes.
This thou hast seen, O Lord: hold not thy tongue then, go not far from me, O
Lord.
Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel: avenge thou my cause, my God, and
my Lord.
Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness: and let them not
triumph over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, There, there, so would we have it: neither let
them say, We have devoured him.
Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at my trouble: let
them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that boast themselves against
me.
Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing: yea, let them say
alway, Blessed be the Lord, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
servant.
And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness: and of thy praise
all the day long.
<h3>Psalm 35</h3>
For the end. By David the servant of the Lord
MY HEART sheweth me the wickedness of the ungodly: that there is no fear of
God before his eyes.
For he flattereth himself in his own sight: until his abominable sin be found out.
The words of his mouth are unrighteous, and full of deceit: he hath left off to
behave himself wisely, and to do good.
He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good way:
neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.
Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth unto the heavens: and thy faithfulness unto the
clouds.
Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: thy judgments are like the
great deep.
Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast; How excellent is thy mercy, O God:
and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy
wings.
They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house: and thou shalt give
them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.
For with thee is the well of life: and in thy light shall we see light.
O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee: and thy
righteousness unto them that are true of heart.
O let not the foot of pride come against me: and let not the hand of the ungodly
cast me down.
There are they fallen, all that work wickedness: they are cast down, and shall not
be able to stand.

<h3>Psalm 36</h3>
A psalm of David
FRET not thyself because of the ungodly: neither be thou envious against the
evil-doers.
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass: and be withered even as the
green herb.
Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good: dwell in the land, and verily
thou shalt be fed.
Delight thou in the Lord: and he shall give thee thy heart's desire.
Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him: and he shall bring it to
pass.
He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light ; and thy just dealing as the
noon-day.
Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon him: but grieve not thyself at
him whose way doth prosper, against the man that doeth after evil
counsels.
Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: fret not thyself, else shalt thou be
moved to do evil.
Wicked doers shall be rooted out: and they that patiently abide the Lord, those
shall inherit the land.
Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: thou shalt look after his
place, and he shall be away.
But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth: and shall be refreshed in the
multitude of peace.
The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just: and gnasheth upon him with his
teeth.
The Lord shall laugh him to scorn: for he hath seen that his day is coming.
The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow: to cast down
the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of a right conversation.
Their sword shall go through their own heart: and their bow shall be broken.
A small thing that the righteous hath: is better than great riches of the ungodly.
For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken: and the Lord upholdeth the
righteous.
The Lord knoweth the days of the godly: and their inheritance shall endure for
ever.
They shall not be confounded in the perilous time: and in the days of dearth they
shall have enough.
As for the ungodly, they shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord shall consume
as the fat of lambs: yea, even as the smoke shall they consume away.
The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous is merciful and
liberal.
Such as are blessed of God shall possess the land: and they that are cursed of
him shall be rooted out.
The Lord ordereth a good man's going: and maketh his way acceptable to
himself.
Though he fall, he shall not be cast away: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
hand.
I have been young, and now am old: and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging their bread.
The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth: and his seed is blessed.
Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good: and dwell for evermore.
For the Lord loveth the thing that is right: he forsaketh not his that be godly, but
they are preserved for ever.
The unrighteous shall be punished: as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be
rooted out.
The righteous shall inherit the land: and dwell therein forever.
The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and his tongue will be talking
of judgement.
The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not slide.
The ungodly seeth the righteous: and seeketh occasion to slay him.
The Lord will not leave him in his hand: nor condemn him when he is judged.
Hope thou in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee, that thou
shalt possess the land: when the ungodly shall perish, thou shalt see it.
I myself have seen the ungodly in great power: and flourishing like a green baytree.
I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him, but his place could no where be
found.
Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right: for that shall bring a
man peace at the last.
As for the transgressors, they shall perish together: and the end of the ungodly
is, they shall be rooted out at the last.
But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord: who is also their strength
in the time of trouble.
And the Lord shall stand by them, and save them: he shall deliver them from the
ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him.

<h3>Psalm 37</h3>
A psalm of David . For remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day
PUT me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy heavy
displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me: and thy hand presseth me sore.
There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure: neither is there any
rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.
For my wickednesses are gone over my head: and are like a sore burden, too
heavy for me to bear.
My wounds stink, and are corrupt: through my foolishness.
I am brought into so great trouble and misery: that I go mourning all the day
long.
For my loins are filled with a sore disease: and there is no whole part in my body.
I am feeble, and sore smitten: I have roared for the very disquietness of my
heart.
Lord, thou knowest all my desire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me: and the sight of mine eyes is gone
from me.
My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble: and my
kinsmen stood afar off.
They also that sought after my life laid snares for me: and they that went about
to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit all the day long.
As for me I was like a deaf men, and heard not: and as one that is dumb, who
doth not open his mouth.
I became even as a man that heareth not: and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my
God.
I have required that they, even mine enemies should not triumph over me: for
when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me.
And I, truly, am set in the plague: and my heaviness is ever in my sight.
For I will confess my wickedness: and be sorry for my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are mighty: and they that hate me wrongfully are
many in number.
They also that reward evil for good are against me: because I follow the thing
that good is.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me.
Haste thee to help me: O Lord God of my salvation.
<h3>Psalm 38</h3>
For the end. A song of David, for Idithun
I SAID, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not in my tongue.
I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle: while the ungodly is in my sight.
I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even from good words;
but it was pain and grief to me.
My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire kindled: and at
the last I spake with my tongue;
Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may be certified
how long I have to live.
Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long: and mine age is even as
nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is altogether vanity.
For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth
up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.
And now, Lord, what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.
Deliver me from all mine offences: and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.
I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.
Take thy plague away from me: I am even consumed by the means of thy heavy
hand.
When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to
consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man
therefore is but vanity.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling: hold not thy
peace at my tears.
For I am a stranger with thee: and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence, and be no
more seen
<h3>Psalm 39</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
I WAITED patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and heard my calling.
He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay: and set my
feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth: even a thanksgiving unto our God.
Many shall see it, and fear: and shall put their trust in the Lord.
Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the Lord: and turned not unto the
proud, and to such as go about with lies.
O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like as be
also thy thoughts which are to us-ward: and yet there is no man that
ordereth them unto thee:
If I should declare them, and speak of them: they should be more than I am able
to express.
Sacrifice and meat-offering thou wouldest not: but mine ears hast thou opened.
Burnt-offerings, and sacrifice for sin, hast thou not required: then said I, Lo, I
come,
In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil thy will, O my
God: I am content to do it; yea, thy law is within my heart.
I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I will not refrain
my lips, O Lord, and that thou knowest.
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart: my talk hath been of thy truth
and of thy salvation.
I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth: from the great congregation.
Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord: let thy loving-kindness and thy
truth alway preserve me.
For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such hold upon
me that I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the
hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.
O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me: make haste, O Lord, to help me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after my soul to
destroy it: let them be driven backward and put to rebuke, that wish me
evil.
Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame: that say unto me, Fie upon
thee, fie upon thee.
Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let such as love thy
salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and needy: but the Lord careth for me.
Thou art my helper and redeemer: make no long tarrying, O my God.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 40</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him
in the time of trouble.
The Lord preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth:
and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.
The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick upon his bed: make thou all his bed in
his sickness.
I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies speak evil of me: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: and his heart conceiveth falsehood
within himself, and when he cometh forth he telleth it.
All mine enemies whisper together against me: even against me do they imagine
this evil.
Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him: and now that he lieth, let him
rise up no more.
Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted: who did also eat of my
bread, hath laid great wait for me.
But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord: raise thou me up again, and I shall reward
them.
By this I know thou favourest me: that mine enemy doth not triumph against me.
And when I am in my health, thou upholdest me: and shalt set me before thy face
for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: world without end. Amen.
<h3>Psalm 41</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: when shall I come to
appear before the presence of God?
My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where
is now thy God?
Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the
multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;
In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day.
Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted
within me?
Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his
countenance.
My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore will I remember thee concerning
the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermon.
One deep calleth another, because of the noise of the water-pipes: all thy waves
and storms are gone over me.
The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time: and in the nightseason did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me: why go I
thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword: while mine enemies that trouble
me cast me in the teeth;
Namely, while they say daily unto me: Where is now thy God?
Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.
<h3>Psalm 42</h3>
A psalm of David
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people:
O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.
For thou art the God of my strength, why hast thou put me from thee: and why
go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me: and bring me unto thy
holy hill, and to thy dwelling.
And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and
gladness: and upon the harp I will give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 43</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
WE HAVE heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us: what thou hast
done in their time of old;
How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted them in: how
thou hast destroyed the nations and cast them out.
For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword: neither was it
their own arm that helped them;
But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance: because
thou hadst a favour unto them.
Thou art my King, O God: send help unto Jacob.
Through thee will we overthrow our enemies: and in thy Name will we tread
them under, that rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow: it is not my sword that shall help me;
But it is thou that savest us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion that
hate us.
We make our boast of God all day long: and will praise thy Name for ever.
But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion: and goest not forth with our
armies.
Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies: so that they which hate us
spoil our goods.
Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep: and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Thou sellest thy people for nought: and takest no money for them.
Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours: to be laughed to scorn, and had
in derision of them that are round about us.
Thou makest us to be a by-word among the heathen: and that the people shake
their heads at us.
My confusion is daily before me: and the shame of my face hath covered me;
For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer: for the enemy and avenger.
And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee: nor behave
ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.
Our heart is not turned back: neither our steps gone out of thy way;
No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons: and covered us with
the shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to any
strange God: shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very secrets of
the heart.
For thy sake also are we killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep
appointed to be slain.
Up, Lord, why sleepest thou: awake, and be not absent from us for ever.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face: and forgettest our misery and trouble?
For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
ground.
Arise, and help us: and deliver us for thy mercy's sake.
<h3>Psalm 44</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses by the sons of Core, for instruction. A Song concerning the
beloved
MY HEART is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the thing which I have made
unto the King.
My tongue is the pen: of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, because God
hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most Mighty: according to thy
worship and renown.
Good luck have thou with thine honour: ride on, because of the word of truth , of
meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible
things.
Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be subdued unto thee: even in
the midst among the King's enemies.
Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, even thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia: out of the ivory palaces,
whereby they have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did
stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, incline thine ear ; forget also thine own
people, and thy father's house.
So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty: for his is thy Lord God, and
worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: like as the rich also among
the people shall make their supplication before thee.
The King's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work: the virgins that be
her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee.
With joy and gladness shall they be brought: and shall enter into the King's
palace.
Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children: whom thou mayest make princes
in all lands.
I will remember thy Name from one generation to another: therefore shall the
people give thanks unto thee, world without end.
<h3>Psalm 45</h3>
For the end. For the sons of Core; a psalm concerning secret things
GOD is our hope and strength: a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved: and though the hills be
carried into the midst of the sea;
Though the waters thereof rage and swell: and though the mountains shake at
the tempest of the same.
The rivers of the flood thereof shall make glad the city of God: the holy place of
the tabernacle of the most Highest.
God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed: God shall help
her, and that right early.
The heathen make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved: but God hath shewed
his voice, and the earth shall melt away.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.
O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord: what destruction he hath
brought upon the earth.
He maketh wars to cease in all the world: he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the
spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.
Be still then, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I
will be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

<h3>Psalm 46</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O CLAP your hand together, all ye people: O sing unto God with the voice of
melody.
For the Lord is high, and to be feared: he is the great King upon all the earth.
He shall subdue the people under us: and the nations under our feet.
He shall choose out an heritage for us: even the worship of Jacob, whom he
loved.
God is gone up with a merry noise: and the Lord with the sound of the trump.
O sing praises, sing praises unto our God: O sing praises, sing praises unto our
King.
For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon his holy seat.
The princes of the people are joined unto the people of the God of Abraham: for
God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the earth, as it were with a
shield.
<h3>Psalm 47</h3>
A psalm of praise for the sons of Core on the second day of the week
GREAT is the Lord, and highly to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his
holy hill.
The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth: upon the north-side
lieth the city of the great King; God is well known in her palaces as a sure
refuge.
For lo, the kings of the earth: are gathered, and gone by together.
They marvelled to see such things: they were astonished, and suddenly cast
down.
Fear came there upon them, and sorrow: as upon a woman in her travail.
Thou shalt break the ships of the sea: through the east wind.
Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the
city of our God: God upholdeth the same for ever.
We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God: in the midst of thy temple.
O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's end: thy right
hand is full of righteousness.
Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad: because of thy
judgements.
Walk about Sion, and go round about her: and tell the towers thereof.
Mark well her bulwarks, set up her houses: that ye may tell them that come
after.
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he shall be our guide unto death.
<h3>Psalm 48</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O HEAR ye this, all ye people: ponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the
world;
High and low, rich and poor: one with another.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom: and my heart shall muse of understanding.
I will incline mine ear to the parable: and shew my dark speech upon the harp.
Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness: and when the wickedness of
my heels compasseth me round about?
There be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches.
But no man may deliver his brother: nor make agreement unto God for him;
For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that alone for ever;
Yea, though he live long: and see not the grave.
For he seeth that wise men also die, and perish together: as well as the ignorant
and foolish, and leave their riches for other.
And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever: and that their
dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the
lands after their own names.
Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour: seeing that he may be compared
unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them.
This is their foolishness: and their posterity praise their saying.
They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and the righteous shall
have domination over them in the morning: their beauty shall consume in
the sepulchre out of their dwelling.
But God hath delivered my soul from the place of hell: for he shall receive me.
Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich: or if the glory of his house be
increased.
For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth: neither shall his pomp
follow him.
For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man: and so long as thou doest
well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.
He shall follow the generation of his fathers: and shall never see light.
Man being in honour hath no understanding: but is compared unto the beasts
that perish.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 49</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
THE Lord, even the most mighty God, hath spoken: and called the world, from
the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Out of Sion hath God appeared: in perfect beauty.
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: there shall go before him a
consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up round about him.
He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth, that he may judge his people.
Gather my saints together unto me: those that have made a covenant with me
with sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is Judge himself.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak: I myself will testify against thee, O Israel;
for I am God, even thy God.
I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt-offerings:
because they were not alway before me.
I will take no bullock out of thine house: nor he-goat out of thy folds.
For all the beasts of the forest are mine: and so are the cattle upon a thousand
hills.
I know all the fowls upon the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are in
my sight.
If I be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the whole world is mine, and all that is
therein.
Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh: and drink the blood of goats?
Offer unto God thanksgiving: and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.
And call upon me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise
me.
But unto the ungodly said God: Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my
covenant in thy mouth;
Whereas thou hatest to be reformed: and has cast my words behind thee?
When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him: and hast been partaker
with the adulterers.
Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness: and with thy tongue thou hast set
forth deceit.
Thou satest, and spakest against thy brother: yea, and hast slandered thine own
mother's son.
These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest
wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and
set before thee the things that thou hast done.
O consider this, ye that forget God: lest I pluck you away, and there be none to
deliver you.
Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation right will I shew the salvation of God.
<h3>Psalm 50</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to
Bathsheba
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according to the
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.
Wash me throughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.
Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin hath my mother conceived me.
But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand
wisdom secretly.
Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice.
Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.
Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health: and
my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.
Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy praise.
For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou delightest not in
burnt-offerings.
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt
thou not despise.
O be favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burntofferings and oblations: then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine
altar.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 51</h3>
For the end. A psalm of instruction by David, when Doeg the Idumean came and told Saul that
David had gone to the house of Abimelech
WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant: that thou canst do mischief;
Whereas the goodness of God: endureth yet daily?
Thy tongue imagineth wickedness: and with lies thou cuttest like a sharp rasor.
Thou hast loved unrighteousness more then goodness: and to talk of lies more
than righteousness.
Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt: O thou false tongue.
Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever: he shall take thee, and pluck thee out
of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of the living.
The righteous also shall see this, and fear: and shall laugh him to scorn;
Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength: but trusted unto the
multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: my trust is in the
tender mercy of God for ever and ever.
I will always give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done: and I will hope in thy
Name, for thy saints like it well.
<h3>Psalm 52</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David upon Maeleth, of instruction
THE foolish body hath said in his heart: There is no God.
Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness: there is none that
doeth good.
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there were any
that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is also none that doeth good, no not one.
Are not they without understanding, that work wickedness: eating up my people
as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.
They were afraid where no fear was: for God hath broken the bones of him that
besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because God hath despised
them.
O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion: O that the Lord would
deliver his people out of captivity!
Then should Jacob rejoice: and Israel should be right glad.
<h3>Psalm 53</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of instruction by David. When the Ziphites came and said to Saul,
Lo, is not David hid with us?
SAVE me, O God, for thy Name's sake: and avenge me in thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God: and hearken unto the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me: and tyrants, which have not God before
their eyes, seek after my soul.
Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy truth.
An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O Lord: because
it is so comfortable.
For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire
upon mine enemies.
<h3>Psalm 54</h3>
For the end. Among hymns of instruction by David
HEAR my prayer, O God: and hide not thyself from my petition.
Take heed unto me, and hear me: how I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed.
The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast: for they are minded to
do me some mischief; so maliciously are they set against me.
My heart is disquieted within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me: and an horrible dread hath
overwhelmed me.
And I said, O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I flee away, and be at
rest.
Lo, then would I get me away far off: and remain in the wilderness.
I would make haste to escape: because of the stormy wind and tempest.
Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them: for I have spied unrighteousness
and strife in the city.
Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow
are in the midst of it.
Wickedness is therein: deceit and guile go not out of their streets.
For it is not an open enemy, that hath done me this dishonour: for then I could
have borne it.
Neither was it mine adversary, that did magnify himself against me: for then
peradventure I would have hid myself from him.
But it was even thou, my companion: my guide, and mine own familiar friend.
We took sweet counsel together: and walked in the house of God as friends.
Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for
wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord shall save me.
In the evening, and morning, and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly: and
he shall hear my voice.
It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
for there were many with me.
Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them down: for
they will not turn, nor fear God.
He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him: and he brake his covenant.
The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart: his
words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very swords.
O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: and shall not suffer
the righteous to fall for ever.
And as for them: thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction.
The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days:
nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.

<h3>Psalm 55</h3>
For the end. Concerning the people that were removed from the sanctuary. By David for a
memorial, when the Philistines caught him in Gath
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me: he is daily
fighting, and troubling me.
Mine enemies are daily in hand to swallow me up: for they be many that fight
against me, O thou most Highest.
Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid: yet put I my trust in thee.
I will praise God, because of his word: I have put my trust in God, and will not
fear what flesh can do unto me.
They daily mistake my words: all that they imagine is to do me evil.
They hold all together, and keep themselves close: and mark my steps, when
they lay wait for my soul.
Shall they escape for their wickedness: thou, O God, in thy displeasure shalt cast
them down.
Thou tellest my flittings; put my tears into thy bottle: are not these things noted
in thy book?
Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight: this I
know; for God is on my side.
In God's word I will rejoice: in the Lord's word will I comfort me.
Yea, in God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows: unto thee will I give thanks.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling: that I may
walk before God in the light of the living.
<h3>Psalm 56</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David, for a memorial. When he fled from the presence of Saul to
the cave
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, be merciful unto me, for my soul trusteth in
thee: and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until this
tyranny be over-past.
I will call unto the most high God: even unto the God that shall perform the
cause which I have in hand.
He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him that would eat
me up.
God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among lions.
And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are
spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they have digged a
pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, and give praise.
Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee
among the nations.
For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens: and thy truth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 57</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation: and do ye judge the
thing that is right, O ye sons of men?
Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth: and your hands deal with
wickedness.
The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb: as soon as they are
born, they go astray, and speak lies.
They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent: even like the deaf adder that
stoppeth her ears.
Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer: charm he never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; smite the jaw-bones of the lions, O
Lord: let them fall away like water that runneth apace; and when they
shoot their arrows let them be rooted out.
Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of a woman:
and let them not see the sun.
Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns: so let indignation vex him, even as a
thing that is raw.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his
footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: doubtless
there is a God that judgeth the earth.

<h3>Psalm 58</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David for a memorial, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill
him
DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God: defend me from them that rise up
against me.
O deliver me from the wicked doers: and save me from the blood-thirsty men.
For lo, they lie waiting for my soul: the mighty men are gathered against me,
without any offence or fault of me, O Lord.
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: arise thou therefore to help
me, and behold.
Stand up, O Lord God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the heathen: and be
not merciful unto them that offend of malicious wickedness.
They go to and fro in the evening: they grin like a dog, and run about through the
city.
Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips: for who doth
hear?
But thou. O Lord, shalt have them in derision: and thou shalt laugh all the
heathen to scorn.
My strength will I ascribe unto thee: for thou art the God of my refuge.
God sheweth me his goodness plenteously: and God shall let me see my desire
upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget it: but scatter them abroad among the
people, and put them down, O Lord, our defence.
For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be taken in
their pride: and why? their preaching is of cursing and lies.
Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish: and know that
it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.
And in the evening they will return: grin like a dog, and will go about the city.
They will run here and there for meat: and grudge if they be not satisfied.
As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betimes in the
morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
trouble.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my
merciful God.
<h3>Psalm 59</h3>
For the end. For them that shall yet be changed. For an inscription by David for instruction.
When he had burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syrian Sobal, and Joab had returned and smitten
twelve thousand in the Valley of Salt
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad: thou hast also been
displeased; O turn thee unto us again.
Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: heal the sores thereof, for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewed thy people heavy things: thou hast given us a drink of deadly
wine.
Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee: that they may triumph because of
the truth.
Therefore were thy beloved delivered: help me with thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Sichem: and mete out
the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head;
Judah is my law-giver.
Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, be thou glad
of me.
Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou cast us out, O God: wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
O be thou our help in trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Through God will we do great acts: for it is he that shall tread down our enemies.
<h3>Psalm 60</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of David
HEAR my crying, O God: give ear unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth will I call unto thee: when my heart is in heaviness.
O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I: for thou hast been my hope, and
a strong tower for me against the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: and my trust shall be under the covering of
thy wings.
For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires: and hast given an heritage unto those
that fear thy Name.
Thou shalt grant the King a long life: that his years may endure throughout all
generations.
He shall dwell before God for ever: O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness,
that they may preserve him.
So will I always sing praise unto thy Name: that I may daily perform my vows.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 61</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David for Idithun
MY SOUL truly waiteth still upon God: for of him cometh my salvation.
He verily is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
greatly fall.
How long will ye imagine mischief against every man: ye shall be slain all the
sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and like a broken hedge.
Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt: their delight is in
lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse with their heart.
Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God: for my hope is in him.
He truly is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
fall.
In God is my health, and my glory: the rock of my might, and in God is my trust.
O put your trust in him alway, ye people: pour out your hearts before him, for
God is our hope.
As for the children of men, they are but vanity: the children of men are deceitful
upon the weights, they are altogether lighter than vanity itself.
O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselves unto vanity: if riches
increase, set not your heart upon them.
God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same: that power belongeth
unto God;
And that thou, Lord, art merciful: for thou rewardest every man according to his
work.
<h3>Psalm 62</h3>
A psalm of David. When he was in the wilderness of Idumea
O GOD, thou art my God: early will I seek thee.
My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee: in a barren and dry
land where no water is.
Thus have I looked for thee in holiness: that I might behold thy power and glory.
For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: my lips shall praise thee.
As long as I live will I magnify thee on this manner: and lift up my hands in thy
Name.
My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness: when my
mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.
Have I not remembered thee in my bed: and thought upon thee when I was
waking?
Because thou hast been my helper: therefore under the shadow of thy wings will
I rejoice.
My soul hangeth upon thee: thy right hand hath upholden me.
These also that seek the hurt of my soul: they shall go under the earth.
Let them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be a portion for foxes.
But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him shall be
commended: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
<h3>Psalm 63</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the gathering together of the froward: and from the insurrection of
wicked doers;
Who have whet their tongue like a sword: and shoot out their arrows, even bitter
words;
That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: suddenly do they hit him, and
fear not.
They encourage themselves in mischief: and commune among themselves how
they may lay snares, and say that no man shall see them.
They imagine wickedness, and practise it: that they keep secret among
themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.
But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow: that they shall be
wounded.
Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall insomuch that whoso seeth them
shall laugh them to scorn.
And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done: for they shall perceive that
it is his work.
The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and put his trust in him: and all they that
are true of heart shall be glad.

Grant me fruits of repentance, O compassionate Christ, and save me. Heal the incurable sufferings of my heart, O Compassionate One, grant the severance of my debts, and ease my heavy burden, that in compunction I may ever glorify Thee, the God of our fathers. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Bound, beheaded, consumed by material fire, cast to the lions as food, stretched on the wheel, the divine and sacred spiritual athletes did not deny Thee, our living God. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye were parted from your bodies, yet were shown to be un-separated from God, O martyrs, because of your divine union with Him Who united Himself to us incorruptibly.

With thy hand thou didst point to the Lamb of God Who taketh away the sins of the world, O prophet. Him do thou ever beseech, that He take away my grievous offenses and difficult times, and grant me life. O my soul, hasten thou and, abandoning the darkness of irrational deeds, cry out: Have pity on me, O Jesus, through the supplications of the Baptist, and rescue me from the mire of my deeds! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Unto Him, before Whom the ranks of heaven stand with trembling, and Who in His goodness united Himself unto mankind, didst thou give birth, O pure one.

Having sinned more than David, I gaze upon the great mercy of Thy compassions, O Christ, and with him cry aloud: O only Merciful One, speedily have mercy upon me! I pray that mine end may be good, and that I may bring an end to my wicked deeds. Yet my intention is not sincere, for my heart is hardened. Have pity on me, O Word of God. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O passion-bearers, ye willingly offered yourselves as chosen and unblemished sacrifices unto the only-begotten Word Who sacrificed Himself for our sake, abolishing all the sacrifices of the demons. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The severing of your tendons, the uprooting of your teeth, the cutting off of your hands, the fracture of your members, and every other torture did ye valiantly endure, O martyrs, hymning Christ, the only Judge of the contest. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> For us thou hast given birth to the Ancient of days as a little babe, Who showeth us new paths on earth, renewing our nature which hath waxed old, O unwedded and blessed one. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Suffering affliction for the sake of the laws of their fathers, * the blessed Children in Babylon * scorned the foolish decree of the King. * Standing together in the midst of the flames, they remained unharmed, * and sang a song fitting for almighty God: * ‘O ye works of the Lord, praise ye the Lord * and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages.’ Thou didst behold the Holy Spirit descending in the form of a dove upon the Word as He was baptized, O blessed one, and wast deemed worthy to hear the voice of the Father, saying: “This is my Son, Who is co-enthroned with Me, to Whom all creation doth sing: Hymn the Lord, O ye works, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!” Having consumed the flammable passions of my mind with the fire of thy prayers, O prophet, light again the lamp of my heart, which hath gone out, that, seeing clearly, I may chant unto the Creator of the light of the commandments: Hymn the Lord, ye works, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! I am the wretched servant who hid the talant which I received from Thee to invest. What shall I do when Thou comest to render judgment, trying the deeds of each man? But have pity on me through the supplications of Thy Forerunner, and send me not into the fire who cry: Hymn the Lord, O ye works, and supremely exalt Him throughout the ages! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Maintain my mind in humility, O Maiden full of the grace of God, who by thy birthgiving hast crushed the uprising of the demons.

O Jesus Who lovest mankind, Thou alone knowest our infirmity, for in Thy tender compassion Thou didst clothe Thyself therein, desiring to cleanse it. Wherefore, cleanse my wicked defilements and the sores of mine evils, and save me. Like the harlot I offer Thee tears, O Lover of mankind; like the publican I cry out, groaning, unto Thee: Cleanse and save me! And like the Canaanite woman I exclaim: Have mercy on me, as Thou didst the penitent Peter, and grant me forgiveness! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Wrestling in the flesh with the incorporeal prince of this world, by your struggles of suffering ye cast him down, and have worthily received crowns of victory. Wherefore, pray ye earnestly for all who praise you with faith, O holy ones. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With the holy blood of Thy saints Thou didst sanctify the earth, O Lord, uniting their spirits to the spirits of the holy hosts, O most Holy One; and by them Thou dost ever sanctify those who hallow Thee with true faith. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> We offer unto thee the cry of the archangel, O all-pure and blessed one: Rejoice, thou who contained the uncontainable God!

Cure thou my mind, which hath been grievously infected by the love of life’s pleasures, still the tempest which vexeth me greatly, and show me the straight ways of repentance, O Forerunner of the Lord. Thou wast seen standing between the Old and the New Covenants, O prophet, causing the former to cease and revealing the latter as light. Quickly guide us to walk therein with a godly conscience, that we may be delivered from everlasting darkness. The dread judgment will be a day full of wrath, a day of darkness for those whose works are dark, O Baptist and Forerunner of Christ. By thy prayers deliver us from all condemnation then, for we honor thee. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thou wast shown to be holier than the cherubim, O Virgin, for thou hast given birth to the supremely holy God. Sanctify us all, who day and night hallow thee with holy voices and faith.

<h3>Psalm 64</h3>
For the end. A psalm and song of David
THOU, O God, art praised in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed in
Jerusalem.
Thou that hearest the prayer: unto thee shall all flesh come.
My misdeeds prevail against me: O be thou merciful unto our sins.
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: he shall dwell
in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house, even of
thy holy temple.
Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation: thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that remain in the broad sea.
Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains: and is girded about with power.
Who stilleth the raging of the sea: and the noise of his waves, and the madness of
the people.
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afraid at thy
tokens: thou that makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
praise thee.
Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very plenteous.
The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest
for the earth.
Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof: thou
makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop fatness.
They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and the little hills shall
rejoice on every side.
The folds shall be full of sheep: the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn,
that they shall laugh and sing.
<h3>Psalm 65</h3>
For the end. A song of a plasm of resurrection
O BE joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of his Name, make
his praise to be glorious.
Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the greatness of
thy power shall thine enemies be found liars unto thee.
For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy Name.
O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is in his doing
toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the water on foot;
there did we rejoice thereof.
He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people: and such as will
not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.
O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to slip.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our loins.
Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water, and
thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay thee my vows, which I
promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of rams: I will offer
bullocks and goats.
O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what he hath
done for my soul.
I called unto him with my mouth: and gave him praises with my tongue.
If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart: the Lord will not hear me.
But God hath heard me: and considered the voice of my prayer.
Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned his mercy from me.
<h3>Psalm 66</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns
GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his countenance,
and be merciful unto us:
That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the folk righteously,
and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God, shall
give us his blessing.
God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 67</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song of David
LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee
before him.
Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away: and like as wax
melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the presence of God.
But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them also be merry and
joyful .
O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name: magnify him that rideth upon
the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise him in his Name JAH, and
rejoice before him.
He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows: even God
in his holy habitation.
He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the
prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates continue in scarceness.
O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through
the wilderness;
The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God: even as Sinai
also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.
Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreshedst it
when it was weary.
Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness
prepared for the poor.
The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers.
Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited: and they of the household
divided the spoil.
Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove: that
is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.
When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake: then were they as white as
snow in Salmon.
As the hill of Basan, so is God's hill: even an high hill, as the hill of Basan.
Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which it pleaseth him to
dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: and the Lord
is among them, as in the holy place of Sinai.
Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for
men: yea, even for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among
them.
Praised be the Lord daily: even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his benefits
upon us.
He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is the Lord, by
whom we escape death.
God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalp of such a one as
goeth on still in his wickedness.
The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan: mine own
will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the tongue of
thy dogs may be red through the same.
It is well seen, O God, how thou goest: how thou, my God and King, goest in the
sanctuary.
The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the damsels
playing with the timbrels.
Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations: from the ground
of the heart.
There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their counsel: the
princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.
Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing, O God, that thou
hast wrought in us,
For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem: so shall kings bring presents unto thee.
When the company of the spear-men, and multitude of the mighty are scattered
abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they humbly bring pieces of
silver: and when he hath scattered the people that delight in war;
Then shall the princes come out of Eqypt: the Morians' land shall soon stretch
our her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord;
Who sitteth in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he doth send out his
voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.
Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel: his worship and strength is in the
clouds.
O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: even the God of Israel, he will give
strength and power unto his people; blessed be God.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 68</h3>
For the end. A Psalm of David for alternate verses
SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.
I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is: I am come into deep waters, so
that the floods run over me.
I am weary of crying; my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for waiting so long
upon my God.
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that
are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.
I paid them the things that I never took: God, thou knowest my simpleness, and
my faults are not hid from thee.
Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my cause:
let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of
Israel.
And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof: shame hath covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an alien unto my mother's
children.
For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me: and the rebukes of them that
rebuked thee are fallen upon me.
I wept, and chastened myself with fasting: and that was turned to my reproof.
I put on sackcloth also: and they jested upon me.
They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs upon
me.
But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.
Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the truth of thy salvation.
Take me out of the mire, that I sink not: O let me be delivered from them that
hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up: and let
not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable: turn thee unto me
according to the multitude of thy mercies.
And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: O haste thee, and
hear me.
Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: O deliver me, because of mine enemies.
Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are
all in thy sight.
Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to
have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.
They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and let the things that
should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.
Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not: and ever bow thou down their backs.
Pour out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold
of them.
Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they talk how they may vex
them whom thou hast wounded.
Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and not come into thy
righteousness.
Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be written among the
righteous.
As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God, shall lift me up.
I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with thanksgiving.
This also shall please the Lord: better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God, and your soul
shall live.
For the Lord heareth the poor: and despiseth not his prisoners.
Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea, and all that moveth therein.
For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah: that men may dwell there,
and have it in possession.
The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his Name
shall dwell therein.
<h3>Psalm 69</h3>
For the end. By David for a remembrance; that the Lord may save me
HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned
backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.
Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame: that cry over me, There,
there.
But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let all such as
delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and in misery: haste thee unto me, O God.
Thou art my helper and my redeemer: O Lord, make no long tarrying.

<h3>Psalm 70</h3>
By David. A psalm sung by the sons of Jonadab and the first that were taken captive
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: but rid
me and deliver me in thy righteousness, incline thine ear unto me, and save
me.
Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may alway resort: thou hast promised to
help me, for thou art my house of defence and my castle.
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the hand of the
unrighteous and cruel man.
For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope, even from
my youth.
Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: thou art he that took
me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall be always of thee.
I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is in thee.
O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy glory and honour
all the day long.
Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength faileth
me.
For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul take their
counsel together, saying: God hath forsaken him; persecute him, and take
him, for there is none to deliver him.
Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me.
Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul: let them be covered
with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.
As for me, I will patiently abide alway: and will praise thee more and more.
My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation: for I know no end
thereof.
I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy
righteousness only.
Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I tell of
thy wondrous works.
Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed: until I have
shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that
are yet for to come.
Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are they that thou hast
done; O God, who is like unto thee?
O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me, and yet didst thou
turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth
again.
Thou hast brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every side.
Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an
instrument of musick: unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Holy One
of Israel.
My lips will be fain when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul whom thou hast
delivered.
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are
confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.
<h3>Psalm 71</h3>
For Solomon
GIVE the King thy judgements, O God: and thy righteousness unto the King's
son.
Then shall he judge thy people according unto right: and defend the poor.
The mountains also shall bring peace: and the little hills righteousness unto the
people.
He shall keep the simple folk by their right: defend the children of the poor, and
punish the wrong-doer.
They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth: from one generation
to another.
He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool: even as the drops that
water the earth.
In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea, and abundance of peace, so long as
the moon endureth.
His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other: and from the flood unto
the world's end.
They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him: his enemies shall lick
the dust.
The kings of Tharsis and of the isles shall give presents: the kings of Arabia and
Saba shall bring gifts.
All kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do him service.
For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth: the needy also, and him that hath
no helper.
He shall be favourable to the simple and needy: and shall preserve the souls of
the poor.
He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong: and dear shall their blood
be in his sight.
He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia: prayer shall be
made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.
There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills: his fruit shall
shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city like grass upon the earth.
His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the
posterities: which shall be blessed through him; and all the heathen shall
praise him.
Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel: which only doeth wondrous
things;
And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: and all the earth shall be filled
with his majesty. Amen, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 72</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
TRULY God is loving unto Israel: even unto such as are of a clean heart.
Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone: my treadings had well-nigh slipt.
And why? I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such
prosperity.
For they are in no peril of death: but are lusty and strong.
They come in no misfortune like other folk: neither are they plagued like other
men.
And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride: and overwhelmed with
cruelty.
Their eyes swell with fatness: and they do even what they lust.
They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy: their talking is against the
most High.
For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their tongue goeth
through the world.
Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no small advantage.
Tush, say they, how should God perceive it: is there knowledge in the most High?
Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in
possession: and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed
mine hands in innocency.
All the day long have I been punished: and chastened every morning.
Yea, and I had almost said even as they: but lo, then I should have condemned
the generation of thy children.
Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me,
Until I went into the sanctuary of God: then understood I the end of these men;
Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places: and castest them down, and
destroyest them.
O how suddenly do they consume: perish, and come to a fearful end!
Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh: so shalt thou make their image to
vanish out of the city.
Thus my heart was grieved: and it went even through my reins.
So foolish was I, and ignorant: even as it were a beast before thee.
Nevertheless, I am alway by thee: for thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel: and after that receive me with glory.
Whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth that I desire in
comparison of thee.
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my
portion for ever.
For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that
commit fornication against thee.
But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord God: and
to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
<h3>Psalm 73</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot
against the sheep of thy pasture?
O think upon thy congregation: whom thou hast purchased and redeemed of old.
Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance: and mount Sion, wherein thou hast
dwelt.
Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy: which hath done
evil in thy sanctuary.
Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations: and set up their
banners for tokens.
He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees: was known to bring it to an
excellent work.
But now they break down all the carved work thereof: with axes and hammers.
They have set fire upon thy holy places: and have defiled the dwelling-place of
thy Name, even unto the ground.
Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether: thus have
they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.
We see not our tokens, there is not one prophet more: no, not one is there among
us, that understandeth any more.
O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour: how long shall the enemy
blaspheme thy Name, for ever?
Why withdrawest thou thy hand: why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy
bosom to consume the enemy?
For God is my King of old: the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself.
Thou didst divide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the
dragons in the waters.
Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces: and gavest him to be meat for the
people in the wilderness.
Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks: thou driedst up
mighty waters.
The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked: and how the foolish
people hath blasphemed thy Name.
O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the enemies: and
forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.
Look upon the covenant: for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel
habitations.
O let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the poor and needy give praise
unto thy Name.
Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
blasphemeth thee daily.
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the presumption of them that hate thee
increaseth ever more and more.

<h3>Psalm 74</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: A psalm of a song for Asaph
UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks: yea, unto thee do we give thanks.
Thy Name also is so nigh: and that do thy wondrous works declare.
When I receive the congregation: I shall judge according unto right.
The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the pillars of it.
I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly: and to the ungodly, Set not up your horn.
Set not up your horn on high: and speak not with a stiff neck.
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west: nor yet from the
south.
And why? God is the Judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixed,
and he poureth out of the same.
As for the dregs thereof: all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and suck
them out.
But I will talk of the God of Jacob: and praise him for ever.
All the horns of the ungodly also will I break: and the horns of the righteous shall
be exalted.
<h3>Psalm 75</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns, a psalm for Asaph: A song for the Assyrian
IN JEWRY is God known: his Name is great in Israel.
At Salem is his tabernacle: and his dwelling in Sion.
There brake he the arrows of the bow: the shield, the sword, and the battle.
Thou art of more honour and might: than the hills of the robbers.
The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep: and all the men whose hands
were mighty have found nothing.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob: both the chariot and horse are fallen.
Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when thou art
angry?
Thou didst cause thy judgement to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled,
and was still;
When God arose to judgement: and to help all the meek upon earth.
The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise: and the fierceness of them shalt
thou refrain.
Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that are round about him:
bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
He shall refrain the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among the kings of the
earth.
<h3>Psalm 76</h3>
For the end. For Idithun, a psalm of Asaph
I WILL cry unto God with my voice: even unto God will I cry with my voice, and
he shall hearken unto me.
In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran and ceased not in the
night-season ; my soul refused comfort.
When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God: when my heart is vexed, I will
complain.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble, that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old: and the years that are past.
I call to remembrance my song: and in the night I commune with mine own
heart, and search out my spirits.
Will the Lord absent himself for ever: and will he be no more intreated?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly to an end for
evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his loving-kindness in
displeasure?
And I said, It is mine own infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right
hand of the most Highest.
I will remember the works of the Lord: and call to mind thy wonders of old time.
I will think also of all thy works: and my talking shall be of thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is holy: who is so great a God as our God?
Thou art the God that doeth wonders: and hast declared thy power among the
people.
Thou hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid: the depths
also were troubled.
The clouds poured out water, the air thundered: and thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: the lightnings shone upon the
ground: the earth was moved, and shook withal.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and thy footsteps are
not known.
Thou leddest thy people like sheep: by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<h3>Psalm 77</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
HEAR my law, O my people: incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hard sentences of old;
Which we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told us;
That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to come: but
to shew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he
hath done.
He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law: which he commanded our
forefathers to teach their children;
That their posterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn;
To the intent that when they came up: they might shew their children the same;
That they might put their trust in God: and not to forget the works of God, but to
keep his commandments;
And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation: a
generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not
stedfastly unto God;
Like as the children of Ephraim: who being harnessed, and carrying bows,
turned themselves back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his law;
But forgat what he had done: and the wonderful works that he had shewed for
them.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt:
even in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea, and let them go through: he made the waters to stand on an
heap.
In the day-time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night through with a
light of fire.
He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness: and gave them drink thereof, as it had
been out of the great depth.
He brought waters out of the stony rock: so that it gushed out like the rivers.
Yet for all this they sinned more against him: and provoked the most Highest in
the wilderness.
They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their lust.
They spake against God also, saying: Shall God prepare a table in the
wilderness?
He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
flowed withal: but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?
When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and
there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;
Because they believed not in God: and put not their trust in his help.
So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.
He rained down manna also upon them for to eat: and gave them food from
heaven.
So man did eat angels' food: for he sent them meat enough.
He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven: and through his power he
brought in the south-west-wind.
He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand
of the sea.
He let it fall among their tents: even round about their habitation.
So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire: they were
not disappointed of their lust.
But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon
them, and slew the wealthiest of them: yea, and smote down the chosen
men that were in Israel.
But for all this they sinned yet more: and believed not his wondrous works.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years in trouble.
When he slew them, they sought him: and turned them early, and inquired after
God.
And they remembered that God was their strength: and that the high God was
their redeemer.
Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and dissembled with him
in their tongue.
For their heart was not whole with him: neither continued they stedfast in his
covenant.
But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds: and destroyed them not.
Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not suffer his whole
displeasure to arise.
For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were even a wind that
passeth away, and cometh not again.
Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness: and grieved him in the
desert.
They turned back, and tempted God: and moved the Holy One in Israel.
They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered them from the
hand of the enemy;
How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
He turned their waters into blood: so that they might not drink of the rivers.
He sent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to destroy them.
He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar: and their labour unto the grasshopper.
He destroyed their vines with hail-stones: and their mulberry-trees with the frost.
He smote their cattle also with hail-stones: and their flocks with hot
thunderbolts.
He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure and trouble:
and sent evil angels among them.
He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death: but gave
their life over to the pestilence;
And smote all the first-born in Egypt: the most principal and mightiest in the
dwellings of Ham.
But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep: and carried them in the
wilderness like a flock.
He brought them out safely, that they should not fear: and overwhelmed their
enemies with the sea.
And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary: even to his mountain
which he purchased with his right hand.
He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land to be divided among
them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not his testimonies;
But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers: starting aside like a
broken bow.
For they grieved him with their hill-altars: and provoked him to displeasure with
their images.
When God heard this, he was wroth: and took sore displeasure at Israel.
So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that he had pitched
among men.
He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with his inheritance.
The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not given to
marriage.
Their priests were slain with the sword: and there were no widows to make
lamentation.
So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep: and like a giant refreshed with wine.
He smote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a perpetual shame.
He refused the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
But chose the tribe of Judah: even the hill of Sion which he loved.
And there he built his temple on high: and laid the foundation of it like the
ground which he hath made continually.
He chose David also his servant: and took him away from the sheep-folds.
As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him: that he might
feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
So he fed them with a faithful and true heart: and ruled them prudently with all
his power.

<h3>Psalm 78</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they
defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the
air: and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.
Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem: and there was
no man to bury them.
We are become an open shame to our enemies: a very scorn and derision unto
them that are round about us.
Lord, how long wilt thou be angry: shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?
Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee: and upon
the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.
For they have devoured Jacob: and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon: for we are
come to great misery.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: O deliver us, and be
merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake.
Wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?
O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed: be openly shewed upon
the heathen in our sight.
O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to the
greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die.
And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee: reward
thou them , O Lord, seven-fold into their bosom.
So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for
ever: and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to
generation.
<h3>Psalm 79</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses. A testimony for Asaph: a Psalm concerning the Assyrian
HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep: shew
thyself also, thou that sittest upon the cherubims.
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses: stir up thy strength, and come, and
help us.
Turn us again, O God: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
O Lord God of hosts: how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears: and givest them plenteousness of
tears to drink.
Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh us
to scorn.
Turn us again, thou God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall
be whole.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and
planted it.
Thou madest room for it: and when it had taken root it filled the land.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it: and the boughs thereof were like
the goodly cedar-trees.
She stretched out her branches unto the sea: and her boughs unto the river.
Why hast thou then broken down her hedge: that all they that go by pluck off her
grapes?
The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up: and the wild beasts of the field
devour it.
Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven: behold, and visit this
vine;
And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted: and the branch
that thou madest so strong for thyself.
It is burnt with fire, and cut down: and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy
countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man, whom
thou madest so strong for thine own self.
And so will not we go back from thee: O let us live, and we shall call upon thy
Name.
Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.
<h3>Psalm 80</h3>
For the end. A psalm for Asaph, concerning the winepresses
SING we merrily unto God our strength: make a cheerful noise unto the God of
Jacob.
Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret: the merry harp with the lute.
Blow up the trumpet in the new-moon: even in the time appointed, and upon our
solemn feast-day.
For this was made a statute for Israel: and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony: when he came out of the land of
Egypt, and had heard a strange language.
I eased his shoulder from the burden: and his hands were delivered from making
the pots.
Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee: and heard thee what
time as the storm fell upon thee.
I proved thee also: at the waters of strife.
Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel: if thou wilt hearken unto me,
There shall no strange god be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any other god.
I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy
mouth wide, and I shall fill it.
But my people would not hear my voice: and Israel would not obey me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts: and let them follow their own
imaginations.
O that my people would have hearkened unto me: for if Israel had walked in my
ways,
I should soon have put down their enemies: and turned my hand against their
adversaries.
The haters of the Lord should have been found liars: but their time should have
endured for ever.
He should have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour: and with honey out of
the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

<h3>Psalm 81</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
GOD standeth in the congregation of princes: he is a Judge among gods.
How long will ye give wrong judgement: and accept the persons of the ungodly?
Defend the poor and fatherless: see that such as are in need and necessity have
right.
Deliver the outcast and poor: save them from the hand of the ungodly.
They will not be learned nor understand, but walk on still in darkness: all the
foundations of the earth are out of course.
I have said, Ye are gods: and ye are all the children of the most Highest.
But ye shall die like men: and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth: for thou shalt take all heathen to thine
inheritance.
<h3>Psalm 82</h3>
A song of a psalm for Asaph
HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: refrain not thyself, O God.
For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring: and they that hate thee have lift up
their head.
They have imagined craftily against thy people: and taken counsel against thy
secret ones.
They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people:
and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
For they have cast their heads together with one consent: and are confederate
against thee;
The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismaelites: the Moabites and
Hagarenes;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek: the Philistines, with them that dwell at Tyre.
Assur also is joined with them: and have holpen the children of Lot.
But do thou to them as unto the Madianites: unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the
brook of Kison;
Who perished at Endor: and became as the dung of the earth.
Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeb: yea, make all their princes like
as Zeba and Salmana;
Who say, Let us take to ourselves: the houses of God in possession.
O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and as the stubble before the wind;
Like as the fire that burneth up the wood: and as the flame that consumeth the
mountains.
Persecute them even so with thy tempest: and make them afraid with thy storm.
Make their faces ashamed, O Lord: that they may seek thy Name.
Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more: let them be put to
shame, and perish.
And they shall know that thou, whose Name is Jehovah: art only the most Highest
over all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 83</h3>
For the end. A song for the sons of Core, concerning the winepresses
O HOW amiable are thy dwellings: thou Lord of hosts!
My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the Lord: my heart
and my flesh rejoice in the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest where she may
lay her young: even thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be alway praising thee.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are thy ways.
Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well: and the pools are filled
with water.
They will go from strength to strength: and unto the God of gods appeareth every
one of them in Sion.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer :hearken, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our defender: and look upon the face of thine Anointed.
For one day in thy courts: is better than a thousand.
I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God: than to dwell in the tents
of ungodliness.
For the Lord God is a light and defence: the Lord will give grace and worship,
and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a godly life.
O Lord God of hosts: blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 84</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou hast turned away the
captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people: and covered all their sins.
Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure: and turned thyself from thy wrathful
indignation.
Turn us then, O God our Saviour: and let thine anger cease from us.
Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever: and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from
one generation to another?
Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Shew us thy mercy, O Lord: and grant us thy salvation.
I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak
peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again.
For his salvation is nigh them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each
other.
Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness hath looked down from
heaven.
Yea, the Lord shall shew loving-kindness: and our land shall give her increase.
Righteousness shall go before him: and he shall direct his going in the way.

Wash away the multitude of my sins with the magnitude of thy mercy, O good one, and save me, thy servant, who flee unto thee and with faith entreat thy mercy. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> An Angel made the furnace bedew the holy Children. * But the command of God consumed the Chaldeans * and prevailed upon the tyrant to cry: * O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou. When Thou wast buffeted, Thou didst smite the venomous malice of the serpent; and when Thou wast suspended upon the Tree, O only Mighty One, Thou didst enlighten all to cry: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! Having tasted of the Tree, Adam, the first man, found death; but when Christ, the new Adam, died on the Tree, He granted us immortal life, slaying the greatly crafty servant. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Enduring suffering, O martyrs, ye were borne up to the Lord by your torment, and ye stood on the firm rock of faith, casting down all the wicked malice of the enemy at the command of God. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Illumined by your sufferings, O spiritual athletes, ye shine forth more brightly than the sun; having destroyed all the powers of darkness, and chanting to Christ: Blessed is the God of our fathers! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “When Thou wast suspended upon the Cross, Thou didst alter all creation, O Thou who art immutable in Thy divinity,” said the Virgin to her Son.

Cease not to entreat our God the Lover of mankind, O all-immaculate one, that we may receive the ultimate forgiveness of evils, and may obtain the good things prepared in the heavens for those who love Him. We bless thee, O most immaculate one, who hast given birth to the blessed Lord, Who with divine blessings crowneth human nature, and maketh new what before had grown old. Enriched at the havens of thy salvation, O pure one, we are saved from the storm; and holding our faith in thee to be the strength of our soul, we cry: Blessed art thou who hast given birth to God in the flesh! </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Thou didst make flame bedew the holy children, * and didst burn the sacrifice of a righteous man with water. * For Thou alone, O Christ, dost do all as Thou willest, * Thee do we supremely exalt throughout all ages. Lifted up upon the Tree in humility of heart, O God Most High, Thou didst humble the most prideful serpent, and raised up Adam, who had been brought low by the passions, O Compassionate One. Given gall to eat when Thou wast lifted up upon the Tree, Thou didst transform the ancient bitterness, O compassionate Master, sweetness of all, Who art hypostatic Life. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye did not bend your knee before graven images, O all-praised ones, but were sacrificed like unblemished lambs; and ye brought low the might of the evil one, hymning Christ throughout the ages. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye were shown to be temples of the living Spirit, O martyrs, and ye cast down the temples of the idols and were caught up to the heavenly temple, hymning Christ throughout the ages. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Jacob beheld thee beforehand, O Virgin, as the ladder leading up to the heights of heaven us who have plunged headlong into the abyss of evils; wherefore, we bless thee, the pure one, throughout the ages. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. We confess thee to be the true Theotokos, and with the angel with faith we cry out to thee “Rejoice!”; for on behalf of those on earth thou alone hast given birth to Joy, O joyous, pure and blessed one.

O divinely joyous Maiden who knewest not wedlock, haven and hope of Christians amid the storm, deliver thy servants from perils, sufferings and afflictions, and from everlasting fire. When Thou shalt come in glory to judge all mankind, O Master, number me, a sinner, with the lambs on Thy right side, through the supplications of Thy Mother, that I may glorify Thee throughout all ages.

O Lord of times and seasons, at noon Thou wast uplifted, crucified, upon the Tree in the midst of the earth, O only Long-suffering One, setting aright him who in the midst of paradise suffered the fall through the corrupting fruit. The Cross was lifted up, and the tyrant was dealt a mortal wound to his soul; those bound were released from corruption, and understanding was planted in all mankind; the enemy stood by, paralyzed, and all were filled with joy. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The earth was conjoined with the heavens, for Christ was sacrificed on the Cross, O martyrs of the Lord; and He drew unto Him the multitude of you who endured a multitude of extreme torments, and caused you to shine forth with the multitude of His divine ministers. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Shining with immaterial light, ye became gods by adoption, O martyrs of the Lord, making your abode in the mansions of the firstborn, full of eternal glory; wherefore, we, the faithful, honor you as is meet. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “An awesome birthgiving did I endure, O long-suffering Master, when I gave birth to Thee in a strange manner.

O all-immaculate Theotokos, thou art the hope, protection and joy of the faithful; wherefore, I beseech thy compassions: Enlighten my soul, which the gloom of many sins and evil thoughts have darkened. O holy and divinely joyous Virgin: Open unto me the gates of light, lest the night of sin cover me; and guide my life to the calm harbor of the divine precepts of Him Who became man through thee.

<h3>Psalm 85</h3>
A prayer of David
BOW down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor, and in misery.
Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: my God, save thy servant that putteth his
trust in thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I will call daily upon thee.
Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, art good and gracious: and of great mercy unto all them that call
upon thee.
Give ear, Lord, unto my prayer: and ponder the voice of my humble desires.
In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou hearest me.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord: there is not one that can do
as thou doest.
All nations whom thou hadst made shall come and worship thee, O Lord: and
shall glorify thy Name.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in thy truth: O knit my heart unto
thee, that I may fear thy Name.
I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and will praise thy Name for
evermore.
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the
nethermost hell.
O God, the proud are risen against me: and the congregations of naughty men
have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.
But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, plenteous
in goodness and truth.
O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength unto thy
servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.
Shew some token upon me for good, that they who hate me may see it and be
ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
<h3>Psalm 86</h3>
A psalm of a song for the sons of Core
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loveth the gates of Sion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Very excellent things are spoken of thee: thou city of God.
I will think upon Rahab and Babylon: with them that know me.
Behold ye the Philistines also: and they of Tyre, with the Morians; lo, there was
he born.
And of Sion it shall be reported that he was born in her: and the most High shall
stablish her.
The Lord shall rehearse it when he writeth up the people: that he was born
there.
The singers also and trumpeters shall he rehearse: All my fresh springs shall be
in thee.
<h3>Psalm 87</h3>
A song of a psalm for the sons of Core. For the end. Upon Maeleth, for responsive strains.
Concerning instruction for Æman the Israelite
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: O let my
prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling.
For my soul is full of trouble: and my life draweth nigh unto hell.
I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit: and I have been even as a
man that hath no strength.
Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded, and lie in the grave: who
are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit: in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
Thine indignation lieth hard upon me: and thou hast vexed me with all thy
storms.
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me: and made me to be
abhorred of them.
I am so fast in prison: that I cannot get forth.
My sight faileth for very trouble: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have
stretched forth my hands unto thee.
Dost thou shew wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise up again, and
praise thee?
Shall thy loving-kindness be shewed in the grave: or thy faithfulness in
destruction?
Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy righteousness in the
land where all things are forgotten?
Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come before thee.
Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face from me?
I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die: even from my youth
up thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me: and the fear of thee hath undone me.
They came round about me daily like water: and compassed me together on
every side.
My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me: and hid mine acquaintance
out of my sight.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 88</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Ætham the Israelite
MY SONG shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the Lord: with my mouth will I
ever be shewing thy truth from one generation to another.
For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever: thy truth shalt thou stablish in the
heavens.
I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn unto David my servant;
Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne from one generation to
another.
O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and thy truth in the
congregation of the saints.
For who is he among the clouds: that shall be compared unto the Lord?
And what is he among the gods: that shall be like unto the Lord?
God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints: and to be had in
reverence of all them that are round about him.
O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee: thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on
every side.
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.
Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it: thou hast scattered thine enemies
abroad with thy mighty arm.
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast laid the foundation of
the round world, and all that therein is.
Thou hast made the north and the south: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy
Name.
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat: mercy and truth shall go
before thy face.
Blessed is the people, O Lord, that can rejoice in thee: they shall walk in the light
of thy countenance.
Their delight shall be daily in thy Name: and in thy righteousness shall they
make their boast.
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy loving-kindness thou shalt lift
up our horns.
For the Lord is our defence: the Holy One of Israel is our King.
Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help
upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
I have found David my servant: with my holy oil have I anointed him.
My hand shall hold him fast: and my arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not be able to do him violence: the son of wickedness shall not
hurt him.
I will smite down his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.
My truth also and my mercy shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be
exalted.
I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand in the floods.
He shall call me, Thou art my Father: my God, and my strong salvation.
And I will make him my first-born: higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast with
him.
His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the days of
heaven.
But if his children forsake my law: and walk not in my judgements;
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I will visit their
offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.
Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my
truth to fail.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: I
have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David.
His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the sun before me.
He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the faithful witness in
heaven.
But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed: and art displeased at him.
Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his crown to the ground.
Thou hast overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong holds.
All they that go by spoil him: and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all his adversaries to
rejoice.
Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword: and givest him not victory in the
battle.
Thou hast put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: and covered him with dishonour.
Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever: and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
O remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men for
nought?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death: and shall he deliver his soul
from the hand of hell?
Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses: which thou swarest unto David in thy
truth?
Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I do bear in my
bosom the rebukes of many people.
Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of
thine Anointed: Praised be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 89</h3>
A prayer of Moses the man of God
LORD, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of
men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a
watch in the night.
As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut down,
dried up and withered.
For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance.
For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our years to an end, as
it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong
that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but labour and
sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.
But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man feareth,
so is thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be glad all the
days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us: and for the years
wherein we have suffered adversity.
Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou the work
of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handywork.
<h3>Psalm 90</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the most High: shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty..
I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my strong hold: my God, in him
will I trust.
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome
pestilence.
He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers:
his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by
day;
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness that destroyeth
in the noon-day.
A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall
not come nigh thee.
Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold: and see the reward of the ungodly.
For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of defence very high.
There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou
tread under thy feet.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him
up, because he hath known my Name.
He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble; I will
deliver him, and bring him to honour.
With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation.

<h3>Psalm 91</h3>
A psalm of a song for the Sabbath-day
IT IS a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy
Name, O most Highest.
To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning: and of thy truth in the nightseason.
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute: upon a loud instrument,
and upon the harp.
For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works: and I will rejoice in giving
praise for the operations of thy hands.
O Lord, how glorious are thy works: thy thoughts are very deep.
An unwise man doth not well consider this: and a fool doth not understand it.
When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish: then shall they be destroyed for ever; but thou,
Lord, art the most Highest for evermore.
For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, lo, thine enemies shall perish: and all the workers
of wickedness shall be destroyed.
But mine horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn: for I am anointed with
fresh oil.
Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies: and mine ear shall hear his
desire of the wicked that arise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar
in Libanus.
Such as are planted in the house of the Lord: shall flourish in the courts of the
house of our God.
They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age: and shall be fat and wellliking.
That they may shew how true the Lord my strength is: and that there is no
unrighteousness in him.
<h3>Psalm 92</h3>
For the day before the Sabbath. When the land was first inhabited, the praise of a song by David
THE Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his
apparel, and girded himself with strength.
He hath made the round world so sure: that it cannot be moved.
Ever since the world began hath thy seat been prepared: thou art from
everlasting.
The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lift up their voice: the floods lift up
their waves.
The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly: but yet the Lord, who
dwelleth on high, is mightier.
Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becometh thine house for ever.
<h3>Psalm 93</h3>
A psalm of David for the fourth day of the week
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth: thou God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself.
Arise, thou Judge of the world: and reward the proud after their deserving.
Lord, how long shall the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly triumph?
How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully: and make such proud
boasting?
They smite down thy people, O Lord: and trouble thine heritage.
They murder the widow and the stranger: and put the fatherless to death.
And yet they say, Tush, the Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob
regard it.
Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the eye, shall he not
see?
Or he that nurtureth the heathen: it is he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not
he punish?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man: that they are but vain.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him in thy law.
That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity: until the pit be digged
up for the ungodly.
For the Lord will not fail his people: neither will he forsake his inheritance;
Until righteousness turn again unto judgement: all such as are true in heart shall
follow it.
Who will rise up with me against the wicked: or who will take my part against
the evil-doers?
If the Lord had not helped me: it had not failed but my soul had been put to
silence.
But when I said, My foot hath slipt: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.
In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart: thy comforts have
refreshed my soul.
Wilt thou have any thing to do with the stool of wickedness: which imagineth
mischief as a law?
They gather them together against the soul of the righteous: and condemn the
innocent blood.
But the Lord is my refuge: and my God is the strength of my confidence.
He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own
malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

<h3>Psalm 94</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
O COME, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our
salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: and shew ourselves glad in
him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God: and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hills is his
also.
The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep
of his hand.
To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the provocation,
and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: It is a people that
do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways;
Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.
<h3>Psalm 95</h3>
When the house was built after the captivity. A song by David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the whole earth.
Sing unto the Lord, and praise his Name: be telling of his salvation from day to
day.
Declare his honour unto the heathen: and his wonders unto all people.
For the Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised: he is more to be feared
than all gods.
As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols: but it is the Lord that made
the heavens.
Glory and worship are before him: power and honour are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people: ascribe unto the Lord
worship and power.
Ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his Name: bring presents, and come
into his courts.
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let the whole earth stand in awe of
him.
Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King: and that it is he who hath
made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; and how that he
shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea make a noise, and
all that therein is.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood
rejoice before the Lord.
For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: and with righteousness to judge
the world, and the people with his truth.
<h3>Psalm 96</h3>
For David, when his land is established
THE Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
may be glad thereof.
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgement are the
habitation of his seat.
There shall go a fire before him: and burn up his enemies on every side.
His lightnings gave shine unto the world: the earth saw it, and was afraid.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord
of the whole earth.
The heavens have declared his righteousness: and all the people have seen his
glory.
Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in vain
gods: worship him, all ye gods.
Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad, because of
thy judgements, O Lord.
For thou, Lord, art higher than all that are in the earth: thou art exalted far
above all gods.
O ye that love the Lord, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: the Lord
preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of
the ungodly.
There is sprung up a light for the righteous: and the joyful gladness for such as
are true-hearted.
Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous: and give thanks for a remembrance of his
holiness.

<h3>Psalm 97</h3>
A Psalm of David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous things.
With his own right hand, and with his holy arm: hath he gotten himself the
victory.
The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the
sight of the heathen.
He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel: and all the
ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.
Shew yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing, rejoice, and give thanks.
Praise the Lord upon the harp: sing to the harp with a psalm of thanksgiving.
With trumpets also and shawms: O shew yourselves joyful before the Lord the
King.
Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round world, and they that
dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together before the
Lord: for he is come to judge the earth.
With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with equity.
<h3>Psalm 98</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord is King, be the people never so unpatient: he sitteth between the
cherubims, be the earth never so unquiet.
The Lord is great in Sion: and high above all people.
They shall give thanks unto thy Name: which is great, wonderful, and holy.
The King's power loveth judgement; thou hast prepared equity: thou hast
executed judgement and righteousness in Jacob.
O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before his footstool, for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call upon his
Name: these called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar: for they kept his testimonies, and
the law that he gave them.
Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou forgavest them, O God, and
punishedst their own inventions.
O magnify the Lord our God, and worship him upon his holy hill: for the Lord our
God is holy.
<h3>Psalm 99</h3>
A psalm for thanksgiving
O BE joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come
before his presence with a song.
Be ye sure that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we
ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:
be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.
For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting: and his truth endureth from
generation to generation.
<h3>Psalm 100</h3>
A Psalm of David
MY SONG shall be of mercy and judgement: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.
O let me have understanding: in the way of godliness.
When wilt thou come unto me: I will walk in my house with a perfect heart.
I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of unfaithfulness: there shall
no such cleave unto me.
A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour: him will I destroy.
Whoso hath also a proud look and high stomach: I will not suffer him.
Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land: that they may dwell with
me.
Whoso leadeth a godly life: he shall be my servant.
There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house: he that telleth lies shall not
tarry in my sight.
I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land: that I may root out all
wicked doers from the city of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 101</h3>
A prayer for the poor, when he is deeply afflicted and pours out his supplication before the Lord
HEAR my prayer, O Lord: and let my crying come unto thee.
Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine ear unto me
when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.
For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt up as it
were a firebrand.
My heart is smitten down, and withered liked grass: so that I forget to eat my
bread.
For the voice of my groaning: my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.
I am become like a pelican in the wilderness: and like an owl that is in the desert.
I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that sitteth alone upon the
house-top.
Mine enemies revile me all the day long: and they that are mad upon me are
sworn together against me.
For I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping.
And that because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and
cast me down.
My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.
But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever: and thy remembrance throughout all
generations.
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that thou have mercy
upon her, yea, the time is come.
And why? thy servants think upon her stones: and it pitieth them to see her in
the dust.
The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy
majesty;
When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall appear;
When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute: and despiseth not
their desire.
This shall be written for those that come after: and the people which shall be
born shall praise the Lord.
For he hath looked down from his sanctuary: out of the heaven did the Lord
behold the earth;
That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity: and deliver the
children appointed unto death;
That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion: and his worship at
Jerusalem;
When the people are gathered together: and the kingdoms also, to serve the
Lord.
He brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.
But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age: as for thy
years, they endure throughout all generations.
Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax old as doth a
garment;
And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art
the same, and thy years shall not fail.
The children of thy servants shall continue: and their seed shall stand fast in thy
sight.
<h3>Psalm 102</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me praise his holy Name.
Praise the Lord, O my soul: and forget not all his benefits;
Who forgiveth all thy sin: and healeth all thine infirmities;
Who saveth thy life from destruction: and crowneth thee with mercy and lovingkindness;
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: making thee young and lusty as an
eagle.
The Lord executeth righteousness and judgement: for all them that are
oppressed with wrong.
He shewed his ways unto Moses: his works unto the children of Israel.
The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and of great goodness.
He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth he his anger for ever.
He hath not dealt with us after our sins: nor rewarded us according to our
wickednesses.
For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth: so great is his mercy
also toward them that fear him.
Look how wide also the east is from the west: so far hath he set our sins from us.
Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children: even so is the Lord merciful unto
them that fear him.
For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that we are but dust.
The days of man are but as grass: for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.
For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone: and the place thereof shall know
it no more.
But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon them that
fear him: and his righteousness upon children's children;
Even upon such as keep his covenant: and think upon his commandments to do
them.
The Lord hath prepared his seat in heaven: and his kingdom ruleth over all.
O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength: ye that fulfil his
commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words.
O praise the Lord, all ye his hosts: ye servants of his that do his pleasure.
O speak good of the Lord, all ye works of his, in all places of his dominion: praise
thou the Lord, O my soul.

<h3>Psalm 103</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art become exceeding
glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.
Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment: and spreadest out the
heavens like a curtain.
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: and maketh the clouds his
chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.
He maketh his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire.
He laid the foundations of the earth: that it never should move at any time.
Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment: the waters stand in the
hills.
At thy rebuke they flee: at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.
They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath: even unto the
place which thou hast appointed for them.
Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass: neither turn again to
cover the earth.
He sendeth the springs into the rivers: which run among the hills.
All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild asses quench their thirst.
Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation: and sing among the
branches.
He watereth the hills from above: the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
He bringeth forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the service of men;
That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of
man: and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen
man's heart.
The trees of the Lord also are full of sap: even the cedars of Libanus which he
hath planted;
Wherein the birds make their nests: and the fir-trees are a dwelling for the stork.
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats: and so are the stony rocks for the
conies.
He appointed the moon for certain seasons: and the sun knoweth his going down.
Thou makest darkness that it may be night: wherein all the beasts of the forest
do move.
The lions roaring after their prey: do seek their meat from God.
The sun ariseth, and they get them away together: and lay them down in their
dens.
Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour: until the evening.
O Lord, how manifold are thy works: in wisdom hast thou made them all; the
earth is full of thy riches.
So is the great and wide sea also: wherein are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great beasts.
There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan: whom thou hast made to take his
pastime therein.
These wait all upon thee: that thou mayest give them meat in due season.
When thou givest it them they gather it: and when thou openest thy hand they
are filled with good.
When thou hidest thy face they are troubled: when thou takest away their breath
they die, and are turned again to their dust.
When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made: and thou shalt renew
the face of the earth.
The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in
his works.
The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch the hills, they shall
smoke.
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will praise my God while I have my
being.
And so shall my words please him: my joy shall be in the Lord.
As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall
come to an end: praise thou the Lord, O my soul, praise the Lord.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 104</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his Name: tell the people what
things he hath done.
O let your songs be of him, and praise him: and let your talking be of all his
wondrous works.
Rejoice in his holy Name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek the Lord and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Remember the marvellous works that he hath done: his wonders, and the
judgements of his mouth.
O ye seed of Abraham his servant: ye children of Jacob his chosen.
He is the Lord our God: his judgements are in all the world.
He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise: that he made to a
thousand generations;
Even the covenant that he made with Abraham: and the oath that he sware unto
Isaac;
And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law: and to Israel for an everlasting
testament;
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan: the lot of your inheritance;
When there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in the land;
What time as they went from one nation to another: from one kingdom to another
people;
He suffered no man to do them wrong: but reproved even kings for their sakes;
Touch not mine Anointed: and do my prophets no harm.
Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land: and destroyed all the provision of
bread.
But he had sent a man before them: even Joseph, who was sold to be a bondservant;
Whose feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his soul;
Until the time came that his cause was known: the word of the Lord tried him.
The king sent, and delivered him: the prince of the people let him go free.
He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his substance;
That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach his senators wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people exceedingly: and made them stronger than their
enemies.
Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people: and dealt untruly with his
servants.
Then sent he Moses his servant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.
And these shewed his tokens among them: and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and it was dark: and they were not obedient unto his word.
He turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs: yea, even in their kings' chambers.
He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies: and lice in all their
quarters.
He gave them hail-stones for rain: and flames of fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and fig-trees: and destroyed the trees that were in
their coasts.
He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable:
and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their
ground.
He smote all the first-born in their land: even the chief of all their strength.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person
among their tribes.
Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were afraid of them.
He spread out a cloud to be a covering: and fire to give light in the night-season.
At their desire he brought quails: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in the
dry places.
For why? he remembered his holy promise: and Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy: and his chosen with gladness.
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people
in possession;
That they might keep his statutes: and observe his laws.

<h3>Psalm 105</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for
ever.
Who can express the noble acts of the Lord: or shew forth all his praise?
Blessed are they that alway keep judgement: and do righteousness.
Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation;
That I may see the felicity of thy chosen: and rejoice in the gladness of thy
people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers: we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly.
Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great
goodness in remembrance: but were disobedient at the sea, even at the
Red sea.
Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake: that he might make his power
to be known.
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the
deep, as through a wilderness.
And he saved them from the adversaries' hand: and delivered them from the
hand of the enemy.
As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them: there was not
one of them left.
Then believed they his words: and sang praise unto him.
But within a while they forgat his works: and would not abide his counsel.
But lust came upon them in the wilderness: and they tempted God in the desert.
And he gave them their desire: and sent leanness withal into their soul.
They angered Moses also in the tents: and Aaron the saint of the Lord.
So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of
Abiram.
And the fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the ungodly.
They made a calf in Horeb: and worshipped the molten image.
Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.
And they forgat God their Saviour: who had done so great things in Egypt;
Wondrous works in the land of Ham: and fearful things by the Red sea.
So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood
before him in the gap: to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should
destroy them.
Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no credence unto his
word;
But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord.
Then lift he up his hand against them: to overthrow them in the wilderness;
To cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves unto Baal-peor: and ate the offerings of the dead.
Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions: and the plague was
great among them.
Then stood up Phinees and prayed: and so the plague ceased.
And that was counted unto him for righteousness: among all posterities for
evermore.
They angered him also at the waters of strife: so that he punished Moses for
their sakes;
Because they provoked his spirit: so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Neither destroyed they the heathen: as the Lord commanded them;
But were mingled among the heathen: and learned their works.
Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay: yea,
they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters:
whom they had offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled
with blood.
Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring with their own
inventions.
Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people: insomuch that
he abhorred his own inheritance.
And he gave them over into the hands of the heathen: and they that hated them
were lords over them.
Their enemies oppressed them: and had them in subjection.
Many a time did he deliver them: but they rebelled against him with their own
inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.
Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity: he heard their complaint.
He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude of
his mercies: yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity
them.
Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen: that we may
give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world without end: and
let all the people say, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 106</h3>
Alleluia
Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed: and delivered from the
hand of the enemy;
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west: from the
north and from the south.
They went astray in the wilderness out of the way: and found no city to dwell in;
Hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.
So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: and he delivered them from their
distress.
He led them forth by the right way: that they might go to the city where they
dwelt.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he satisfieth the empty soul: and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: being fast bound in misery
and iron ;
Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly regarded the
counsel of the most Highest;
He also brought down their heart through heaviness: they fell down, and there
was none to help them.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death: and brake
their bonds in sunder.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he hath broken the gates of brass: and smitten the bars of iron in sunder.
Foolish men are plagued for their offence: and because of their wickedness.
Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they were even hard at death's door.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
He sent his word, and healed them: and they were saved from their destruction.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving: and tell out his
works with gladness!
They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their business in great waters;
These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.
For at his word the stormy wind ariseth: which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep: their soul
melteth away because of the trouble.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are at their wits' end.
So when thy cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivereth them out of their
distress.
For he maketh the storm to cease: so that the waves thereof are still.
Then are they glad, because they are at rest: and so he bringeth them unto the
haven where they would be.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people: and praise him
in the seat of the elders!
Who turneth the floods into a wilderness: and drieth up the water-springs.
A fruitful land maketh he barren: for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water: and water-springs of a dry
ground.
And there he setteth the hungry: that they may build them a city to dwell in.
That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards: to yield them fruits of
increase.
He blesseth them so that they multiply exceedingly: and suffereth not their cattle
to decrease.
And again, when they are minished and brought low: through oppression,
through any plague or trouble;
Though he suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants: and let them wander
out of the way in the wilderness.
Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery: and maketh him households like a flock of
sheep.
The righteous will consider this, and rejoice: and the mouth of all wickedness
shall be stopped.
Whoso is wise will ponder these things: and they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 107</h3>
Song of a psalm by David
O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing and give praise with the
best member that I have.
Awake, thou lute, and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing praises unto
thee among the nations.
For thy mercy is greater than the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
That thy beloved may be delivered: let thy right hand save them, and hear thou
me.
God hath spoken in his holiness: I will rejoice therefore, and divide Sichem, and
mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head.
Judah is my law-giver, Moab is my wash-pot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe,
upon Philistia will I triumph.
Who will lead me into the strong city: and who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou forsaken us, O God: and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our
hosts?
O help us against the enemy: for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do great acts: and it is he that shall tread down our
enemies.
<h3>Psalm 108</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise: for the mouth of the ungodly, yea, the
mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.
And they have spoken against me with false tongues: they compassed me about
also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part: but I give
myself unto prayer.
Thus have they rewarded me evil for good: and hatred for my good will.
Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand.
When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned: and let his prayer be
turned into sin.
Let his days be few: and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless: and his wife a widow.
Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread: let them seek it also out of
desolate places.
Let the extortioner consume all that he hath: and let the stranger spoil his
labour.
Let there be no man to pity him: nor to have compassion upon his fatherless
children.
Let his posterity be destroyed: and in the next generation let his name be clean
put out.
Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight of the Lord:
and let not the sin of his mother be done away.
Let them alway be before the Lord: that he may root out the memorial of them
from off the earth.
And that, because his mind was not to do good: but persecuted the poor helpless
man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.
His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him: he loved not blessing,
therefore shall it be far from him.
He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a raiment: and it shall come into his
bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be unto him as the cloke that he hath upon him: and as the girdle that he is
alway girded withal.
Let it thus happen from the Lord unto mine enemies: and to those that speak evil
against my soul.
But deal thou with me, O Lord God, according unto thy Name: for sweet is thy
mercy.
O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor: and my heart is wounded within me.
I go hence like the shadow that departeth: and am driven away as the
grasshopper.
My knees are weak through fasting: my flesh is dried up for want of fatness.
I became also a reproach unto them: they that looked upon me shaked their
heads.
Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy.
And they shall know, how that this is thy hand: and that thou, Lord, hast done it.
Though they curse, yet bless thou: and let them be confounded that rise up
against me; but let thy servant rejoice.
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame: and let them cover themselves with
their own confusion, as with a cloke.
As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth: and praise him
among the multitude.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor: to save his soul from the
unrighteous judges.

        </p><h3>THE READING FROM THE BOOK OF GENESIS (28, 10-17).  </h3><p>Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a  certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the  stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.  And he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached  to heaven; and, behold, the Angels of God ascending and descending on it. And,  behold, the Lord stood above it, and said: I am the Lord God of Abraham thy Father  and the God of Isaac; be not afraid: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it,  and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread  abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south; and in thee  and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am with  thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into  this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee  of. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said: Surely the Lord is in this place,  and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said: How dreadful is this place! this is none  other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.  </p><h3>THE READING FROM THE PROPHECY OF EZEKIEL (43, 27. AND 44, 1-4). </h3><p>Thus saith the Lord: upon the eighth day and so forward, the priests shall make  your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings, and I will accept you,  saith the Lord God. Then He brought me back the way of the gate of the outward  sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut. Then said the Lord unto  me: This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it;  because the Lord, the God of Israel hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut. As  for the Prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord; he shall enter by the way  of the pourch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same. Then brought He  me the way of the north gate before the house, and I looked, and, behold, the glory of  the Lord filled the house of the Lord.  </p><h3>THE READING FROM THE PROVERBS (9, 1-11).  </h3><p>Wisdom hath builded her house, and hath fixed the seven pillars thereof. She hath  killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. She  hath sent forth her maidens. She crieth upon the highest places of the city: whoso is  single, let him turn in hither; as for them that want understanding, she saith unto  them: come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine which I have mingled. Forsake  foolishness, and ye shall live, and go in search of understanding that ye may live, and  improve understanding in knowledge. He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself  shame; and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot, for rebukes unto  the wicked are as wounds to him. Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee; rebuke a  wise man, and he will love thee. Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet  wiser; teach a just man, and he will increase in learning. The fear of the Lord is the  beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. For  understanding of the law proceedeth from a good thought, for in this wise thy days  shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.

          <div><h3>Ode III</h3><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> There is none as holy as Thou, * O Lord my God, * who hast exalted the horn of The faithful O good One, * and strengthened us upon the rock * of Thy confession. </p><p>There is none that hath sinned as I have, becoming a slave to the evils of unbridled thoughts, O most holy and pure one; but, placing my hope in thee, I pray: Rescue me from them.! </p><p>Behold, all the evils of the enemy that have rained upon me like wounds, weigh me down; rendering me fetid and causing my soul to fall. </p><p>Glory ..., Many are my transgressions; wherefore, falling down before thee with faith, O most holy one, I, the lowly one, cry aloud: At the dread hour entreat Him to Whom thou hast given flesh. </p><p>Now & ever ..., O holy Theotokos, as thou hast maternal boldness before God, rescue me who am deserving of all condemnation, and make me to dwell in His dwelling-place. </p></div>
        
          <div><h3>Ode IV</h3><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Christ is my power, * my God and my Lord, * the holy Church divinely singeth, * crying with a pure mind, * keeping festival in the Lord. </p><p>Grant me a wellspring of tears, O Lady, that I may wash away the defilement of my lowly soul and regain the beauty which I have lost through the lying counsel of the serpent. </p><p>O my compassionate God, O God Who lovest mankind and willest mercy, pour forth Thy mercy now upon me; for Thy Mother, my hope and ally, entreateth Thee. </p><p>Glory ..., Taking pity, O most immaculate one, save me, the terrible prodigal one, who have mindlessly and shamelessly sinned against thee; and free me from Gehenna. </p><p>Now & ever ..., Having given birth to the Life of all, thou hast destroyed the field of death; wherefore, I cry out to thee: I have sinned!

But do thou beseech Him to save me, O good one, for to thee have I fled. Clothe me in my former vesture. </p><p>Now & ever ..., Jesus, Who is fire, did not consume thy womb when He issued forth from thee in the flesh, pray thou to Him, O pure one, that He deliver from fire and all manner of torment those who hymn thee with faith. </p><p>Lord, have mercy, <i class="note">Thrice</i>.  </p><p>Glory ..., Now & ever ..., <i class="note">Sessional hymn, in Tone VI:</i> </p><p>O pure and glorious Virgin, thou glory of the angels, who alone art blessed: </p><p>when thou didst stand at the foot of the Cross of thy Son and God, unable to endure the malice of the enemy thou didst cry aloud, lamenting with sighs: How can He Who is the Lover of mankind endure the abuse of these men? </div>
        
          <div><h3>Ode VII</h3><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> In Babylon the Children feared not the fiery furnace; * but cast into the midst of the flames * they were bedewed and sang: * ‘O Lord God of our fathers, Blessed art Thou.’ </p><p>O my soul, awake from all the evils thou hast committed! Why sleepest thou still? Wherefore liest thou in the slumber of despondency? Cry aloud to the Theotokos: O all-holy one, help me! </p><p>I venerate the image of thy countenance, yet I dare not lift mine eyes unto thee, O most holy one. I pray that I may receive the forgiveness of my debts, and that in purity I may behold thy most pure icon. </p><p>Glory ..., To thine aid, O Birthgiver of God, do I flee and fall prostrate, begging to receive forgiveness. Disdain me not, O Lady, but taking pity, save me. </p><p>Now & ever ..., I have defiled my soul and mind with the many and various evils of the corrupter of souls, O most pure one, and I beseech thee: Disdain not thy servant, but rescue me from his temptations. </p></div>
        
          <div><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Suffering affliction for the sake of the laws of their fathers, * the blessed Children in Babylon * scorned the foolish decree of the King. * Standing together in the midst of the flames, they remained unharmed, * and sang a song fitting for almighty God: * ‘O ye works of the Lord, praise ye the Lord * and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages.’ </p><p>Having sinned beyond measure and defiled my body with sins, fool that I am, I consider the day of inexorable judgment, and at a loss and afraid, I am filled with fear and trembling, and fall down before thy compassion, O Lady. Spurn me not, but behold my sorrow, and deliver me from all condemnation and the many and varied torments. </p><p>Having spurned the divine law, wretch that I am, I lie wholly in slothfulness. </p><p>But, looking upon me, arise quickly, O most pure one, and cause me to receive the portion of the saved; that, rejoicing, I may cry unto thee: Rejoice, O joy of the world, only intercessor for those who with faith invoke thy steadfast protection. </p><p>Glory ..., Woe is me, O my soul! How can I stand, in fear and trembling, before the dread tribunal, where even the angels shall be afraid and quake? But, as thou hast the Theotokos as a good ally, bend thy knees and lift up thy hands, crying: Direct thy merciful gaze upon me and have pity in that hour, O Virgin! </p><p>Now & ever ..., Show forth now the sure might of thine aid, for like one in thy debt, thy Son is moved by thy maternal pleas, O Virgin. Wherefore, come now in mine hour of need, that I not depart unprepared, but may live on, O all-hymned and pure Theotokos. </p></div>
        
          <div><h3>Ode IX</h3><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Weep not for Me, O Mother, * beholding in the tomb the Son Whom thou hast conceived * without seed in the womb; * for I shall arise and shall be glorified, * and as God I shall exalt with glory unceasing, * those that with faith and love magnify thee. </p><p>That I may receive the glory of heaven, I pray to thee, O Virgin: Absolve me, and deliver me from the debts of darkness, overlooking all that I have committed in knowledge or in ignorance, day or night, O most pure one; that, rejoicing, I may offer thee a hymn of thanksgiving. </p><p>Rescue me from all manner of tribulations, O Maiden, and set my feet upon the rock of divine salvation; for, having acquired thee now as an invincible intercessor, I trust that I may pass freely through the wall of separation erected by disobedience when the fruit of the tree was eaten. </p><p>Glory ..., I beseech thee, who hast given birth to the merciful Judge and Master: accept the boldness of my defiled lips and my wretched hymnody, and abhor me not, though I have sinned more than all others; for I, thy servant, have thee as my helper after God. </p><p>Now & ever ..., In that thou art more exalted than all creatures, thou didst conceive in thy womb the incarnate God, O Theotokos. Him do thou earnestly entreat, O pure one, that He release thy servant from all care, that I may freely glorify thee with praise. </p></div>

<h3>Psalm 134</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, laud ye the Name of the Lord: praise it, O ye servants of the
Lord;
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord: in the courts of the house of our God.
O praise the Lord, for the Lord is gracious: O sing praises unto his Name, for it is
lovely.
For why? the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself: and Israel for his own
possession.
For I know that the Lord is great: and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth: and in the sea,
and in all deep places.
He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world: and sendeth forth
lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his treasures.
He smote the first-born of Egypt: both of man and beast.
He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of Egypt:
upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.
He smote divers nations: and slew mighty kings;
Sehon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Basan: and all the kingdoms of
Canaan;
And gave their land to be an heritage: even an heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever: so doth thy memorial, O Lord, from one
generation to another.
For the Lord will avenge his people: and be gracious unto his servants.
As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold: the work of men's
hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, but they see not.
They have ears, and yet they hear not: neither is there any breath in their
mouths.
They that make them are like unto them: and so are all they that put their trust
in them.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Israel: praise the Lord, ye house of Aaron.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, praise the Lord.
Praised be the Lord out of Sion: who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
<h3>Psalm 135</h3>
Alleluia
O give thanks unto the God of all gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O thank the Lord of all lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who only doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who by his excellent wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who laid out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who hath made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The sun to rule the day: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The moon and the stars to govern the night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote Egypt with their first-born: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever;
With a mighty hand, and stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who divided the Red sea in two parts: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And made Israel to go through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever.
But as for Pharaoh and his host, he overthrew them in the Red sea: for his mercy
endureth for ever.
Who led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Yea, and slew mighty kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Sehon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And Og the king of Basan: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And gave away their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Even for an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who remembered us when we were in trouble: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And hath delivered us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 136</h3>
For David. A psalm of Jeremias
BY THE waters of Babylon we sat down and wept: when we remembered thee, O
Sion.
As for our harps, we hanged them up: upon the trees that are therein.
For they that led us away captive required of us then a song, and melody in our
heaviness: Sing us one of the songs of Sion.
How shall we sing the Lord's song: in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem: let my right hand forget her cunning.
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: yea, if I
prefer not Jerusalem in my mirth.
Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem: how they said,
Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.
O daughter of Babylon , wasted with misery: yea, happy shall he be that
rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us.
Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children: and throweth them against the
stones.

<h3>Psalm 137</h3>
A psalm of David, of Aggæus and Zacharias
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: even before the gods
will I sing praise unto thee.
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of thy
loving-kindness and truth: for thou hast magnified thy Name and thy word
above all things.
When I called upon thee, thou heardest me: and enduedst my soul with much
strength.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they have heard the words
of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: that great is the glory of the Lord.
For though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: as for the
proud, he beholdeth them afar off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me: thou shalt
stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy right
hand shall save me.
The lord shall make good his loving-kindness toward me: yea, thy mercy, O Lord,
endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine own hands.
<h3>Psalm 138</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
O LORD, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou knowest my downsitting and mine up-rising, thou understandest my thoughts long before.
Thou art about my path, and about my bed: and spiest out all my ways.
For lo, there is not a word in my tongue: but thou, O Lord, knowest it altogether.
Thou hast fashioned me behind and before: and laid thine hand upon me.
Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me: I cannot attain unto it.
Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit: or whither shall I go then from thy
presence?
If I climb up into heaven, thou art there: if I go down to hell, thou art there also.
If I take the wings of the morning: and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me.
If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall my night be turned
to day.
Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day:
the darkness and light to thee are both alike.
For my reins are thine: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous
are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.
My bones are not hid from thee: though I be made secretly, and fashioned
beneath in the earth.
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect: and in thy book were all
my members written;
Which day by day were fashioned: when as yet there was none of them.
How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God: O how great is the sum of them!
If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: when I wake up I am
present with thee.
Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God: depart from me, ye blood-thirsty men.
For they speak unrighteously against thee: and thine enemies take thy Name in
vain.
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee: and am not I grieved with those that
rise up against thee?
Yea, I hate them right sore: even as though they were mine enemies.
Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart: prove me, and examine my
thoughts.
Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me: and lead me in the way
everlasting.
<h3>Psalm 139</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
DELIVER me, O Lord, from the evil man: and preserve me from the wicked man.
Who imagine mischief in their hearts: and stir up strife all the day long.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: adders' poison is under their
lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly: preserve me from the wicked
men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.
The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with cords: yea, and
set traps in my way.
I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my prayers, O Lord.
O Lord God, thou strength of my health: thou hast covered my head in the day of
the battle.
Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord: let not his mischievous imagination
prosper, lest they be too proud.
Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them: that compass me
about.
Let hot burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire and into the
pit, that they never rise up again.
A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: evil shall hunt the wicked
person to overthrow him.
Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor: and maintain the cause of the
helpless.
The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name: and the just shall continue in
thy sight.

<h3>Psalm 140</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, I call upon thee, haste thee unto me: and consider my voice when I cry
unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense: and let the lifting up of my
hands be an evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and keep the door of my lips.
O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing: let me not be occupied in
ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, lest I eat of such things
as please them.
Let the righteous rather smite me friendly: and reprove me.
But let not their precious balms break my head: yea, I will pray yet against their
wickedness.
Let their judges be overthrown in stony places: that they may hear my words, for
they are sweet.
Our bones lie scattered before the pit: like as when one breaketh and heweth
wood upon the earth.
But mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust , O cast not out my
soul.
Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me: and from the traps of the
wicked doers.
Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together: and let me ever escape them.
<h3>Psalm 141</h3>
A psalm of instruction for David. When he was in the cave; a prayer
I CRIED unto the Lord with my voice: yea, even unto the Lord did I make my
supplication.
I poured out my complaints before him: and shewed him of my trouble.
When my spirit was in heaviness thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I
walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
I looked also upon my right hand: and saw there was no man that would know
me.
I had no place to flee unto: and no man cared for my soul.
I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said: Thou art my hope, and my portion in the land
of the living.
Consider my complaint: for I am brought very low.
O deliver me from my persecutors: for they are too strong for me.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name: which thing if
thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto my company.
<h3>Psalm 142</h3>
A psalm of David when his son pursued him
HEAR my prayer, O Lord, and consider my desire: hearken unto me for thy truth
and righteousness' sake.
And enter not into judgement with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
living be justified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the
ground: he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have been long
dead.
Therefore is my spirit vexed within me: and my heart within me is desolate.
Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works: yea, I exercise
myself in the works of thy hands.
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.
Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint: hide not thy face from
me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for in thee is my trust:
shew thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I flee unto thee to hide me.
Teach me to do a thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God: let thy loving
Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.
Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name's sake: and for thy righteousness' sake bring
my soul out of trouble.
And of thy goodness slay mine enemies: and destroy all them that vex my soul ;
for I am thy servant.

<h3>Psalm 143</h3>
A psalm of David concerning Goliath
BLESSED be the Lord my strength: who teacheth my hands to war, and my
fingers to fight.
My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in whom I trust:
who subdueth my people that is under me.
Lord, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him: or the son of man, that
thou so regardest him?
Man is like a thing of nought: his time passeth away like a shadow.
Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall
smoke.
Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them: shoot out thine arrows, and consume
them.
Send down thine hand from above: deliver me, and take me out of the great
waters, from the hand of strange children.
Whose mouth talketh of vanity: and their right hand is a right hand of
wickedness.
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: and sing praises unto thee upon a tenstringed lute.
Thou hast given victory unto kings: and hast delivered David thy servant from
the peril of the sword.
Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children: whose mouth talketh
of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.
That our sons may grow up as the young plants: and that our daughters may be
as the polished corners of the temple.
That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of store: that our
sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets.
That our oxen may be strong to labour, that there be no decay: no leading into
captivity, and no complaining in our streets.
Happy are the people that are in such a case: yea, blessed are the people who
have the Lord for their God.
<h3>Psalm 144</h3>
David's Psalm of praise
I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King: and I will praise thy Name for ever and
ever.
Every day will I give thanks unto thee: and praise thy Name for ever and ever.
Great is the Lord, and marvellous worthy to be praised: there is no end of his
greatness.
One generation shall praise thy works unto another: and declare thy power.
As for me, I will be talking of thy worship: thy glory, thy praise, and wondrous
works;
So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts: and I will also tell of
thy greatness.
The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be shewed: and men shall sing of
thy righteousness.
The Lord is gracious and merciful: long-suffering and of great goodness.
The Lord is loving unto every man: and his mercy is over all his works.
All thy works praise thee, O Lord: and thy saints give thanks unto thee.
They shew the glory of thy kingdom: and talk of thy power;
That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom: might be known unto
men.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom: and thy dominion endureth throughout
all ages.
The Lord upholdeth all such as fall: and lifteth up all those that are down.
The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord: and thou givest them their meat in due
season.
Thou openest thine hand: and fillest all things living with plenteousness.
The Lord is righteous in all his ways: and holy in all his works.
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: yea, all such as call upon him
faithfully.
He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will
help them.
The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but scattereth abroad all the
ungodly.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh give thanks unto his
holy Name for ever and ever.

<h3>Psalm 145</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul; while I live will I praise the Lord: yea, as long as I
have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.
O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man: for there is no help in
them.
For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn again to his earth: and then
all his thoughts perish.
Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help: and whose hope is in the
Lord his God;
Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: who keepeth his
promise for ever;
Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong: who feedeth the hungry.
The Lord looseth men out of prison: the Lord giveth sight to the blind.
The Lord helpeth them that are fallen: the Lord careth for the righteous.
The Lord careth for the strangers, he defendeth the fatherless and widow :as for
the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.
The Lord thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore: and throughout all
generations.
<h3>Psalm 146</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God: yea, a
joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: and gather together the out-casts of Israel.
He healeth those that are broken in heart: and giveth medicine to heal their
sickness.
He telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and great is his power: yea, and his wisdom is infinite.
The Lord setteth up the meek: and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground.
O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving: sing praises upon the harp unto our God;
Who covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth: and
maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men;
Who giveth fodder unto the cattle: and feedeth the young ravens that call upon
him.
He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse: neither delighteth he in any
man's legs.
But the Lord's delight is in them that fear him: and put their trust in his mercy.
<h3>Psalm 147</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.
For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates: and hath blessed thy children within
thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: and his word runneth very
swiftly.
He giveth snow like wool: and scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who is able to abide his frost?
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he bloweth with his wind, and the
waters flow.
He sheweth his word unto Jacob: his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with any nation: neither have the heathen knowledge of his
laws.

<h3>Psalm 148</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord of heaven: praise him in the height.
Praise him, all ye angels of his: praise him, all his host.
Praise him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars and light.
Praise him, all ye heavens: and ye waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the Name of the Lord: for he spake the word, and they were
made; he commanded, and they were created.
He hath made them fast for ever and ever: he hath given them a law which shall
not be broken.
Praise the Lord upon earth: ye dragons, and all deeps;
Fire and hail, snow and vapours: wind and storm, fulfilling his word;
Mountains and all hills: fruitful trees and all cedars;
Beasts and all cattle: worms and feathered fowls;
Kings of the earth and all people: princes and all judges of the world;
Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of the Lord: for
his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven and earth.
He shalt exalt the horn of his people; all his saints shall praise him: even the
children of Israel, even the people the serveth him.
<h3>Psalm 149</h3>
Alleluia
O SING unto the Lord a new song: let the congregation of saints praise him.
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: and let the children of Sion be joyful in
their King.
Let them praise his Name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with
tabret and harp.
For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: and helpeth the meek-hearted.
Let the saints be joyful with glory: let them rejoice in their beds.
Let the praises of God be in their mouth: and a two-edged sword in their hands;
To be avenged of the heathen: and to rebuke the people;
To bind their kings in chains: and their nobles with links of iron.
That they may be avenged of them, as it is written: Such honour have all his
saints.
<h3>Psalm 150</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE God in his holiness: praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him in his noble acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.
Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: praise him upon the lute and harp.
Praise him in the cymbals and dances: praise him upon the strings and pipe.
Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: praise him upon the loud cymbals.
Let every thing that hath breath: praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 151</h3>
This psalm is ascribed to David and is outside the number. When he slew Goliath in single
combat.
LITTLE was I among my brethren: a younger brother in my father’s house.
My hands, they made an instrument of music: my fingers, they prepared a
psaltery.
And who shall bring back tidings to my master? The Lord himself, himself gives
ear.
Himself sent forth his messenger: and took me from among my father’s sheep;
and with the oil of his anointing He anointed me.
Comely my brethren were and tall: and yet they found not favor with the Lord.
But I, I sallied forth to meet the alien: and he reviled me by all his idols.
But I drew forth the sword that was beside him: I cut his head off with it, and
from the sons of Israel removed reproach.</div>

        <h3>  THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE (1, 39-48; 1, 56)  </h3><p>At that time: Mary arose and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of  Juda; And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. And it came to  pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb;  and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: And she spake out with a loud voice,  and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And  whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For, lo, as  soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my  womb for joy. And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of  those things which were told her from the Lord. And Mary said, My soul doth  magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For he hath  regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all  generations shall call me blessed. And Mary abode with her about three months, and  returned to her own house.  </p>

O most glorious One, thou hast truly carried in thy holy arms the Lord Who assumed flesh from thee, and having ascended above into the heavens thou hast left mankind the celebration of the joyous day of thine honored <i class="name">Annunciation</i>, wherefore we glorify thee, chanting: Chant unto the Lord and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages.  Rejoice, O ye divine Prophets, venerating the honored <i class="name">Annunciation</i> of the Virgin Theotokos, for she hath fulfilled your prophecies, bringing forth Christ the King of all, Whom we exalt throughout all ages.  Thou art the uplifting of the fallen, the gladness of the despondent, the instructress of the wandering, the visitation and cure of the sick and unto all Christians salvation. O Lady, preserve us who entreat thee and venerate thy divine <i class="name">Annunciation</i>, and deliver us from all attacks of the alien enemies.  </p><p><i class="note">Katavasia:</i> The Offspring of the Theotokos * saved the holy children in the furnace. * He who was then prefigured hath now been born on earth, * and He gathereth all creation to hymn thee: * all ye works praise ye the Lord * and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages. </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Heaven was stricken with awe, * and the ends of the earth were filled with amazement, * for God hath appeared in the flesh, * and thy womb was rendered more spacious than the heavens. * Wherefore, the ranks of men and of angels * magnify thee as the Theotokos.  O city of God, glorious praises have been rendered unto thee, for He Who eternally reigneth over heaven and earth hath been born from thee raising thee from earth to heaven. Never cease to entreat Him on behalf of those who venerate thine honored <i class="name">Annunciation</i>, by which we magnify thee.  The incorporeal orders, the assembly of the patriarchs and Apostles, the choir of the prophets, the army of the martyrs, the companies of hierarchs and venerable fathers, and all ye saints rejoice with us celebrating the divine <i class="name">Annunciation</i>, magnifying the Theotokos.  O most pure Virgin, thou hast sanctified everything by thy childbearing and been revealed to be the cause of the splendid and all honorable day of thy divine <i class="name">Annunciation</i>, which celebrating, we magnify thee.  O most pure Birthgiver of God; exalt the horn of right believing Orthodox Christians and subdue the raging of our adversaries.

        </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the precious & life-creating Cross, in Tone VI: </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> He Who in ancient times * hid the pursuing tyrant beneath the waves of the sea, * is hidden beneath the earth by the children of those whom once He saved. * But let us, like the children, sing unto the Lord, * for gloriously hath He been glorified. By Thine honored Passion Thou didst honor the dishonored nature of mankind; wherefore, honoring Thee with fear, we magnify and glorify Thy might with faith; for gloriously hast Thou been glorified. By Thy blood, O Word, Thou didst stanch the unrighteous outpouring of blood and thereby cleanse human nature of its evil defilement, O Almighty; wherefore, saved, we glorify Thy might. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The right laudable opposition of the martyrs truly vanquished the bestial shedder of blood; it tamed the nature of fire with the dew of divine grace, and stilling the terrible storm of polytheism. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having dried up the downpours of delusion with the showers of your blood, ye pour forth showers of healings upon the world, repelling the flame of ungodly passions. Wherefore, ye are blessed, O martyrs. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> When the Maiden who knew not wedlock, the adornment of the faithful, beheld Thee, Who art comely in beauty, bereft of comeliness and form when suffering, she exclaimed maternally and glorified Thee with love. </p><p><i class="note">Another canon, of the most holy Theotokos, the acrostic whereof is the Greek alphabet, in the same tone: </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i></i> Same as the foregoing. O most pure Virgin, gracious and glorious Mary, Mediatress of joy, impart grace with divine grace unto those who hymn thee, that we may send up to thee hymnody of thanksgiving. O the wonder of thy mysteries, O Mother of God! For thou hast been revealed to be the Sovereign Lady of creation, bearing in thine arms Him upon Whom the armies of heaven dare not gaze. Wherefore, we call thee blessed. The whole race of mankind hath been condemned to mortal corruption through our first mother’s tasting of the tree; but it hath been restored by thee, O pure one, in that thou hast given birth to Life incorruptible. </p><h3>Ode III</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> When creation beheld Thee, * Who founded the whole earth upon the waters, * covered in the flesh by the waters, * it was seized with awe, and cried aloud: * None is holy save Thee, O Lord!  Beholding Thee, Who suspended the whole earth unsupported upon the waters, lifted up upon the Tree, Thy side pierced, O Lord, the sun grew dark, understanding Thee to be the enlightenment of all. The evil-doer who of old wounded Adam in paradise is wounded by Thy nails, O Long-suffering One; and having been wounded, he remaineth forever incurable; but we, the faithful, have found Thee to be the healing of all wounds. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> When the angelic choir beheld the flock of the martyrs scattered for the Lamb Who was slain, they marveled at how, being material, they vanquished the immaterial foe, receiving crowns of victory. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Invested with the power of Him Who alone is the mightiest of all in strength, the saints wrestled with the enemy and trampled his feeble power underfoot, receiving crowns from God. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> When thou didst behold Him to Whom thou hast given birth wounded by the spear, thou wast wounded in thy heart, O most pure and all-immaculate one; and, marveling, thou didst say: “How hath the exceedingly iniquitous assembly repaid Thee, O my Child?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. The enemy of old beguiled me through deception, with the desire for godhood, so that I must needs depart from Eden, O Mother of God; the serpent brought me down to the earth; but Christ took pity on me and, receiving flesh from thy womb, refashioned it. To the Prophet Ezekiel of old, O Maiden, thou didst appear as the portal of life through which the Lord incarnate alone passed; and He kept thee closed, O pure one, in that He is the Most High. The condemnation of the ancient curse hath been lifted by thy mediation, O Mother of God; for, having appeared to thee, O most pure one, the Lord hath poured forth all blessings in abundance upon all, in that He is supremely good. </p><h3>Ode IV</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Foreseeing Thy divine self-emptying upon the Cross, * Habakkuk, in amazement, cried out: * "Thou hast cut asunder the strength of the mighty, * O Good One, * and preached to those in Hades, * as the Almighty One. Desiring to save our first parents, Thou wast slain dead upon the Tree, O Lord, pushing away the unrestrained outstretching of their hands toward the fruit of the tree; and from Thy side Thou hast poured forth remission of sins upon those bound. Thou didst endure suffering, O Supremely good One, that Thou mightest loose us from the irrationality of the passions; Thou didst eat gall, O Master, pouring forth divine sweetness upon me; and Thou wast slain, granting me life. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Bearing the fire of divine love in a rational soul, the passion-bearers of Christ quenched the flame of the most iniquitous ones, showing themselves to be radiant beacons. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having separated themselves from carnal friendship, the divine friends of the King of all hastened mightily to every torment, and prevailing, they were crowned with glory. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “I gave birth to Thee without suffering. How it is that I now see Thee partaking of suffering? How dost Thou endure this?”, the Virgin cried. “O my Son, Who art without beginning, I glorify Thy long-suffering!” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. O thou who, alone from all generations, wast chosen and most pure, O honored and undefiled one who art resplendent in the virtues: With thy radiance enlighten those who hymn thee. Of thy pure blood, O pure Virgin Mother, thou hast given birth unto God, the Savior Who delivereth from evils all who hymn thee, O Maiden full of divine grace. The nature of the immaterial beings doth minister in sanctity to thy divine Offspring, O pure one, and the assemblies of mankind hymns thee with love. Do thou illumine us with thine effulgence. </p><h3>Ode V</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> I seek Thee early in the morning, * Who for our sake didst mercifully empty Thyself * and willingly submit to be baptized by the hand of a servant, * O Word of God, * Grant Thy peace unto me the fallen one, * O Lover of mankind. Thou wast seen to be dead at the place of the skull, slaying Hades by the suffering of Thy flesh; and hanging there, bereft of form or comeliness, O Christ, Thou didst desire to make me beautiful, in that Thou lovest mankind. Desiring to nail the passionate disposition of the first Adam, Thou wast transfixed with nails; and pierced by a spear, and turned away the fiery sword, that it might not deny entry to Thy servants. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Following the sufferings of the Master, the choirs of the martyrs were nailed to trees and their hands were severed; but by their feet they were divinely directed to the way of honorable martyrdom. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Humbling yourselves with perfect mind and humility of heart, in emulation of Him Who hath exalted all, ye utterly cast down the mind of the prideful one who audaciously exalted himself, O martyrs of Christ. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thou didst spring forth from the root of Jesse, O Virgin, and receiving the Planter of the world in the flesh, thou didst bud forth like a flower Him Who by the divine planting of the Cross dried up the offshoots of ungodliness. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. The ladder extending up to the highest, which appeared figuratively unto Jacob, revealed the truly extraordinary nature of thy birthgiving, O Bride of God; for through thee God in His divine condescension truly came to dwell with us, granting us life. Delivered by thee from the grief of our first mother, we have been filled with comfort, O Birthgiver of God, for thou hast given birth to the Gladness of all, the universal Joy; wherefore, O all-hymned one, By thy prayers preserve from tribulations those who hymn thee. Of old Moses beheld the bush unconsumed by fire, and was thereby mystically taught thine image by divine vision, O all-immaculate Virgin; for the Creator, making His abode within thee, did not consume thee, the highest of all created beings, O Bride of God. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Jonah was caught but not held * in the belly of the whale; * for, bearing the image of Thee, * Who hast suffered and wast given to burial, * he came forth from the sea-monster as from a bridal chamber, * and he called out to the watch: * "O ye who keep guard falsely and in vain, * ye have forsaken your own mercy." Of old, when he crossed His arms in blessing his grandsons, Jacob prefigured the Cross; wherefore, O Most High Who didst mount upon the Cross, Thou savest humanity from the ancient curse, and now pourest forth blessing upon those who bless Thee, O only blessed and supremely good Creator. Prefiguring Thy suffering, O Word, of old the great Moses uplifted a brazen serpent upon a tree, delivering those who looked upon it from the venomous sting of the serpent; for when Thou wast crucified, O Master, all of us, the faithful, were delivered from the serpent’s harm. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Of old, the godly and honorable spiritual athletes suffered as though it were others suffering, looking forward to everlasting rewards and joy. By their prayers, O compassionate Christ, deliver from temptations, sins and evil circumstances those who hymn Thee. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The honorable and divine passion-bearers caused the torrents of delusion to cease by the streams of their blood, and were truly shown to be wellsprings pouring forth the water of the knowledge of God upon the faithful. By their prayers, O Savior of the world, rain down remission, life, the cleansing of sins, and great mercy upon all. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The Ewe-lamb, seeing the Chief Shepherd and Master lifted up upon the Tree, cried aloud, weeping maternally: “What is this new mystery, O my Child? How hast Thou, Who art immortal in essence, received death, desiring to deliver mankind from corruption?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. The images of the law and the predictions of the prophets clearly revealed thee, O Theotokos, who wast to bear the Redeemer of the world, the Benefactor of all creation, Who in many and divers ways worketh good for those who glorify thee with faith and love, O pure Lady. O only Birthgiver of God, those who by the deception of the murderous enemy were of old separated from the first-given divine food of paradise, thou didst lead again into paradise when thou hast given birth to the Lord and Savior, Who endured crucifixion and burial in His divine power. He Who by His divine will and creative power brought all things out of non-existence, O pure one, passed through thy womb, both God and man; and with divine radiance, O pure Lady, He illumined those who were before in the darkness of ignorance. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O ineffable wonder! * He, Who in the furnace delivered the holy children from the flame, * is laid in the grave devoid of breath, * for the salvation of us who chant: * O God our Redeemer, blessed art Thou!  When the council of the Jews condemned Thee to the Cross, the earth, beholding this, was stricken with fear and the sun hid its rays; but those in darkness beheld the light, chanting: O God our Redeemer, blessed art Thou! O Savior, of Thine own will Thou didst endure mockery, being beaten with a reed and crowned as a king with thorns, O Christ God, for the salvation of us who chant: O God our Redeemer, blessed art Thou! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye were bound, O most lauded martyrs, manifestly loosing all the bonds of the devil’s delusion; and ye endured torments and an unjust death, desiring the life of heaven, and crying aloud: O God our Redeemer, blessed art Thou! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye stood in the midst of the flame, O all-praised martyrs, manifestly burning up delusion; and unconsumed by the dew of divine grace, ye cry out, chanting; O God our Redeemer, blessed art Thou! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Seeing Thee Who desired to be crucified, O Son without beginning, the Theotokos cried out: “I am now overwhelmed by grief of soul, for dying, Thou givest life to those who chant: O God our Redeemer, blessed art Thou!” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. Thy Son and Lord desired Thee, O Mother of God, who art all-adorned as with magnificent golden ornaments, for the salvation of us who cry out to thee: Blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, O pure one! Having found thee like a rose among thorns, O most pure one, with the fragrant beauties of spiritual graces the Master hath filled us, who cry out to Him in compunction: O God our Redeemer, blessed art Thou! The divine prophets, perceiving all the signs of thy divine birthgiving, O pure one, gloriously cried aloud: God shall come forth from a virgin to save those who cry out: O God our Redeemer, blessed art Thou! </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Be thou astonished and afraid, O heaven, * and let the foundations of the earth be shaken; * for lo, He Who dwelleth on high is numbered with the dead * and lodgeth as a stranger in a narrow tomb. * Him do ye children bless, * ye priests praise, and ye people supremely exalt throughout all ages. Drinking the cup of Thy suffering on the Cross, which Thou didst desire, O Christ, Thou hast poured forth upon me springs of remission from Thy life-bearing side, for the sake of the rib of Adam who had died. And I hymn Thee, O Christ, chanting: Ye priests bless; ye people supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! When the iniquitous men condemned Thee to be crucified between two malefactors, O Lord Jesus, Bestower of life, the earth quaked, and all chanted with fear: Ye children bless; ye priests hymn; ye people supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Your death was precious in the sight of God, O spiritual athletes; for having partaken of many sufferings, ye were shown to share in the honored sufferings of Christ, crying out in oneness of mind: Ye children bless; ye priests hymn; ye people supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O martyrs, the weapons ye used against the hordes of the enemy were truly not fleshly, but were the hope, faith and truth which ye received from God; and ye have joined the choirs of the angels, crying out to the Master: Ye priests bless; ye people supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “O Most High, beginningless Son, Thou didst endure to be spat upon, derided and crucified, and mockingly beaten with a reed,” the Birthgiver of God cried aloud; “I glorify the long-suffering of Thee Whom the children bless, the priests hymn, and the people supremely exalt throughout all ages!” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. Thou hast now been foreseen by the divine Daniel as the unquarried mountain, O Maiden, for from thee alone Christ the Rock was cut, without the hand of man, O Virgin. Bless Him ye children; praise Him O priests; supremely exalt Him ye people, throughout all ages! With hymns the heavenly warriors ever glorify thy birthgiving, O pure, Ever-virgin Maiden, and with us they joyously hymn thee as the Mother of God, whom the children bless, the priests praise, and the people supremely exalt throughout all ages. With the rays of thy light, O pure Theotokos Mary, make radiant those who now acknowledge thee to be the true Theotokos; for thou, O Virgin, wast revealed to be the habitation of Light for those who cry out with faith: Rejoice, O blessed and exceedingly glorious one, throughout all ages! We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the </p><p><i class="note">refrain:</i> “More honorable than the cherubim ...”<i class="note"> Prostrations.</i> </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Weep not for Me, O Mother, * beholding in the tomb the Son Whom thou hast conceived * without seed in the womb; * for I shall arise and shall be glorified, * and as God I shall exalt with glory unceasing, * those that with faith and love magnify thee. That Thou mightest deliver from corruption him who became corrupt by eating of the sweet fruit of the tree, O only Savior, Thou wast crucified in the flesh and deigned to die, in that Thou art good. O Jesus, we unceasingly hymn Thy great tender compassion and power. O how didst Thou endure pain, stretched out upon the Cross, releasing me from cruel pangs, O Savior? How didst Thou, Who wast crowned with thorns, burn up all the thorns of my passions? How hast Thou, Who drank vinegar, mixed for us the cup of gladness? </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Cast and held fast in prisons, your members cruelly severed, grievously stretched on the wheel, and thrown to the wild beasts as food, O all ye spiritual athletes, ye did not deny Christ, the Master of all. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The all-radiant and right renowned memory of the spiritual athletes shineth forth more brightly than the rays of the sun: ever enlightening the souls of the pious, driving away the darkness of passions and temptations, and dispelling the most profound gloom of the demons. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thou hast borne Him Who beareth all things, and held in thine hands, as a babe, Him Who hath delivered us from, the hand of the adverse foe, O most pure Lady; and thou didst behold Him Who hath delivered us from the yoke of evil, lifted up upon the tree of the Cross. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. Unto us thou hast supra-naturally appeared as the Mediatress of everlasting joy and life, O pure Birthgiver of God, for thou hast given birth to the Savior of all, Who clearly wipeth ever tear from every mortal face, granting joy to all. Chanting, David, thine ancestor, foretold thee in signs as the ark, and Moses as the golden jar of the divine Manna, O Theotokos; for thou alone didst contain Him Who is ever in the bosom of the Father. Wherefore, we glorify thee with hymns. Thou wast truly more highly exalted than all creation, for thou hast given birth unto God in the flesh; wherefore, O Lady, we, who hope to receive salvation through thee, have thee as an intercessor, a sure hope and a firm bulwark.

        <h3>THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE HEBREWS (9: 1-7)</h3><p>Brethren: verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a 
worldly sanctuary. For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the 
candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. And after 
the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; Which had the golden 
censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the 
golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the 
covenant; And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we 
cannot now speak particularly. Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests 
went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. But into the 
second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he 
offered for himself, and for the errors of the people: 
</p><p><i class="note">Alleluia, in Tone VIII:</i> Hearken, O daughter, and see and incline thine ear. 
</p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> The rich among the people shall entreat thy countenance. 
 
<h3>THE HOLY GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE (10:38-42, 11:27-28)</h3><p>Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a 
certain woman named Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister 
called Mary, which also sat at Jesus” feet, and heard his word. But Martha was 
cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care 
that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. And 
Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled 
about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, 
which shall not be taken away from her. And it came to pass, as he spake these things, 
a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the 
womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked. But he said, Yea rather, 
blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.

<h3>Psalm 119</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN I was in trouble I called upon the Lord: and he heard me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitful tongue.
What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue: even mighty
and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.
Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech: and to have my
habitation among the tents of Kedar.
My soul hath long dwelt among them: that are enemies unto peace.
I labour for peace, but when I speak unto them thereof: they make them ready to
battle.
<h3>Psalm 120</h3>
A song of ascents
I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel: shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defence upon thy right hand.
So that the sun shall not burn thee by day: neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even he that shall keep thy
soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from this time forth for
evermore.
<h3>Psalm 121</h3>
A song of ascents
I WAS glad when they said unto me: We will go into the house of the Lord.
Our feet shall stand in thy gates: O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city: that is at unity in itself.
For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord: to testify unto Israel, to
give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.
For there is the seat of judgement: even the seat of the house of David.
O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
Peace be within thy walls: and plenteousness within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions' sakes: I will wish thee prosperity.
Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God: I will seek to do thee good.
<h3>Psalm 122</h3>
A song of ascents
UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as
the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even so our eyes wait
upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are utterly despised.
Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy: and with the
despitefulness of the proud.
<h3>Psalm 123</h3>
A song of ascents
IF THE Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say: if the Lord
himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;
They had swallowed us up quick: when thy were so wrathfully displeased at us.
Yea, the waters had drowned us: and the stream had gone over our soul.
The deep waters of the proud: had gone even over our soul.
But praised be the Lord: who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.
Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler: the snare is
broken, and we are delivered .
Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.

<h3>Psalm 124</h3>
A song of ascents
THEY that put their trust in the Lord shall be even as the mount Sion: which may
not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.
The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about his
people, from this time forth for evermore.
For the rod of the ungodly cometh not into the lot of the righteous: lest the
righteous put their hand unto wickedness.
Do well, O Lord: unto those that are good and true of heart.
As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness: the Lord shall lead them
forth with the evil-doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 125</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion: then were we like unto them
that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue with joy.
Then said they among the heathen: The Lord hath done great things for them.
Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already: whereof we rejoice.
Turn our captivity, O Lord: as the rivers in the south.
They that sow in tears: shall reap in joy.
He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed: shall
doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.
<h3>Psalm 126</h3>
A song of ascents
EXCEPT the Lord build the house: their labour is but lost that build it.
Except the Lord keep the city: the watchman waketh but in vain.
It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat
the bread of carefulness: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Lo, children and the fruit of the womb: are an heritage and gift that cometh of
the Lord.
Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant: even so are the young children.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed
when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
<h3>Psalm 127</h3>
A song of ascents
BLESSED are all they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: O well is thee, and happy shalt
thou be.
Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of thine house.
Thy children like the olive-branches: round about thy table.
Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the Lord.
The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shalt see Jerusalem in
prosperity all thy life long.
Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children: and peace upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 128</h3>
A song of ascents
MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up: may Israel now
say.
Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up: but they have not
prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed upon my back: and made long furrows.
But the righteous Lord: hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.
Let them be confounded and turned backward: as many as have evil will at Sion.
Let them be even as the grass growing upon the house-tops: which withereth
afore it be plucked up;
Whereof the mower filleth not his hand: neither he that bindeth up the sheaves
his bosom.
So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord prosper you: we wish you
good luck in the Name of the Lord.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 129</h3>
A song of ascents
OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.
O let thine ears consider well: the voice of my complaint.
If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss: O Lord, who may
abide it?
For there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared.
I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him: in his word is my trust.
My soul fleeth unto the Lord: before the morning watch, I say, before the
morning watch.
O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with him is
plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel: from all his sins.
<h3>Psalm 130</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, I am not high-minded: I have no proud looks.
I do not exercise myself in great matters: which are too high for me.
But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his
mother: yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.
O Israel, trust in the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 131</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, remember David: and all his trouble;
How he sware unto the Lord: and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God of Jacob;
I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house: nor climb up into my bed;
I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eye-lids to slumber: neither the
temples of my head to take any rest;
Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord: an habitation for the mighty
God of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of the same at Ephrata: and found it in the wood.
We will go into his tabernacle: and fall low on our knees before his footstool.
Arise, O Lord, into thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness: and let thy saints sing with
joyfulness.
For thy servant David's sake: turn not away the presence of thine Anointed.
The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David: and he shall not shrink from it;
Of the fruit of thy body: shall I set upon thy seat.
If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall learn them:
their children also shall sit upon thy seat for evermore.
For the Lord hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself: he hath longed for
her.
This shall be my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.
I will bless her victuals with increase: and will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will deck her priests with health: and her saints shall rejoice and sing.
There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: I have ordained a lantern for
mine Anointed.
As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame: but upon himself shall his
crown flourish.
<h3>Psalm 132</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is: brethren, to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down unto the beard:
even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts of his clothing.
Like as the dew of Hermon: which fell upon the hill of Sion.
For there the Lord promised his blessing: and life for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 133</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD now, praise the Lord: all ye servants of the Lord;
Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord: even in the courts of the house of
our God.
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary: and praise the Lord.
The Lord that made heaven and earth: give thee blessing out of Sion.

<h3>Psalm 109</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool.
The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: be thou ruler, even in the
midst among thine enemies.
In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free-will offerings with an holy
worship: the dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning.
The Lord sware, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech..
The Lord upon thy right hand: shall wound even kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places with the dead bodies:
and smite in sunder the heads over divers countries.
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up his head.
<h3>Psalm 110</h3>
Alleluia
I WILL give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart: secretly among the
faithful, and in the congregation.
The works of the Lord are great: sought out of all of them that have pleasure
therein.
His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour: and his righteousness
endureth for ever.
The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvellous works: that they
ought to be had in remembrance.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he shall ever be mindful of his
covenant.
He hath shewed his people the power of his works: that he may give them the
heritage of the heathen.
The works of his hands are verity and judgement: all his commandments are
true.
They stand fast for ever and ever: and are done in truth and equity.
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever;
holy and reverend is his Name.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all
they that do thereafter; the praise of it endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 111</h3>
Alleluia
BLESSED is the man that feareth the Lord: he hath great delight in his
commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall be
blessed.
Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth
for ever.
Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness: he is merciful, loving, and
righteous.
A good man is merciful, and lendeth: and will guide his words with discretion.
For he shall never be moved: and the righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance.
He will not be afraid of any evil tidings: for his heart standeth fast, and believeth
in the Lord.
His heart is established, and will not shrink: until he see his desire upon his
enemies.
He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor: and his righteousness
remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him: he shall gnash with his teeth,
and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.

<h3>Psalm 112</h3>
Alleluia
PRAISE the Lord, ye servants: O praise the Name of the Lord.
Blessed be the Name of the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
The Lord's Name is praised: from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of
the same.
The Lord is high above all heathen and his glory above the heavens.
Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling so high: and yet
humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?
He taketh up the simple out of the dust: and lifteth the poor out of the mire;
That he may set him with the princes: even with the princes of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house: and to be a joyful mother of
children.
<h3>Psalm 113</h3>
Alleluia
WHEN Israel came out of Egypt: and the house of Jacob from among the strange
people.
Judah was his sanctuary: and Israel his dominion.
The sea saw that, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams: and the little hills like young sheep.
What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest: and thou Jordan, that thou wast
driven back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams: and ye little hills, like young sheep?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the God of
Jacob.
Who turned the hard rock into a standing water: and the flint-stone into a
springing well.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise: for thy
loving mercy and for thy truth's sake.
Wherefore shall the heathen say: Where is now their God?
As for our God, he is in heaven: he hath done whatsoever pleased him.
Their idols are silver and gold: even the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not.
They have ears, and hear not: noses have they and smell not.
They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not: neither speak
they through their throat.
They that make them are like unto them ; and so are all such as put their trust in
them.
But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their succour and defence.
Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
Ye that fear the Lord, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
The Lord hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us: even he shall bless the
house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.
He shall bless them that fear the Lord: both small and great.
The Lord shall increase you more and more: you and your children.
Ye are the blessed of the Lord: who made heaven and earth.
All the whole heavens are the Lord's: the earth hath he given to the children of
men.
The dead praise not thee, O Lord: neither all they that go down into silence.
But we will praise the Lord: from this time forth for evermore. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 114</h3>
Alleluia
I AM well pleased: that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer.
That he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call upon him as long as I
live.
The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of hell gat hold
upon me.
I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I will call upon the Name of the Lord: O
Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea, our God is merciful
The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.
Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul: for the Lord hath rewarded thee.
And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from tears, and my
feet from falling.
I will walk before the Lord: in the land of the living.

<h3>Psalm 115</h3>
Alleluia
I BELIEVED, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled: I said in my
haste, All men are liars.
What reward shall I give unto the Lord: for all the benefits that he hath done
unto me?
I will receive the cup of salvation: and call upon the Name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: right dear in the sight of
the Lord is the death of his saints.
Behold, O Lord, how that I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thine
handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the Name of
the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of all his people: in the courts of
the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 116</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, all ye heathen: praise him, all ye nations.
For his merciful kindness is ever more and more towards us: and the truth of the
Lord endureth for ever. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 117</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: because his mercy endureth for
ever.
Let Israel now confess that he is gracious: and that his mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
Yea, let them now that fear the Lord confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
I called upon the Lord in trouble: and the Lord heard me at large.
The Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man doeth unto me.
The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire
upon mine enemies.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in man.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in princes.
All nations compassed me round about: but in the Name of the Lord will I destroy
them.
They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side: but in the
Name of the Lord will I destroy them.
They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire among the thorns:
for in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.
Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but the Lord was my help.
The Lord is my strength, and my song: and is become my salvation.
The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous: the right hand of
the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass.
The right hand of the Lord hath the pre-eminence: the right hand of the Lord
bringeth mighty things to pass.
I shall not die, but live: and declare the works of the Lord.
The Lord hath chastened and corrected me: but he hath not given me over unto
death.
Open me the gates of righteousness: that I may go into them, and give thanks
unto the Lord.
This is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into it.
I will thank thee, for thou hast heard me: and art become my salvation.
The same stone which the builders refused: is become the head-stone in the
corner.
This is the Lord's doing: and it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath made: we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Help me now, O Lord: O Lord, send us now prosperity.
Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: we have wished you good
luck , ye that are of the house of the Lord.
God is the Lord who hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, yea,
even unto the horns of the altar.
Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: thou art my God, and I will praise thee.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for ever.

        </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the holy martyrs, hierarchs, the venerable and the departed, the </i>composition of Joseph, in Tone VI: </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The lecherous Pharaoh was drowned with all his warriors, * and Israel, crossing through the midst of the sea, * cried aloud exclaiming: * Let us chant unto the Lord God, * for He hath been glorified! Having enlightened those in darkness with your radiant intelligence and put to shame the impious tyrants, O martyrs, ye manifestly became victors, and have passed over to the never-waning Light. Resplendent in the beauties of the virtues, O holy hierarchs of Christ, ye choirs of the venerable, O only triumphal procession of the prophets and all the righteous, ye have entered the mansions of heaven. All the multitude of women who joined themselves unto Christ have with manly labors trampled underfoot him who by a grievous deception brought death upon Eve; wherefore they are blessed with divine hymns. Glory ..., For the reposed: O Christ Who in the beginning formed man out of the earth, in the habitations of the righteous, in places of ease, grant rest to the souls of Thy servants, we pray, in that Thou art supremely good. Now & ever ..., Thou hast been shown to be more sacred than the cherubim and the seraphim, O pure one who hast given birth to the Author of creation. Him do thou unceasingly entreat, that He have pity on thy servants, who glorify thee. </p><p><i class="note">Another canon, of the departed, the composition of Theophanes, in Tone VI: </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i></i> When Israel walked on foot in the sea as on dry land, * on seeing their pursuer Pharaoh drowned, * they cried: * Let us sing to God * a song of victory.  </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel. In the chambers of heaven the valiant martyrs always beseech Thee, O Christ. Grant that the faithful whom Thou hast translated from the earth may receive everlasting good things. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Grant rest, O Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants. O Thou Who hast adorned all things, Thou didst form man’s living substance midway between lowliness and majesty; wherefore, grant rest to the souls of Thy servants, O Savior. Glory ..., In the beginning Thou didst set me to be a dweller and husbandman in the garden of paradise; yet Thou didst eject me, who broke Thy commandment; but grant rest to the souls of Thy servants, O Savior. Now & ever ..., He Who of old fashioned our first mother Eve from Adam’s rib is clothed in flesh through thy most pure womb; and therewith He hath destroyed the might of death, O pure one. OODDEE  III..  </p><p><i class="note">Canon of All Saints </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Having established my thoughts upon the firm rock of Thy Faith, * make steadfast my soul, O Lord; * for I have Thee as my refuge * and confirmation, * O Good One. Subjected to bodily pangs, the spiritual athletes looked forward, rejoicing, to a painless reward; and they now dispel our many pangs with grace. Driving away the beasts of evil with steadfast mind, the divine hierarchs delivered the godly children of Christ unharmed by their malice. Having mortified carnal-mindedness, the choir of the venerable, willingly bowing under the yoke of the Lord, received life everlasting. Glory ... For the reposed: From everlasting fire, O Christ, deliver those who have passed from this life in piety, and grant them remission of debts and eternal delight, O Good One.

Having suffered lawfully and been adorned by Thee with crowns of victory, Thy martyrs, O Bestower of life, earnestly ask that everlasting honor be given unto the faithful who have passed away. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Grant rest, O Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants. Having first with many miracles and signs instructed me, the lost one, in latter times Thou didst abase Thyself as One compassionate; and having searched, Thou didst find and save me. Glory ..., They who come to Thee from the one who poureth forth unstable corruption do Thou cause to dwell joyously in the eternal mansions, O Good One, justifying them by faith and grace. Now & ever ..., There is none as immaculate as thee, O most pure Mother of God; for thou alone didst conceive in thy womb the true God Who is from before the ages, and hath destroyed the power of death. </p><h3>Ode IV</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of All Saints </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Lord, I have heard the report of Thee * and was afraid; * I have seen Thy works and was amazed. * Glory to Thy power, O Lord. Standing fast, the passion-bearers beheld the prideful one trampled under their feet; and in thanksgiving they glorified the Creator of all things. Armed with the splendors of words, the holy hierarchs save all from the darkness of heresies, leading them to the light of understanding. The venerable ones, consuming the material passions with an ardent understanding of God, were revealed to be burning coals, and are greatly glorified. Glory ..., For the reposed: O Lord Who hast dominion over the living and the dead, unto those whom Thou hast taken to Thyself grant rest with all who have been well-pleasing unto Thee.

Revealing knowledge greater than wisdom and the most perfect goodness of spiritual gifts, O Master, Thou didst unite the choirs of the martyrs to the angels. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Grant rest, O Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants. Grant that those who have passed over to Thee may receive Thy most pure glory, O Christ, wherein are the dwelling-places of those who are glad and the voices of pure rejoicing.

In psalms and hymns let us praise the company of women, for they were well pleasing unto God. Glory ..., For the reposed: Enroll Thy servants in the mansions of Thy righteous ones, O Lord, overlooking the offenses they committed in this life. Now & ever ..., Thou wast revealed to be she who hath delivered us from all the harm of the enemy, O Lady, entreating Christ, Who alone is compassionate. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Departed </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Illumine with Thy divine light, I pray, O Good One, * the souls of those who with love rise early to pray to Thee, * that they may know Thee, O Word of God, * as the true God, * Who recalleth us from the darkness of sin. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel. Sacrificing themselves to our glorious God as a sacred whole-burnt offering and the first-fruits of human nature, the martyrs ever win salvation for us. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Grant rest, O Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants. Grant a sojourn in heaven and generous gifts unto Thy faithful servants who have fallen asleep, O Lord, granting them deliverance from transgressions.

Now & ever ..., O Sovereign Lady of the world, He Who was born from thee became the might, song and salvation of those who perished, delivering from the gates of Hades those who bless thee with faith. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of All Saints </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Slain by the sea-monster of sin, * I cry unto Thee, O Christ: * Free me from corruption, * as Thou didst the prophet. Ye engulfed the noetic foe with the outpouring of your divine blood; and ye watered the hearts of the faithful, O passion-bearers. Having crucified yourselves to the world and the passions, O venerable ones, and ye holy hierarchs, ye have been deemed worthy of divine glory. As is meet, we bless the choir of the prophets and the assembly of honorable women, who contended well. Glory ..., For the reposed: With Thine elect give rest to the souls who have fallen asleep in times past, O God, overlooking their transgressions.

Glory ..., O Master, Who art the wellspring of life, make Thy servants to dwell amid the nourishment of paradise, for with divine courage they have departed unto Thee in faith; and do Thou lead up those who were bound chains. . Now & ever ..., Having broken the commandment of God, we returned to the earth; but because of thee, O Virgin, we have been elevated from earth to the heavens, shaking off the corruption of death. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of All Saints </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Hearkening to the hymnody of Thy venerable children * Thou didst bedew the burning furnace: * O Lord God of our fathers blessed art Thou! Let us honor with hymns the passion-bearers of Christ, who quenched the flame of cruel ungodliness with the showers of their blood.

The venerable and all-wise hierarchs, shining like the sun, enlighten the whole world with the rays of their teachings and the splendors of healings. O all ye glorious prophets and hierarchs, ye venerable and righteous ones, ye multitudes of martyrs and women: Preserve your whole flock unshaken by the demons.

Hope strengthened the choirs of the martyrs, and enkindled thereby they took wing to the love of Thee, thereby depicting beforehand the truly unshakable rest which is to come, which do Thou grant unto the faithful departed, O Good One. </p><p><i class="note">Refrain:</i> Grant rest, O Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants. Be Thou well-pleased, O Christ, that those who have departed in faith may receive Thy radiant and divine effulgence, granting them rest in the bosom of Abraham, and granting them everlasting blessedness, in that Thou alone art merciful. Glory ..., As Thou art good and full of tender compassion by nature, the Willer of mercies and the Abyss of compassion, those of this place of affliction and the shadow of death hast Thou taken away.

<h3>Psalm 1</h3>
BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
stood in the way of sinners: and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful.
But his delight is in the law of the Lord: and in his law will he exercise himself
day and night.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side: that will bring forth his
fruit in due season.
His leaf also shall not wither: and look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper.
As for the ungodly, it is not so with them: but they are like the chaff, which the
wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.
Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment: neither the
sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
But the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: and the way of the ungodly shall
perish.
<h3>Psalm 2</h3>
WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why do the people imagine a
vain thing?
The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together: against the
Lord, and against his Anointed.
Let us break their bonds asunder: and cast away their cords from us.
He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: the Lord shall have them
in derision.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath: and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Yet I have set my King: upon my holy hill of Sion.
I will preach the law, whereof the Lord hath said unto me: Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee.
Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance: and the
utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron: and break them in pieces like a
potter's vessel.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be learned, ye that are judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord in fear: and rejoice unto him with reverence.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way: if his wrath
be kindled, (yea, but a little,) blessed are all they that put their trust in
him.
<h3>Psalm 3</h3>
A psalm of David. When he fled from the presence of his son Absalom
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me: many are they that rise against
me.
Many one there be that say of my soul: There is no help for him in his God.
But thou, O Lord, art my defender: thou art my worship, and the lifter up of my
head.
I did call upon the Lord with my voice: and he heard me out of his holy hill.
I laid me down and slept, and rose up again: for the Lord sustained me.
I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people: that have set themselves
against me round about.
Up, Lord, and help me, O my God: for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the
cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.

<h3>Psalm 4</h3>
For the end. A song of David among the Psalms
HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast set me at liberty
when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour: and have such
pleasure in vanity, and seek after leasing?
Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that is godly: when
I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart, and in your chamber,
and be still.
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness: and put your trust in the Lord.
There be many that say: Who will shew us any good?
Lord, lift thou up: the light of thy countenance upon us.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart: since the time that their corn and wine and
oil increased.
I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest: for it is thou, Lord, only, that
makest me dwell in safety.
<h3>Psalm 5</h3>
For the end. A song of David concerning her that inherits
PONDER my words, O Lord: consider my meditation
O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King, and my God: for unto thee
will I make my prayer.
My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O Lord: early in the morning will I direct my
prayer unto thee, and will look up.
For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness: neither shall any devil
dwell with thee.
Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest all of them that
work vanity.
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor both the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude of thy
mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies: make thy way
plain before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in his mouth: their inward parts are very wickedness.
Their throat is an open sepulchre: they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own imaginations: cast
them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebelled
against thee.
And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: they shall ever be giving of
thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be
joyful in thee;
For thou, Lord, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous: and with thy favourable
kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
<h3>Psalm 6</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns for the eighth
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy
displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones are
vexed.
My soul also is sore troubled: but, Lord, how long wilt thou punish me?
Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's sake.
For in death no man remembereth thee: and who will give thee thanks in the pit?
I am weary of my groaning; every night wash I my bed: and water my couch with
my tears.
My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of all mine enemies.
Away from me, all ye that work vanity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my
weeping.
The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer.
All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed: they shall be turned back,
and put to shame suddenly.

<h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 7</h3>
A psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the Benjamite
O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all them that
persecute me, and deliver me;
Lest he devour my soul, like a lion, and tear it in pieces: while there is none to
help.
O Lord my God, if I have done any such thing: or if there be any wickedness in
my hands;
If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me: yea, I have delivered
him that without any cause is mine enemy,
Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me: yea, let him tread my life
down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.
Stand up, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignation of
mine enemies: arise up for me in the judgement that thou hast
commanded.
And so shall the congregation of the people come about thee: for their sakes
therefore lift up thyself again.
The Lord shall judge the people; give sentence with me, O Lord: according to my
righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in me.
O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end: but guide thou the just.
For the righteous God: trieth the very hearts and reins.
My help cometh of God: who preserveth them that are true of heart.
God is a righteous Judge, strong and patient: and God is provoked every day.
If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword: he hath bent his bow, and made it
ready.
He hath prepared for him the instruments of death: he ordaineth his arrows
against the persecutors
Behold, he travaileth with mischief: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth
ungodliness.
He hath graven and digged up a pit: and is fallen on himself into the destruction
that he made for other.
For his travail shall come upon his own head: and his wickedness shall fall on his
own pate.
I will give thanks unto the Lord, according to his righteousness: and I will praise
the Name of the Lord most High.
<h3>Psalm 8</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the winepresses
O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world: thou hast set
thy glory above the heavens!
Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength,
because of thine enemies: that thou mightest still the enemy and the
avenger.
For I will consider thy heavens, even the works of thy fingers: the moon and the
stars, which thou hast ordained.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him: and the son of man, that thou visitest
him?
Thou madest him lower than the angels: to crown him with glory and worship.
Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands: and thou hast put
all things in subjection under his feet;
All sheep and oxen: yea, and the beasts of the field;
The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and whatsoever walketh through
the paths of the seas.
O Lord our Governor: how excellent is thy Name in all the world!

<h3>Psalm9</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the secrets of the Son
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will speak of all thy
marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O thou
most Highest.
While mine enemies are driven back: they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in the throne that
judgest right.
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly: thou hast put out
their name for ever and ever.
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: even as the cities which
thou hast destroyed, their memorial is perished with them.
But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath also prepared his seat for judgement.
For he shall judge the world in righteousness: and minister true judgement unto
the people.
The Lord also will be a defence for the oppressed: even a refuge in due time of
trouble.
And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast
never failed them that seek thee.
O praise the Lord which dwelleth in Sion: show the people of his doings.
For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them :and forgetteth
not the complaint of the poor.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider the trouble which I suffer of them that
hate me: thou that liftest me up from the gates of death.
That I may shew all thy praises within the ports of the daughter of Sion: I will
rejoice in thy salvation.
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the same net which they
hid privily, is their foot taken.
The Lord is known to execute judgement: the ungodly is trapped in the work of
his own hands.
The wicked shall be turned into hell: and all the people that forget God.
For the poor shall not always be forgotten: the patient abiding of the meek shall
not perish for ever.
Up, Lord, and let not man have the upper hand: let the heathen be judged in thy
sight.
Put them in fear, O Lord: that the heathen may know themselves to be but men.
Why standest thou so far off, O Lord: and hidest thy face in the needful time of
trouble?
The ungodly for his own lust doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the
crafty wiliness that they have imagined.
For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire: and speaketh good of
the covetous, whom God abhorreth.
The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God ; neither is God in all his
thoughts.
His ways are always grievous: thy judgments are far above out of his sight, and
therefore defieth he all his enemies.
For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down: there shall no
harm happen unto me.
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is ungodliness
and vanity.
He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets: and privily in his lurking
dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.
For he lieth waiting secretly, even as a lion lurketh he in his den: that he may
ravish the poor.
He doth ravish the poor: when he getteth him into his net.
He falleth down, and humbleth himself: that the congregation of the poor may
fall into the hands of his captains.
He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face, and
he will never see it.
Arise, O Lord God, and lift up thine hand: forget not the poor.
Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God: while he doth say in his heart,
Tush, thou God carest not for it.
Surely thou hast seen it: for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong.
That thou mayest take the matter into thy hand: the poor committeth himself
unto thee; for thou art the helper of the friendless.
Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious: take away his ungodliness,
and thou shalt find none.
The Lord is King for ever and ever: and the heathen are perished out of the land.
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the poor: thou preparest their heart, and
thine ear hearkeneth thereto;
To help the fatherless and poor unto their right: that the man of the earth be no
more exalted against them.
<h3>Psalm10</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
IN THE Lord put I my trust: how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a
bird unto the hill?
For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the
quiver: that they may privily shoot at them which are true of heart.
For the foundations will be cast down: and what have the righteous done?
The Lord is in his holy temple: the Lord's seat is in heaven.
His eyes consider the poor: and his eye-lids try the children of men.
The Lord alloweth the righteous: but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in
wickedness, doth his soul abhor.
Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest:
this shall be their portion to drink.
For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness: his countenance will behold the
thing that is just

<h3>Psalm11</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, upon the eighth
HELP me, Lord, for there is not one godly man left: for the faithful are minished
from among the children of men,
They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour: they do but flatter with their
lips, and dissemble in their double heart.
The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips: and the tongue that speaketh proud
things;
Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail: we are they that ought to
speak , who is lord over us?
Now for the comfortless trouble's sake of the needy: and because of the deep
sighing of the poor,
I will up, saith the Lord: and will help every one from him that swelleth against
him, and will set him at rest.
The words of the Lord are pure words: even as the silver, which from the earth is
tried, and purified seven times in the fire.
Thou shalt keep them, O Lord: thou shalt preserve him from this generation for
ever.
The ungodly walk on every side: when they are exalted, the children of men are
put to rebuke.
<h3>Psalm12</h3>
For the end, psalm of David
HOW long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever: how long wilt thou hide thy face
from me?
How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart: how long
shall mine enemies triumph over me?
Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in
death.
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: for if I be cast down, they
that trouble me will rejoice at it.
But my trust is in thy mercy: and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.
I will sing of the Lord, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me: yea, I will
praise the Name of the Lord most Highest.
<h3>Psalm13</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE fool hath said in his heart: There is no God.
They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings: there is none that
doeth good, no not one.
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there
were any that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is none that doeth good, no not one.
Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have they deceived: the
poison of asps is under their lips.
Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood.
Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they not
known ; there is no fear of God before their eyes.
Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief: eating up my
people as it were bread, and call not upon the Lord?
There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was: for God is in the
generation of the righteous.
As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor: because he putteth
his trust in the Lord.
Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turneth the
captivity of his people: then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

<h3>Psalm14</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle: or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?
Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life: and doeth the thing which is right, and
speaketh the truth from his heart.
He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour: and
hath not slandered his neighbour.
He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes: and maketh much of
them that fear the Lord.
He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not: thou it were to
his own hindrance.
He that hath not given his money upon usury: nor taken reward against the
innocent.
Whoso doeth these things: shall never fall.
<h3>Psalm15</h3>
A writing of David
PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee have I put my trust.
O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, my goods are nothing
unto thee.
All my delight is upon the saints, that are in the earth: and upon such as excel in
virtue.
But they that run after another god: shall have great trouble.
Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer: neither make mention of their
names within my lips.
The Lord himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou shalt
maintain my lot.
The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will thank the Lord for giving me warning: my reins also chasten me in the
night-season.
I have set God always before me: for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not
fall.
Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiced: my flesh also shall rest in
hope.
For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell: neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy
One to see corruption.
Thou shalt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is the fulness of joy: and at
thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.
<h3>Psalm16</h3>
A prayer of David
HEAR the right, O Lord, consider my complaint: and hearken unto my prayer,
that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence: and let thine eyes look upon the
thing that is equal.
Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night-season; thou hast tried me,
and shalt find no wickedness in me; for I am utterly purposed that my
mouth shall not offend.
Because of men's works, that are done against the words of thy lips: I have kept
me from the ways of the destroyer.
O hold thou up my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps slip not.
I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: incline thine ear to me,
and hearken unto my words.
Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which
put their trust in thee: from such as resist thy right hand.
Keep me as the apple of an eye: hide me under the shadow of thy wings.
From the ungodly that trouble me: mine enemies compass me round about to
take away my soul.
They are enclosed in their own fat: and their mouth speaketh proud things.
They lie waiting in our way on every side: turning their eyes down to the ground.
Like of a lion that is greedy of his prey: and as it were a lion's whelp. lurking in
secret places.
Up, Lord, disappoint him, and cast him down: deliver my soul from the ungodly,
which is a sword of thine;
From the men of thy hand, O Lord, from the men, I say, and from the evil world:
which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid
treasure.
They have children at their desire: and leave the rest of their substance for their
babes.
But as for me, I will behold thy presence in righteousness: and when I awake up
after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied with it.</div>

<h3>Psalm 17</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David the servant of the Lord. The words which he spoke to the Lord,
even the words of this song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his
enemies, and out of the hand of Saul. And he said:
I WILL love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony rock, and my
defence: my saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust, my
buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.
I will call upon the Lord, which is worthy to be praised: so shall I be safe from
mine enemies.
The sorrows of death compassed me: and the overflowings of ungodliness made
me afraid.
The pains of hell came about me: the snares of death overtook me.
In my trouble I will call upon the Lord: and complain unto my God.
So shall he hear my voice out of his holy temple: and my complaint shall come
before him, it shall enter even into his ears.
The earth trembled and quaked: the very foundations also of the hills shook, and
were removed, because he was wroth.
There went a smoke out in his presence: and a consuming fire out of his mouth,
so that coals were kindled at it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and it was dark under his feet.
He rode upon the cherubim, and did fly: he came flying upon the wings of the
wind.
He made darkness his secret place: his pavilion round about him, with dark
water and thick clouds to cover him.
At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed: hail-stones and coals of
fire.
The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hailstones and coals of fire.
He sent out his arrows, and scattered them: he cast forth lightnings, and
destroyed them.
The springs of water were seen, and the foundations of the round world were
discovered, at thy chiding, O Lord: at the blasting of the breath of thy
displeasure.
He shall send down from on high to fetch me: and shall take me out of many
waters.
He shall deliver from me my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me: for
they are too mighty for me.
They prevented me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my upholder.
He brought me forth also into a place of liberty: he brought me forth even
because he had a favour unto me.
The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing: according to the cleanness
of my hands shall he recompense me.
Because I have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not forsaken my God, as the
wicked doth.
For I have an eye unto all his laws: and will not cast out his commandments from
me.
I was also uncorrupt before him: and eschewed mine own wickedness.
Therefore shall the Lord reward me after my righteous dealing: and according
unto the cleanness of my hands in his eye-sight.
With the holy thou shalt be holy: and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.
With the clean thou shalt be clean: and with the froward thou shalt learn
frowardness.
For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity: and shalt bring down the
high looks of the proud.
Thou also shalt light my candle: the Lord my God shall make my darkness to be
light.
For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men: and with the help of my God I shall
leap over the wall.
The way of God is an undefiled way: the word of the Lord also is tried in the fire;
he is the defender of all them that put their trust in him.
For who is God, but the Lord: or who hath any strength, except our God?
It is God, that girdeth me with strength of war: and maketh my way perfect.
He maketh my feet like harts' feet: and setteth me up on high.
He teacheth mine hands to fight: and mine arms shall break even a bow of steel.
Thou hast given me the defence of my salvation: thy right hand also shall hold
me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.
Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go: that my footsteps shall not
slide.
I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them: neither will I turn again till I
have destroyed them.
I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand: but fall under my feet.
Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou shalt throw done mine
enemies under me.
Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me: and I shall
destroy them that hate me.
They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them: yea, even unto the Lord
shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.
I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I will cast them out as the
clay in the streets.
Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people: and thou shalt make me
the head of the heathen.
A people whom I have not known: shall serve me.
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: but the strange children shall
dissemble with me.
The strange children shall fail: and be afraid out of their prisons.
The Lord liveth, and blessed be my strong helper: and praised be the Lord of my
salvation.
Even the God that seeth that I be avenged: and subdueth the people unto me.
It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine
adversaries: thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.
For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles: and sing
praises unto thy Name.
Great prosperity giveth he unto his King: and showeth loving-kindness unto
David his Anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.

<h3>Psalm 18</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament showeth his
handiwork.
One day telleth another: and one night certifieth another.
There is neither speech nor language: but their voices are heard among them.
Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words into the ends of the world.
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun: which cometh forth as a
bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.
It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the
end of it again: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, converting the soul: the testimony of the
Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: the commandment of
the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever: the judgments of the Lord
are true, and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also
than honey, and the honey-comb.
Moreover, by them is thy servant taught: and in keeping of them there is great
reward.
Who can tell how oft he offendeth: O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.
Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion over
me: so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart: be alway
acceptable in thy sight,
O Lord: my strength, and my redeemer.
<h3>Psalm 19</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the Name of the God of Jacob defend
thee;
Send thee help from the sanctuary: and strengthen thee out of Sion;
Remember all thy offerings: and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
Grant thee thy heart's desire: and fulfil all thy mind.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God:
the Lord perform all thy petitions.
Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Anointed, and will hear him from his holy
heaven: even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.
Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the
Name of the Lord our God.
They are brought down, and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, Lord and hear us, O King of heaven: when we call upon thee.
<h3>Psalm 20</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be of thy
salvation.
Thou hast given him his heart's desire: and hast not denied him the request of
his lips.
For thou shalt prevent him with the blessings of goodness: and shalt set a crown
of pure gold upon his head.
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life: even for ever and ever.
His honour is great in thy salvation: glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon
him.
For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity: and make him glad with the joy of thy
countenance.
And why? because the King putteth his trust in the Lord: and in the mercy of the
most Highest he shall not miscarry.
All thine enemies shall feel thine hand: thy right hand shall find out them that
hate thee.
Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: the Lord shall
destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.
Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth: and their seed from among the
children of men.
For they intended mischief against thee: and imagined such a device as they are
not able to perform.
Therefore shalt thou put them to flight: and the strings of thy bow shalt thou
make ready against the face of them.
Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so we will sing, and praise thy
power.

<h3>Psalm 21</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the morning aid.
MY GOD, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me: and art so far from
my health, and from the words of my complaint?
O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not: and in the night-season
also I take no rest.
And thou continuest holy: O thou worship of Israel.
Our fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them.
They called upon thee, and were holpen: they put their trust in thee, and were
not confounded.
But as for me, I am a worm, and no man: a very scorn of men, and the outcast of
the people.
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot our their lips, and shake their
heads, saying,
He trusted in God, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, if he will have
him.
But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: thou wast my hope, when
I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.
I have been left unto thee ever since I was born: thou art my God, even from my
mother's womb.
O go not from me, for trouble is hard at hand: and there is none to help me.
Many oxen are come about me: fat bulls of Basan close me in on every side.
They gape upon me with their mouths: as it were a ramping and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart also in the
midst of my body is even like melting wax.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my gums: and
thou shalt bring me into the dust of death.
For many dogs are come about me: and the council of the wicked layeth siege
against me.
They pierced my hands and my feet; I may tell all my bones: they stand staring
and looking upon me.
They part my garments among them: and casts lots upon my vesture.
But be not thou far from me, O Lord: thou art my succour, haste thee to help me.
Deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth: thou hast heard me also from among the horns of
the unicorns.
I will declare thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I
praise thee.
O praise the Lord, ye that fear him: magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob, and
fear him, all ye seed of Israel.
For he hath not despised, nor abhorred, the low estate of the poor: he hath not
hid his face from him, but when he called unto him he heard him.
My praise is of thee in the great congregation: my vows will I perform in the
sight of them that fear him.
The poor shall eat and be satisfied: they that seek after the Lord shall praise him;
your heart shall live for ever.
All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned unto the
Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him.
For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the Governor among the people.
All such as be fat upon earth: have eaten and worshipped.
All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him: and no man hath
quickened his own soul.
My seed shall serve him: they shall be counted unto the Lord for a generation.
They shall come, and the heavens shall declare his righteousness: unto a people
that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.
<h3>Psalm 22</h3>
A psalm of David
THE Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside the waters of
comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness, for
his Name's sake.
Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort me.
Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble me: thou hast
anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.
But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
<h3>Psalm 23</h3>
A psalm of David on the first day of the week
THE earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and
they that dwell therein.
For he hath founded it upon the seas: and prepared it upon the floods.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall rise up in his holy place?
Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart: and that hath not lift up his
mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord: and righteousness from the God of
his salvation.
This is the generation of them that seek him: even of them that seek thy face, O
Jacob.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: it is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty
in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: even the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.

<h3>Psalm 24</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my trust in thee: O
let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.
For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed: but such as transgress
without a cause shall be put to confusion.
Shew me thy ways, O Lord: and teach me thy paths.
Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God of my salvation; in
thee hath been my hope all the day long.
Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender mercies: and thy loving-kindnesses,
which have been ever of old.
O remember not the sins and offences of my youth: but according to thy mercy
think thou upon me, O Lord, for thy goodness.
Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Them that are meek shall he guide in judgement: and such as are gentle, them
shall he learn his way.
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth: unto such as keep his covenant
and his testimonies.
For thy Name's sake, O Lord: be merciful unto my sin, for it is great.
What man is he that feareth the Lord: him shall he teach in the way that he shall
choose.
His soul shall dwell at ease: and his seed shall inherit the land.
The secret of the Lord is among them that fear him: and he will show them his
covenant.
Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out of the
net.
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am desolate and in misery.
The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my troubles.
Look upon my adversity and misery: and forgive me all my sin.
Consider mine enemies, how many they are: and they bear a tyrannous hate
against me.
O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be confounded, for I have put my
trust in thee.
Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me: for my hope hath been in
thee.
Deliver Israel, O God: out of all his troubles.
<h3>Psalm 25</h3>
A psalm of David
BE THOU my judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently: my trust hath been
also in the Lord, therefore shall I not fall.
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me: try out my reins and my heart.
For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes: and I will walk in thy truth.
I have not dwelt with vain persons: neither will I have fellowship with the
deceitful.
I have hated the congregation of the wicked: and will not sit among the ungodly.
I will wash my hands in innocency, O Lord: and so will I go to thine altar.
That I may show the voice of thanksgiving: and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house: and the place where thine honour
dwelleth.
O shut not up my soul with the sinners: nor my life with the blood-thirsty.
In whose hands is wickedness: and their right hand is full of gifts.
But as for me, I will walk innocently: O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.
My foot standeth right: I will praise the Lord in the congregations.
<h3>Psalm 26</h3>
A psalm of David before he was anointed
THE Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom then shall I fear: the Lord is the
strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my
flesh: they stumbled and fell.
Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid:
and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.
One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may dwell
in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of
the Lord, and to visit his temple.
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle: yea, in the secret
place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone.
And now shall he lift up mine head: above mine enemies round about me.
Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness: I will sing,
and speak praises unto the Lord.
Hearken unto my voice, O Lord, when I cry unto thee: have mercy upon me, and
hear me.
My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: Thy face, Lord, will I seek.
O hide not thou thy face from me: nor cast thy servant away in displeasure.
Thou hast been my succour: leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me: the Lord taketh me up.
Teach me the way, O Lord: and lead in the right way, because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: for there are false
witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.
I should utterly have fainted: but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the
Lord in the land of the living.
O tarry thou the Lord's leisure: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart ; and
put thou thy trust in the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 27</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee will I cry, O Lord my strength: think no scorn of me; lest, if thou
make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go down into the
pit.
Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee: when I hold up my
hands towards the mercy-seat of thy holy temple.
O pluck me not away, neither destroy me, with the ungodly and wicked doers:
which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mischief in their
hearts.
Reward them according to their deeds: and according to the wickedness of their
own inventions.
Recompense them after the work of their hands: pay them that they have
deserved.
For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his
hands: therefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.
Praised be the Lord: for he hath heard the voice of my humble petitions.
The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and I am
helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise
him.
The Lord is my strength: and he is the wholesome defence of his Anointed.
O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: feed them , and
set them up for ever.
<h3>Psalm 28</h3>
A psalm of David on the occasion of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle
BRING unto the Lord, O ye mighty, bring young rams unto the Lord: ascribe unto
the Lord worship and strength.
Give the Lord the honour due unto his Name: worship the Lord with holy
worship.
It is the Lord that commandeth the waters: it is the glorious God that maketh the
thunder.
It is the Lord that ruleth the sea; the voice of the Lord is mighty in operation: the
voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar-trees: yea, the Lord breaketh the
cedars of Libanus.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf: Libanus also, and Sirion, like a young
unicorn.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the Lord shaketh
the wilderness: yea, the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Cades.
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and discovereth the
thick bushes: in his temple doth every man speak of his honour.
The Lord sitteth above the water -flood: and the Lord remaineth a King for ever.
The Lord shall give strength unto his people: the Lord shall give his people the
blessing of peace.
<h3>Psalm 29</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song at the dedication of the house of David
I WILL magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up: and not made my foes to
triumph over me.
O Lord my God, I cried unto thee: and thou hast healed me.
Thou, Lord, hast brought my soul out of hell: thou hast kept my life from them
that go down to the pit.
Sing praises unto the Lord, O ye saints of his: and give thanks unto him for a
remembrance of his holiness.
For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his pleasure is life:
heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: thou, Lord, of thy
goodness hast made my hill so strong.
Thou didst turn thy face from me: and I was troubled.
Then cried I unto thee, O Lord: and gat me to my Lord right humbly.
What profit is there in my blood: when I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust give thanks unto thee: or shall it declare thy truth?
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.
Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and
girded me with gladness.
Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing: O my God, I
will give thanks unto thee for ever.

<h3>Psalm 30</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David; an utterance of extreme fear
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion, deliver
me in thy righteousness.
Bow down thine ear to me: make haste to deliver me.
And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence: that thou mayest save me.
For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: be thou also my guide, and lead me
for thy Name's sake.
Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my
strength.
Into thy hands I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou
God of truth.
I have hated them that hold of superstitious vanities: and my trust hath been in
the Lord.
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble, and
hast known my soul in adversities.
Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: but hast set my feet in a
large room.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord , for I am in trouble: and mine eye is consumed for
very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.
For my life is waxen old with heaviness: and my years with mourning.
My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity: and my bones are consumed.
I became a reproof among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours: and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me; and they
that did see me without conveyed themselves from me.
I am clean forgotten, as a dead man out of mind: I am become like a broken
vessel.
For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude: and fear is on every side, while
they conspire together against me, and take their counsel to take away my
life.
But my hope hath been in thee, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my God.
My time is in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies: and from
them that persecute me.
Shew thy servant the light of thy countenance: and save me for thy mercy's sake.
Let me not be confounded, O Lord for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be
put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.
Let the lying lips be put to silence: which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully,
speak against the righteous.
O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee:
and that thou hast prepared for them that put their trust in thee, even
before the sons of men!
Thou shalt hide them privily by thine own presence from the provoking of all
men: thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle from the strife of
tongues.
Thanks be to the Lord: for he hath shewed me marvellous great kindness in a
strong city.
And when I made haste, I said: I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.
Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer: when I cried unto thee.
26.O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth them that are
faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.
Be strong, and he shall establish your heart: all that ye put your trust in the
Lord.
<h3>Psalm 31</h3>
A psalm of instruction by David
BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven: and whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no sin: and in whose spirit
there is no guile.
For while I held my tongue: my bones consumed away through my daily
complaining.
For thy hand is heavy upon me day and night: and my moisture is like the
drought in summer.
I will acknowledge my sin unto thee: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.
I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord: and so thou forgavest the wickedness
of my sin.
For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a time when
thou mayest be found: but in the great water-floods they shall not come
nigh him.
Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shalt preserve me from trouble: thou shalt
compass me about with songs of deliverance.
I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go: and I will
guide thee with mine eyes.
Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding: whose mouths
must be held with bit and bridle. lest they fall upon thee.
Great plagues remain for the ungodly: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord,
mercy embraceth him on every side.
Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord: and be joyful, all ye that are true
of heart.

<h3>Psalm 32</h3>
A psalm of David
REJOICE in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to be thankful.
Praise the Lord with harp: sing praises unto him with the lute, and instrument of
ten strings.
Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing praises lustily unto him with a good
courage.
For the word of the Lord is true: and all his works are faithful.
He loveth righteousness and judgement: the earth is full of the goodness of the
Lord.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the hosts of them by the
breath of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap: and layeth
up the deep, as in a treasure-house.
Let all the earth fear the Lord: stand in awe of him, all ye that dwell in the world.
For he spake, and it was done: he commanded and it stood fast.
The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: and maketh the devices
of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the counsels of princes.
The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever: and the thoughts of his heart from
generation to generation.
Blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord Jehovah: and blessed are the folk,
that he hath chosen to him to be his inheritance.
The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the children of men: from the
habitation of his dwelling he considereth all them that dwell on the earth.
He fashioneth all the hearts of them: and understandeth all their works.
There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host: neither is any
mighty man delivered by much strength.
A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man: neither shall he deliver any
man by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him: and upon them that put
their trust in his mercy.
To deliver their soul from death: and to feed them in the time of dearth.
Our soul hath patiently tarried for the Lord: for he is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in him: because we have hoped in his holy Name.
Let thy merciful kindness, O Lord, be upon us: like as we do put our trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 33</h3>
A psalm of David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech, and he was dismissed
and departed
I WILL alway give thanks unto the Lord: his praise shall ever be in my mouth.
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be
glad.
O praise the Lord with me: and let us magnify his Name together.
I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he delivered me out of all my fear.
They had an eye unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
ashamed.
Lo, the poor crieth, and the Lord heareth him: yea, and saveth him out of all his
troubles.
The angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him: and delivereth
them.
O taste, and see, how gracious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusteth in
him.
O fear the Lord, ye that are his saints: for they that fear him lack nothing.
The lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they who seek the Lord shall want no
manner of thing that is good.
Come, ye children, and hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
What man is he that lusteth to live: and would fain see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil: and thy lips, that they speak no guile.
Eschew evil, and do good: seek peace, and ensue it.
The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous: and his ears are open unto their
prayers.
The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil: to root out the
remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them: and delivereth them out of all
their troubles.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and will save such as be
of an humble spirit.
Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of all.
He keepeth all his bones: so that not one of them is broken.
But misfortune shall slay the ungodly: and they that hate the righteous shall be
desolate.
The Lord delivereth the souls of his servants: and all they that put their trust in
him shall not be destitute.

<h3>Psalm 34</h3>
A psalm of David
PLEAD thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: and fight thou
against them that fight against me.
Lay hand upon the shield and buckler: and stand up to help me.
Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto
my soul, I am thy salvation.
Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seek after my soul :let them be
turned back and brought to confusion, that imagine mischief for me.
Let them be as the dust before the wind: and the angel of the Lord scattering
them.
Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord persecute them.
For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause: yea, even
without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.
Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net, that he hath laid
privily, catch himself: that he may fall into his own mischief.
And, my soul, be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, who deliverest the poor from
him that is too strong for him: yea, the poor, and him that is in misery, from
him that spoileth him?
False witnesses did rise up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
They rewarded me evil for good: to the great discomfort of my soul.
Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with
fasting.: and my prayer shall turn into mine own bosom.
I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother: I went heavily,
as one that mourneth for his mother.
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the
very abjects came together against me unawares, making mouths at me,
and ceased not.
With the flatterers were busy mockers: who gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, how long wilt though look upon this: O deliver my soul from the calamities
which they bring on me, and my darling from the lions.
So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among
much people.
O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly: neither let them
wink with their eyes that they hate me without a cause.
And why? their communing is not for peace; but they imagine deceitful words
against them that are quiet in the land.
They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said: Fie on thee, fie on thee, we
saw it with our eyes.
This thou hast seen, O Lord: hold not thy tongue then, go not far from me, O
Lord.
Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel: avenge thou my cause, my God, and
my Lord.
Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness: and let them not
triumph over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, There, there, so would we have it: neither let
them say, We have devoured him.
Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at my trouble: let
them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that boast themselves against
me.
Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing: yea, let them say
alway, Blessed be the Lord, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
servant.
And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness: and of thy praise
all the day long.
<h3>Psalm 35</h3>
For the end. By David the servant of the Lord
MY HEART sheweth me the wickedness of the ungodly: that there is no fear of
God before his eyes.
For he flattereth himself in his own sight: until his abominable sin be found out.
The words of his mouth are unrighteous, and full of deceit: he hath left off to
behave himself wisely, and to do good.
He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good way:
neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.
Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth unto the heavens: and thy faithfulness unto the
clouds.
Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: thy judgments are like the
great deep.
Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast; How excellent is thy mercy, O God:
and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy
wings.
They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house: and thou shalt give
them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.
For with thee is the well of life: and in thy light shall we see light.
O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee: and thy
righteousness unto them that are true of heart.
O let not the foot of pride come against me: and let not the hand of the ungodly
cast me down.
There are they fallen, all that work wickedness: they are cast down, and shall not
be able to stand.

<h3>Psalm 36</h3>
A psalm of David
FRET not thyself because of the ungodly: neither be thou envious against the
evil-doers.
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass: and be withered even as the
green herb.
Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good: dwell in the land, and verily
thou shalt be fed.
Delight thou in the Lord: and he shall give thee thy heart's desire.
Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him: and he shall bring it to
pass.
He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light ; and thy just dealing as the
noon-day.
Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon him: but grieve not thyself at
him whose way doth prosper, against the man that doeth after evil
counsels.
Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: fret not thyself, else shalt thou be
moved to do evil.
Wicked doers shall be rooted out: and they that patiently abide the Lord, those
shall inherit the land.
Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: thou shalt look after his
place, and he shall be away.
But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth: and shall be refreshed in the
multitude of peace.
The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just: and gnasheth upon him with his
teeth.
The Lord shall laugh him to scorn: for he hath seen that his day is coming.
The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow: to cast down
the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of a right conversation.
Their sword shall go through their own heart: and their bow shall be broken.
A small thing that the righteous hath: is better than great riches of the ungodly.
For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken: and the Lord upholdeth the
righteous.
The Lord knoweth the days of the godly: and their inheritance shall endure for
ever.
They shall not be confounded in the perilous time: and in the days of dearth they
shall have enough.
As for the ungodly, they shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord shall consume
as the fat of lambs: yea, even as the smoke shall they consume away.
The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous is merciful and
liberal.
Such as are blessed of God shall possess the land: and they that are cursed of
him shall be rooted out.
The Lord ordereth a good man's going: and maketh his way acceptable to
himself.
Though he fall, he shall not be cast away: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
hand.
I have been young, and now am old: and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging their bread.
The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth: and his seed is blessed.
Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good: and dwell for evermore.
For the Lord loveth the thing that is right: he forsaketh not his that be godly, but
they are preserved for ever.
The unrighteous shall be punished: as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be
rooted out.
The righteous shall inherit the land: and dwell therein forever.
The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and his tongue will be talking
of judgement.
The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not slide.
The ungodly seeth the righteous: and seeketh occasion to slay him.
The Lord will not leave him in his hand: nor condemn him when he is judged.
Hope thou in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee, that thou
shalt possess the land: when the ungodly shall perish, thou shalt see it.
I myself have seen the ungodly in great power: and flourishing like a green baytree.
I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him, but his place could no where be
found.
Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right: for that shall bring a
man peace at the last.
As for the transgressors, they shall perish together: and the end of the ungodly
is, they shall be rooted out at the last.
But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord: who is also their strength
in the time of trouble.
And the Lord shall stand by them, and save them: he shall deliver them from the
ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him.

        <div><h4>First Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 37</h3>
A psalm of David . For remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day
PUT me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy heavy
displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me: and thy hand presseth me sore.
There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure: neither is there any
rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.
For my wickednesses are gone over my head: and are like a sore burden, too
heavy for me to bear.
My wounds stink, and are corrupt: through my foolishness.
I am brought into so great trouble and misery: that I go mourning all the day
long.
For my loins are filled with a sore disease: and there is no whole part in my body.
I am feeble, and sore smitten: I have roared for the very disquietness of my
heart.
Lord, thou knowest all my desire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me: and the sight of mine eyes is gone
from me.
My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble: and my
kinsmen stood afar off.
They also that sought after my life laid snares for me: and they that went about
to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit all the day long.
As for me I was like a deaf men, and heard not: and as one that is dumb, who
doth not open his mouth.
I became even as a man that heareth not: and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my
God.
I have required that they, even mine enemies should not triumph over me: for
when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me.
And I, truly, am set in the plague: and my heaviness is ever in my sight.
For I will confess my wickedness: and be sorry for my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are mighty: and they that hate me wrongfully are
many in number.
They also that reward evil for good are against me: because I follow the thing
that good is.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me.
Haste thee to help me: O Lord God of my salvation.
<h3>Psalm 38</h3>
For the end. A song of David, for Idithun
I SAID, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not in my tongue.
I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle: while the ungodly is in my sight.
I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even from good words;
but it was pain and grief to me.
My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire kindled: and at
the last I spake with my tongue;
Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may be certified
how long I have to live.
Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long: and mine age is even as
nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is altogether vanity.
For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth
up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.
And now, Lord, what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.
Deliver me from all mine offences: and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.
I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.
Take thy plague away from me: I am even consumed by the means of thy heavy
hand.
When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to
consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man
therefore is but vanity.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling: hold not thy
peace at my tears.
For I am a stranger with thee: and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence, and be no
more seen
<h3>Psalm 39</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
I WAITED patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and heard my calling.
He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay: and set my
feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth: even a thanksgiving unto our God.
Many shall see it, and fear: and shall put their trust in the Lord.
Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the Lord: and turned not unto the
proud, and to such as go about with lies.
O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like as be
also thy thoughts which are to us-ward: and yet there is no man that
ordereth them unto thee:
If I should declare them, and speak of them: they should be more than I am able
to express.
Sacrifice and meat-offering thou wouldest not: but mine ears hast thou opened.
Burnt-offerings, and sacrifice for sin, hast thou not required: then said I, Lo, I
come,
In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil thy will, O my
God: I am content to do it; yea, thy law is within my heart.
I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I will not refrain
my lips, O Lord, and that thou knowest.
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart: my talk hath been of thy truth
and of thy salvation.
I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth: from the great congregation.
Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord: let thy loving-kindness and thy
truth alway preserve me.
For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such hold upon
me that I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the
hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.
O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me: make haste, O Lord, to help me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after my soul to
destroy it: let them be driven backward and put to rebuke, that wish me
evil.
Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame: that say unto me, Fie upon
thee, fie upon thee.
Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let such as love thy
salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and needy: but the Lord careth for me.
Thou art my helper and redeemer: make no long tarrying, O my God.

<h3>Psalm 40</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him
in the time of trouble.
The Lord preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth:
and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.
The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick upon his bed: make thou all his bed in
his sickness.
I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies speak evil of me: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: and his heart conceiveth falsehood
within himself, and when he cometh forth he telleth it.
All mine enemies whisper together against me: even against me do they imagine
this evil.
Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him: and now that he lieth, let him
rise up no more.
Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted: who did also eat of my
bread, hath laid great wait for me.
But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord: raise thou me up again, and I shall reward
them.
By this I know thou favourest me: that mine enemy doth not triumph against me.
And when I am in my health, thou upholdest me: and shalt set me before thy face
for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: world without end. Amen.
<h3>Psalm 41</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: when shall I come to
appear before the presence of God?
My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where
is now thy God?
Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the
multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;
In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day.
Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted
within me?
Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his
countenance.
My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore will I remember thee concerning
the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermon.
One deep calleth another, because of the noise of the water-pipes: all thy waves
and storms are gone over me.
The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time: and in the nightseason did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me: why go I
thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword: while mine enemies that trouble
me cast me in the teeth;
Namely, while they say daily unto me: Where is now thy God?
Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.
<h3>Psalm 42</h3>
A psalm of David
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people:
O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.
For thou art the God of my strength, why hast thou put me from thee: and why
go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me: and bring me unto thy
holy hill, and to thy dwelling.
And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and
gladness: and upon the harp I will give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.

<h3>Psalm 43</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
WE HAVE heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us: what thou hast
done in their time of old;
How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted them in: how
thou hast destroyed the nations and cast them out.
For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword: neither was it
their own arm that helped them;
But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance: because
thou hadst a favour unto them.
Thou art my King, O God: send help unto Jacob.
Through thee will we overthrow our enemies: and in thy Name will we tread
them under, that rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow: it is not my sword that shall help me;
But it is thou that savest us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion that
hate us.
We make our boast of God all day long: and will praise thy Name for ever.
But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion: and goest not forth with our
armies.
Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies: so that they which hate us
spoil our goods.
Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep: and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Thou sellest thy people for nought: and takest no money for them.
Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours: to be laughed to scorn, and had
in derision of them that are round about us.
Thou makest us to be a by-word among the heathen: and that the people shake
their heads at us.
My confusion is daily before me: and the shame of my face hath covered me;
For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer: for the enemy and avenger.
And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee: nor behave
ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.
Our heart is not turned back: neither our steps gone out of thy way;
No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons: and covered us with
the shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to any
strange God: shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very secrets of
the heart.
For thy sake also are we killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep
appointed to be slain.
Up, Lord, why sleepest thou: awake, and be not absent from us for ever.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face: and forgettest our misery and trouble?
For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
ground.
Arise, and help us: and deliver us for thy mercy's sake.
<h3>Psalm 44</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses by the sons of Core, for instruction. A Song concerning the
beloved
MY HEART is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the thing which I have made
unto the King.
My tongue is the pen: of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, because God
hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most Mighty: according to thy
worship and renown.
Good luck have thou with thine honour: ride on, because of the word of truth , of
meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible
things.
Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be subdued unto thee: even in
the midst among the King's enemies.
Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, even thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia: out of the ivory palaces,
whereby they have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did
stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, incline thine ear ; forget also thine own
people, and thy father's house.
So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty: for his is thy Lord God, and
worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: like as the rich also among
the people shall make their supplication before thee.
The King's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work: the virgins that be
her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee.
With joy and gladness shall they be brought: and shall enter into the King's
palace.
Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children: whom thou mayest make princes
in all lands.
I will remember thy Name from one generation to another: therefore shall the
people give thanks unto thee, world without end.
<h3>Psalm 45</h3>
For the end. For the sons of Core; a psalm concerning secret things
GOD is our hope and strength: a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved: and though the hills be
carried into the midst of the sea;
Though the waters thereof rage and swell: and though the mountains shake at
the tempest of the same.
The rivers of the flood thereof shall make glad the city of God: the holy place of
the tabernacle of the most Highest.
God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed: God shall help
her, and that right early.
The heathen make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved: but God hath shewed
his voice, and the earth shall melt away.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.
O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord: what destruction he hath
brought upon the earth.
He maketh wars to cease in all the world: he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the
spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.
Be still then, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I
will be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O CLAP your hand together, all ye people: O sing unto God with the voice of
melody.
For the Lord is high, and to be feared: he is the great King upon all the earth.
He shall subdue the people under us: and the nations under our feet.
He shall choose out an heritage for us: even the worship of Jacob, whom he
loved.
God is gone up with a merry noise: and the Lord with the sound of the trump.
O sing praises, sing praises unto our God: O sing praises, sing praises unto our
King.
For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon his holy seat.
The princes of the people are joined unto the people of the God of Abraham: for
God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the earth, as it were with a
shield.
<h3>Psalm 47</h3>
A psalm of praise for the sons of Core on the second day of the week
GREAT is the Lord, and highly to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his
holy hill.
The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth: upon the north-side
lieth the city of the great King; God is well known in her palaces as a sure
refuge.
For lo, the kings of the earth: are gathered, and gone by together.
They marvelled to see such things: they were astonished, and suddenly cast
down.
Fear came there upon them, and sorrow: as upon a woman in her travail.
Thou shalt break the ships of the sea: through the east wind.
Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the
city of our God: God upholdeth the same for ever.
We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God: in the midst of thy temple.
O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's end: thy right
hand is full of righteousness.
Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad: because of thy
judgements.
Walk about Sion, and go round about her: and tell the towers thereof.
Mark well her bulwarks, set up her houses: that ye may tell them that come
after.
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he shall be our guide unto death.
<h3>Psalm 48</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O HEAR ye this, all ye people: ponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the
world;
High and low, rich and poor: one with another.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom: and my heart shall muse of understanding.
I will incline mine ear to the parable: and shew my dark speech upon the harp.
Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness: and when the wickedness of
my heels compasseth me round about?
There be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches.
But no man may deliver his brother: nor make agreement unto God for him;
For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that alone for ever;
Yea, though he live long: and see not the grave.
For he seeth that wise men also die, and perish together: as well as the ignorant
and foolish, and leave their riches for other.
And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever: and that their
dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the
lands after their own names.
Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour: seeing that he may be compared
unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them.
This is their foolishness: and their posterity praise their saying.
They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and the righteous shall
have domination over them in the morning: their beauty shall consume in
the sepulchre out of their dwelling.
But God hath delivered my soul from the place of hell: for he shall receive me.
Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich: or if the glory of his house be
increased.
For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth: neither shall his pomp
follow him.
For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man: and so long as thou doest
well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.
He shall follow the generation of his fathers: and shall never see light.
Man being in honour hath no understanding: but is compared unto the beasts
that perish.

<h3>Psalm 49</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
THE Lord, even the most mighty God, hath spoken: and called the world, from
the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Out of Sion hath God appeared: in perfect beauty.
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: there shall go before him a
consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up round about him.
He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth, that he may judge his people.
Gather my saints together unto me: those that have made a covenant with me
with sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is Judge himself.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak: I myself will testify against thee, O Israel;
for I am God, even thy God.
I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt-offerings:
because they were not alway before me.
I will take no bullock out of thine house: nor he-goat out of thy folds.
For all the beasts of the forest are mine: and so are the cattle upon a thousand
hills.
I know all the fowls upon the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are in
my sight.
If I be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the whole world is mine, and all that is
therein.
Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh: and drink the blood of goats?
Offer unto God thanksgiving: and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.
And call upon me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise
me.
But unto the ungodly said God: Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my
covenant in thy mouth;
Whereas thou hatest to be reformed: and has cast my words behind thee?
When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him: and hast been partaker
with the adulterers.
Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness: and with thy tongue thou hast set
forth deceit.
Thou satest, and spakest against thy brother: yea, and hast slandered thine own
mother's son.
These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest
wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and
set before thee the things that thou hast done.
O consider this, ye that forget God: lest I pluck you away, and there be none to
deliver you.
Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation right will I shew the salvation of God.
<h3>Psalm 50</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to
Bathsheba
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according to the
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.
Wash me throughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.
Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin hath my mother conceived me.
But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand
wisdom secretly.
Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice.
Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.
Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health: and
my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.
Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy praise.
For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou delightest not in
burnt-offerings.
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt
thou not despise.
O be favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burntofferings and oblations: then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine
altar.

<h3>Psalm 51</h3>
For the end. A psalm of instruction by David, when Doeg the Idumean came and told Saul that
David had gone to the house of Abimelech
WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant: that thou canst do mischief;
Whereas the goodness of God: endureth yet daily?
Thy tongue imagineth wickedness: and with lies thou cuttest like a sharp rasor.
Thou hast loved unrighteousness more then goodness: and to talk of lies more
than righteousness.
Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt: O thou false tongue.
Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever: he shall take thee, and pluck thee out
of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of the living.
The righteous also shall see this, and fear: and shall laugh him to scorn;
Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength: but trusted unto the
multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: my trust is in the
tender mercy of God for ever and ever.
I will always give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done: and I will hope in thy
Name, for thy saints like it well.
<h3>Psalm 52</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David upon Maeleth, of instruction
THE foolish body hath said in his heart: There is no God.
Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness: there is none that
doeth good.
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there were any
that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is also none that doeth good, no not one.
Are not they without understanding, that work wickedness: eating up my people
as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.
They were afraid where no fear was: for God hath broken the bones of him that
besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because God hath despised
them.
O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion: O that the Lord would
deliver his people out of captivity!
Then should Jacob rejoice: and Israel should be right glad.
<h3>Psalm 53</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of instruction by David. When the Ziphites came and said to Saul,
Lo, is not David hid with us?
SAVE me, O God, for thy Name's sake: and avenge me in thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God: and hearken unto the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me: and tyrants, which have not God before
their eyes, seek after my soul.
Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy truth.
An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O Lord: because
it is so comfortable.
For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire
upon mine enemies.
<h3>Psalm 54</h3>
For the end. Among hymns of instruction by David
HEAR my prayer, O God: and hide not thyself from my petition.
Take heed unto me, and hear me: how I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed.
The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast: for they are minded to
do me some mischief; so maliciously are they set against me.
My heart is disquieted within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me: and an horrible dread hath
overwhelmed me.
And I said, O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I flee away, and be at
rest.
Lo, then would I get me away far off: and remain in the wilderness.
I would make haste to escape: because of the stormy wind and tempest.
Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them: for I have spied unrighteousness
and strife in the city.
Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow
are in the midst of it.
Wickedness is therein: deceit and guile go not out of their streets.
For it is not an open enemy, that hath done me this dishonour: for then I could
have borne it.
Neither was it mine adversary, that did magnify himself against me: for then
peradventure I would have hid myself from him.
But it was even thou, my companion: my guide, and mine own familiar friend.
We took sweet counsel together: and walked in the house of God as friends.
Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for
wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord shall save me.
In the evening, and morning, and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly: and
he shall hear my voice.
It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
for there were many with me.
Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them down: for
they will not turn, nor fear God.
He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him: and he brake his covenant.
The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart: his
words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very swords.
O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: and shall not suffer
the righteous to fall for ever.
And as for them: thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction.
The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days:
nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.

<h3>Psalm 55</h3>
For the end. Concerning the people that were removed from the sanctuary. By David for a
memorial, when the Philistines caught him in Gath
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me: he is daily
fighting, and troubling me.
Mine enemies are daily in hand to swallow me up: for they be many that fight
against me, O thou most Highest.
Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid: yet put I my trust in thee.
I will praise God, because of his word: I have put my trust in God, and will not
fear what flesh can do unto me.
They daily mistake my words: all that they imagine is to do me evil.
They hold all together, and keep themselves close: and mark my steps, when
they lay wait for my soul.
Shall they escape for their wickedness: thou, O God, in thy displeasure shalt cast
them down.
Thou tellest my flittings; put my tears into thy bottle: are not these things noted
in thy book?
Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight: this I
know; for God is on my side.
In God's word I will rejoice: in the Lord's word will I comfort me.
Yea, in God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows: unto thee will I give thanks.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling: that I may
walk before God in the light of the living.
<h3>Psalm 56</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David, for a memorial. When he fled from the presence of Saul to
the cave
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, be merciful unto me, for my soul trusteth in
thee: and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until this
tyranny be over-past.
I will call unto the most high God: even unto the God that shall perform the
cause which I have in hand.
He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him that would eat
me up.
God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among lions.
And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are
spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they have digged a
pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, and give praise.
Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee
among the nations.
For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens: and thy truth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 57</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation: and do ye judge the
thing that is right, O ye sons of men?
Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth: and your hands deal with
wickedness.
The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb: as soon as they are
born, they go astray, and speak lies.
They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent: even like the deaf adder that
stoppeth her ears.
Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer: charm he never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; smite the jaw-bones of the lions, O
Lord: let them fall away like water that runneth apace; and when they
shoot their arrows let them be rooted out.
Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of a woman:
and let them not see the sun.
Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns: so let indignation vex him, even as a
thing that is raw.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his
footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: doubtless
there is a God that judgeth the earth.

<h3>Psalm 58</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David for a memorial, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill
him
DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God: defend me from them that rise up
against me.
O deliver me from the wicked doers: and save me from the blood-thirsty men.
For lo, they lie waiting for my soul: the mighty men are gathered against me,
without any offence or fault of me, O Lord.
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: arise thou therefore to help
me, and behold.
Stand up, O Lord God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the heathen: and be
not merciful unto them that offend of malicious wickedness.
They go to and fro in the evening: they grin like a dog, and run about through the
city.
Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips: for who doth
hear?
But thou. O Lord, shalt have them in derision: and thou shalt laugh all the
heathen to scorn.
My strength will I ascribe unto thee: for thou art the God of my refuge.
God sheweth me his goodness plenteously: and God shall let me see my desire
upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget it: but scatter them abroad among the
people, and put them down, O Lord, our defence.
For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be taken in
their pride: and why? their preaching is of cursing and lies.
Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish: and know that
it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.
And in the evening they will return: grin like a dog, and will go about the city.
They will run here and there for meat: and grudge if they be not satisfied.
As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betimes in the
morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
trouble.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my
merciful God.
<h3>Psalm 59</h3>
For the end. For them that shall yet be changed. For an inscription by David for instruction.
When he had burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syrian Sobal, and Joab had returned and smitten
twelve thousand in the Valley of Salt
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad: thou hast also been
displeased; O turn thee unto us again.
Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: heal the sores thereof, for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewed thy people heavy things: thou hast given us a drink of deadly
wine.
Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee: that they may triumph because of
the truth.
Therefore were thy beloved delivered: help me with thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Sichem: and mete out
the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head;
Judah is my law-giver.
Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, be thou glad
of me.
Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou cast us out, O God: wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
O be thou our help in trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Through God will we do great acts: for it is he that shall tread down our enemies.
<h3>Psalm 60</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of David
HEAR my crying, O God: give ear unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth will I call unto thee: when my heart is in heaviness.
O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I: for thou hast been my hope, and
a strong tower for me against the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: and my trust shall be under the covering of
thy wings.
For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires: and hast given an heritage unto those
that fear thy Name.
Thou shalt grant the King a long life: that his years may endure throughout all
generations.
He shall dwell before God for ever: O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness,
that they may preserve him.
So will I always sing praise unto thy Name: that I may daily perform my vows.

<h3>Psalm 61</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David for Idithun
MY SOUL truly waiteth still upon God: for of him cometh my salvation.
He verily is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
greatly fall.
How long will ye imagine mischief against every man: ye shall be slain all the
sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and like a broken hedge.
Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt: their delight is in
lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse with their heart.
Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God: for my hope is in him.
He truly is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
fall.
In God is my health, and my glory: the rock of my might, and in God is my trust.
O put your trust in him alway, ye people: pour out your hearts before him, for
God is our hope.
As for the children of men, they are but vanity: the children of men are deceitful
upon the weights, they are altogether lighter than vanity itself.
O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselves unto vanity: if riches
increase, set not your heart upon them.
God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same: that power belongeth
unto God;
And that thou, Lord, art merciful: for thou rewardest every man according to his
work.
<h3>Psalm 62</h3>
A psalm of David. When he was in the wilderness of Idumea
O GOD, thou art my God: early will I seek thee.
My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee: in a barren and dry
land where no water is.
Thus have I looked for thee in holiness: that I might behold thy power and glory.
For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: my lips shall praise thee.
As long as I live will I magnify thee on this manner: and lift up my hands in thy
Name.
My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness: when my
mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.
Have I not remembered thee in my bed: and thought upon thee when I was
waking?
Because thou hast been my helper: therefore under the shadow of thy wings will
I rejoice.
My soul hangeth upon thee: thy right hand hath upholden me.
These also that seek the hurt of my soul: they shall go under the earth.
Let them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be a portion for foxes.
But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him shall be
commended: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
<h3>Psalm 63</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the gathering together of the froward: and from the insurrection of
wicked doers;
Who have whet their tongue like a sword: and shoot out their arrows, even bitter
words;
That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: suddenly do they hit him, and
fear not.
They encourage themselves in mischief: and commune among themselves how
they may lay snares, and say that no man shall see them.
They imagine wickedness, and practise it: that they keep secret among
themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.
But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow: that they shall be
wounded.
Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall insomuch that whoso seeth them
shall laugh them to scorn.
And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done: for they shall perceive that
it is his work.
The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and put his trust in him: and all they that
are true of heart shall be glad.

I ever commit sins, and have no fear of Thee, O Christ, Who seekest my repentance with longsuffering. Grant me the intention to convert, and disdain me not, in that Thou art good. Wretch that I am, I never cease to heap up sins upon sins, O Christ, O only Good and Sinless One. Take pity and save me. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Boldly did the valiant spiritual athletes call to each other: This contest is full of struggles. Let us run, for Christ, the Judge of the contest standeth before us, crowning those who vanquish the enemy. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye put off the body through many and varied wounds, and clothed yourselves in the vesture of incorruption, O wise martyrs; and ye became children of the Father of compassions. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Virgin Birthgiver of God, heal thou my soul, which hath been afflicted by many sins, that with cries of thanksgiving I may ever earnestly glorify thee </p><p><i class="note">Another canon, of the honorable & great prophet John the Forerunner, the composition of Joseph, in Tone VI:</i> </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> At thy command O Lord, * the nature of the waters that beforehand flowed freely was transformed * and became like the earth; * whereby Israel having traversed them dryshod * chanted unto Thee a hymn of victory. The beauty of the Church, thou wast shown to be adorned, O blessed Forerunner. By thy prayers ever save it mighty and unshaken from every tempest of the heretics. Thou didst offer thyself to the Creator as a sacred, unblemished sacrifice, O divine Forerunner, and wast slaughtered like an innocent lamb. Wherefore, I pray thee with faith: Deliver me from all the malice of the enemy. Heal thou the diseases of our souls and bodies, O ever-glorious Forerunner, ever beseeching the Word, Who in His tender compassion hath taken away all infirmities and sicknesses. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O all-holy one, thou hast given birth to the unapproachable Word Who shareth flesh with us hypostatically.

I submit to the desires of my flesh, unconscionably ignoring Thy wishes, O Christ; and I fear the fiery retribution, O Word, do Thou deliver me from such. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> While suffering bodily pangs, the spiritual athletes looked forward to a life of ease without pain; and having joyously received it, they ever ease the pains of the faithful. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With the rays of your struggles ye dispersed the cruel night of delusion, O passion-bearers, and have passed over to the unwaning Light, ever removing the darkness of our pangs. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The prophet foresaw thee as the portal of God, through which He alone passed, as is known, O most pure Virgin.

With lightning-flashes of solar radiance dost thou illumine all creation; for thou wast shown to be a brilliant star of the noetic Sun, O Forerunner. Him do thou earnestly entreat, that He drive the darkness of the passions away from our pained hearts. Standing between the law and grace, O divine Forerunner, manifestly showing the cessation of the one and the pure dawning of the other unto all: the perfect restoration of those who have waxed old through sins. Baptist of Christ, we cry aloud: Deliver us from, the attacks of the demons, the temptations of life and all tribulation, entreating the Supremely good One, that on the day of judgment we may be freed from torments. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O blessed and pure Lady, who hast ineffably given birth unto God: With His divine Baptist unceasingly pray for us who fall into the perils of life and are beset by sins. </p><h3>Ode IV</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Assured of Thy coming in the flesh, O Christ, * the Prophet Habakkuk cried aloud: * Glory to Thy power O Lord.

Send down upon me streams of tears, O Master, Word of God, that I may wash away the mire of my many offenses. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Led like lambs to the slaughter, O martyrs, ye were deemed worthy of glory and slew the warlike enemy. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Thy streams of your blood which was shed prepared all to receive torrents of delight, O all-praised and divine martyrs. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The Lord became incarnate from thy pure blood, granting repentance to all mankind through thy mediation, O Maiden. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Having never left the bosom of the Father, * Thou didst descend to earth O Christ God, * I have heard of the mystery of Thy dispensation, * and I have glorified Thee, * O only Lover of mankind. Having cast down the horde of the adversary and prevailed over them with brilliance, O Baptist, By thy prayers cast down sin which reigneth in me, I pray thee. Revealed unto us to be a noetic lampstand, O blessed one, thou didst point out Jesus, the great Sun of righteousness. Pray thou that the hearts of all may be illumined by Him. Conceived and born in iniquities, I live in slothfulness, and fear the torments to come. Praying to God, rescue me from them, O Baptist.  Bring to God supplications for us who honor thee, O Baptist, that He may deliver us from every grievous circumstance and from the harm wrought by the demons, we pray, </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> In many images, the shadows of the law revealed thee who hast given birth unto God.

When Thou shalt judge the earth, O Word, deliver me from Thy righteous wrath, and show me to be a temple of Thy goodness, cleansed of my many offenses through repentance, O only Creator of all. I have become blinded in mind by the evil gloom of the passions, and my heart hath become senseless, and I know not what I do. Turn me back to Thee, O Christ, and grant me the repentance which purifies from sin. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having like youths run the race full of sweat, O spiritual athletes, ye attained unto splendor in heaven, receiving the honors of victory from the hand of the Bestower of life; wherefore, ye now rejoice. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With the mighty sinews of your sacred pangs ye truly choked the serpent, the author of evil, O spiritual athletes, and have been deemed worthy of the delight of paradise. Wherefore, we praise you. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O thou who art the radiant cloud of the Sun, shine upon me the noetic light of true repentance, and dispel the darkness of wicked thoughts, that with faith I may hymn thee as the salvation of the faithful. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Having risen at dawn out of the night, * I entreat Thee O Lord my God: * grant me the forgiveness of my sins, * and guide my steps to the light * of thy commandments, I pray Thee.  The voice of one crying in the wilderness, O most wise one, thou didst cause thoughts of the acknowledgment of the God to spring forth; wherefore, I pray thee: Restore my soul which hath become a desert through all manner of transgressions. Thou wast shown to be the pure vessel of the Master, O divine prophet. By thy prayers deliver me from impure acts, and entreat the Benefactor, that I may receive everlasting honors. Iniquities have entered into me through the door of slothfulness. O blessed Forerunner, make me better through examples of repentance, that I may diligently tread the paths of the Lord. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Mortify the earthly understanding of my flesh, O Theotokos who hast given birth unto Life, Who by death hath utterly destroyed death in His divine power, O pure and most holy one. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Having fallen into the abyss of sin, O Good One, * like Jonah from the midst of the whale I cry unto Thee: * Lead my life up from corruption, * and save me, O Lover of mankind. I have been revealed to be a new prodigal, having lived vilely on earth, and capitulated before the assault of the passions; but turn me back, O Christ my God, and save me, in that Thou lovest mankind. Groan, O my soul, that thou mayest be delivered from groaning; shed tears, that in the next world thou mayest not taste of ceaseless tears and pain, which will be of no benefit. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye were revealed to be like stones manifestly set in the crown of the Church of Christ, and became its magnificent adornment, O honored great-martyrs. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having received worthy ends in God, O most wise ones, ye have inherited never-ending rewards.

Manifestly aglow with rays of the virtues, and shining with splendid martyrdom, thou dost illumine all creation, O close friend of the noetic Dayspring. Thou didst spring forth from a barren and elderly woman, O blessed one; wherefore, I cry out to thee: With the beauty of repentance and thy supplications renew me who have grown old through many sins. O divine prophet, lampstand of the never-waning Light, by thy prayers light the lamp of my heart, and cause me to share in the divine Light. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The Word descended into thy womb like rain.

I have fallen into the passion of dishonor, O Savior, and have made myself like unto the beasts. And, darkened, I no longer see Thee waiting with great patience, O Word. Grant me time for repentance, and save me. I have reached the end of my life in slothfulness, doing what I ought not to do; and lo! Unaware I now approach the gates of Hades. Disdain me not, O Christ Who alone art good. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O most wise ones, ye died, desiring everlasting life for the world; and having utterly slain the enemy, ye took wing to the heavens, ever praying for us, O spiritual athletes. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Released from the demands of the body, O martyrs, ye broke asunder the bonds of delusion, and with mighty love bound men’s souls to Christ Who was bound by the flesh, and loosed us from the curse. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The prophet foresaw thee as a new scroll whereon the Word of the Father was written; wherefore, I beseech thee, O pure one: Pray that I may be entered in the book of the living, erasing the record of my many evils. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Of old the Children were shown to be * bedewed in the fiery furnace, * chanting and praising the one God saying: * 'Supremely exalted and exceedingly glorified is the God of our Fathers'. By thy prayers grant me showers of tears, O Forerunner who immersed the Abyss of tender compassion in the river’s streams, and wholly cleanse me of defilement of flesh and spirit. Offer prayer to our God, Who is over all, that, in that He is full of loving-kindness, He have mercy upon me who have sinned and cannot recover. O barren soul, hasten thou to repent, lest the righteous judgment cut thee down at the root like the barren fig-tree; but cry unto the Master; O God, having cleansed me, save me! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Possessed of a soul slain by evil crimes, I pray thee, O Lady who slew Hades by thy birthgiving: Enliven me with models of repentance. </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Him Who is unceasingly glorified * by the angels in the highest, * O Ye heavens of heavens, earth and ye mountains, * ye hills and depths of the sea, * and all ye races of mankind, * bless ye with hymns as the Fashioner, * Redeemer, and God! Enjoying harmful pleasures in overabundance, I, the senseless one, have madly surpassed every other sinner. As Thou hast an infinite abundance of tender compassion, grant me cleansing of my transgressions. The Bridegroom is at the door! Light thy lamp, O my soul, filling it with the oil of loving-kindness and every good work. Before the door is closed, make haste to enter with Christ in ineffable joy. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Undaunted by tortures, the valiant spiritual athletes cried out: “Behold, now is the acceptable time! Let us all stand with steadfast mind, and with a little pain, let us acquire the life which is devoid of pain, and the sweetness which groweth not old!” </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ever irrigated with divine waters, O passion-bearers of the Savior, ye water the whole earth with the emulation of your struggles, forever rendering it fruitful in the virtues, for Christ. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Theotokos, renowned intercession and hope of Christians: On the dread day intercede for me, who have greatly transgressed, and deliver me from terrible Gehenna, numbering me among the sheep at the right hand of thy Son. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The King of glory, who is alone without beginning, * Before Whom all the powers of heaven stand in awe * and the hosts of angels tremble: * O ye priests praise, and ye people * supremely exalt Him throughout the ages. Cease thou never to entreat the only Redeemer, Who gave release to those who were bound and ever glorify thee, O prophet, that I, who have been bound, may be released from my many transgressions I have been wounded by the sword of pleasures, and cry out to thee in pain of heart: Heal thou the pangs of my soul, entreating Christ, the only Physician of souls and bodies. O Forerunner who baptized the Word with thine own hand, cease not to unceasingly entreat Him, that from the hand of sin He may deliver me who have sinned greatly and am brought low and condemned. Because I have foolishly buried in the earth the talant entrusted to me by God, I await bitter retribution. Rescue me from such by thy prayers, O Baptist, I beseech thee with faith. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thou didst remain unconsumed when thou didst take the unbearable Fire into thy womb, O Virgin. Wherefore, rescue me from the unquenchable fire, bedewing me now with most beauteous examples of true repentance. We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the </p><p><i class="note">refrain:</i> “More honorable than the cherubim ...”<i class="note"> Prostrations.</i> </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Who from among mankind is able to describe * the seedless conception of thy birthgiving? * Who from among mortals will not marvel * at the birth of thine incorrupt Offspring? * Wherefore, we, the tribes of earth, * magnify thee, O Theotokos. That we may inherit the good things to come, let us weep, let us sigh, let us entreat Christ, O ye faithful, while we have time for repentance and prayer. Like the Canaanite woman I cry to Thee: Have mercy on me, O Christ, as of old Thou didst set aright the prostrate woman, O Jesus, and save me who am drowning in sins, as Thou didst Peter O Savior. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Afflicted by tribulations, imprisonment and torments, O martyred passion-bearers, ye passed over to the broad plain of consolation, and deliver us from oppression and transgressions. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> While the earth hath now covered your bodies, heaven holdeth your holy souls; and standing ever before the throne of glory, they rejoice with the angels. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The Lord Who clothed Himself in me issued forth from thee, O most pure one; wherefore, beseech Him to illumine me with a vesture of light, having now stripped from me the most grievous rags of the passions, O Virgin. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Conceiving without knowing corruption, * and lending thy flesh to the Word, * O Mother unwedded and Virgin Theotokos, * thou art the vessel of the Uncircumscribable One, * and dwelling place of thy Creator, * thee do we magnify. Thou didst spring forth from a sacred root, O prophet, wholly uprooting the roots of evil, whereby I am choked and have become useless. O blessed one, set me aright, that I may put forth the fruits of divine repentance. The Church knoweth thee to be a most comely swallow and nightingale, O great Forerunner; for thou didst sing the hymn of repentance to souls laid waste and grown hard through evils. Wherefore, we bless thee with faith. Unto all thou didst show the ways leading to the gates of salvation, O glorious Forerunner. Strengthen me to walk them, for I am drawn into all the trackless wastes of life and, beguiled, have committed evil. The awesome day is nigh at hand, and bearing deeds worthy of condemnation, I lament: Lord, O Lord, Who alone art merciful: through the prayers of Thy Fore-runner and all the saints, show me then to be uncondemned. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O thou who art full of grace, who hast given birth to the divine Light, illumine my soul, which hath been darkened by transgression, I pray, and show me to be free of everlasting darkness, that I may magnify and glorify thee, the ever-blessed one.

<h3>Psalm 64</h3>
For the end. A psalm and song of David
THOU, O God, art praised in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed in
Jerusalem.
Thou that hearest the prayer: unto thee shall all flesh come.
My misdeeds prevail against me: O be thou merciful unto our sins.
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: he shall dwell
in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house, even of
thy holy temple.
Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation: thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that remain in the broad sea.
Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains: and is girded about with power.
Who stilleth the raging of the sea: and the noise of his waves, and the madness of
the people.
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afraid at thy
tokens: thou that makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
praise thee.
Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very plenteous.
The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest
for the earth.
Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof: thou
makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop fatness.
They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and the little hills shall
rejoice on every side.
The folds shall be full of sheep: the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn,
that they shall laugh and sing.
<h3>Psalm 65</h3>
For the end. A song of a plasm of resurrection
O BE joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of his Name, make
his praise to be glorious.
Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the greatness of
thy power shall thine enemies be found liars unto thee.
For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy Name.
O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is in his doing
toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the water on foot;
there did we rejoice thereof.
He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people: and such as will
not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.
O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to slip.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our loins.
Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water, and
thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay thee my vows, which I
promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of rams: I will offer
bullocks and goats.
O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what he hath
done for my soul.
I called unto him with my mouth: and gave him praises with my tongue.
If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart: the Lord will not hear me.
But God hath heard me: and considered the voice of my prayer.
Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned his mercy from me.
<h3>Psalm 66</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns
GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his countenance,
and be merciful unto us:
That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the folk righteously,
and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God, shall
give us his blessing.
God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 67</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song of David
LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee
before him.
Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away: and like as wax
melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the presence of God.
But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them also be merry and
joyful .
O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name: magnify him that rideth upon
the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise him in his Name JAH, and
rejoice before him.
He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows: even God
in his holy habitation.
He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the
prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates continue in scarceness.
O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through
the wilderness;
The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God: even as Sinai
also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.
Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreshedst it
when it was weary.
Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness
prepared for the poor.
The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers.
Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited: and they of the household
divided the spoil.
Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove: that
is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.
When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake: then were they as white as
snow in Salmon.
As the hill of Basan, so is God's hill: even an high hill, as the hill of Basan.
Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which it pleaseth him to
dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: and the Lord
is among them, as in the holy place of Sinai.
Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for
men: yea, even for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among
them.
Praised be the Lord daily: even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his benefits
upon us.
He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is the Lord, by
whom we escape death.
God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalp of such a one as
goeth on still in his wickedness.
The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan: mine own
will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the tongue of
thy dogs may be red through the same.
It is well seen, O God, how thou goest: how thou, my God and King, goest in the
sanctuary.
The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the damsels
playing with the timbrels.
Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations: from the ground
of the heart.
There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their counsel: the
princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.
Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing, O God, that thou
hast wrought in us,
For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem: so shall kings bring presents unto thee.
When the company of the spear-men, and multitude of the mighty are scattered
abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they humbly bring pieces of
silver: and when he hath scattered the people that delight in war;
Then shall the princes come out of Eqypt: the Morians' land shall soon stretch
our her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord;
Who sitteth in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he doth send out his
voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.
Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel: his worship and strength is in the
clouds.
O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: even the God of Israel, he will give
strength and power unto his people; blessed be God.

<h3>Psalm 68</h3>
For the end. A Psalm of David for alternate verses
SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.
I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is: I am come into deep waters, so
that the floods run over me.
I am weary of crying; my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for waiting so long
upon my God.
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that
are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.
I paid them the things that I never took: God, thou knowest my simpleness, and
my faults are not hid from thee.
Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my cause:
let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of
Israel.
And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof: shame hath covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an alien unto my mother's
children.
For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me: and the rebukes of them that
rebuked thee are fallen upon me.
I wept, and chastened myself with fasting: and that was turned to my reproof.
I put on sackcloth also: and they jested upon me.
They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs upon
me.
But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.
Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the truth of thy salvation.
Take me out of the mire, that I sink not: O let me be delivered from them that
hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up: and let
not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable: turn thee unto me
according to the multitude of thy mercies.
And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: O haste thee, and
hear me.
Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: O deliver me, because of mine enemies.
Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are
all in thy sight.
Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to
have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.
They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and let the things that
should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.
Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not: and ever bow thou down their backs.
Pour out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold
of them.
Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they talk how they may vex
them whom thou hast wounded.
Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and not come into thy
righteousness.
Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be written among the
righteous.
As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God, shall lift me up.
I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with thanksgiving.
This also shall please the Lord: better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God, and your soul
shall live.
For the Lord heareth the poor: and despiseth not his prisoners.
Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea, and all that moveth therein.
For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah: that men may dwell there,
and have it in possession.
The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his Name
shall dwell therein.
<h3>Psalm 69</h3>
For the end. By David for a remembrance; that the Lord may save me
HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned
backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.
Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame: that cry over me, There,
there.
But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let all such as
delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and in misery: haste thee unto me, O God.
Thou art my helper and my redeemer: O Lord, make no long tarrying.

<h3>Psalm 70</h3>
By David. A psalm sung by the sons of Jonadab and the first that were taken captive
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: but rid
me and deliver me in thy righteousness, incline thine ear unto me, and save
me.
Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may alway resort: thou hast promised to
help me, for thou art my house of defence and my castle.
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the hand of the
unrighteous and cruel man.
For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope, even from
my youth.
Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: thou art he that took
me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall be always of thee.
I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is in thee.
O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy glory and honour
all the day long.
Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength faileth
me.
For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul take their
counsel together, saying: God hath forsaken him; persecute him, and take
him, for there is none to deliver him.
Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me.
Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul: let them be covered
with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.
As for me, I will patiently abide alway: and will praise thee more and more.
My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation: for I know no end
thereof.
I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy
righteousness only.
Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I tell of
thy wondrous works.
Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed: until I have
shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that
are yet for to come.
Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are they that thou hast
done; O God, who is like unto thee?
O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me, and yet didst thou
turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth
again.
Thou hast brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every side.
Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an
instrument of musick: unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Holy One
of Israel.
My lips will be fain when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul whom thou hast
delivered.
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are
confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.
<h3>Psalm 71</h3>
For Solomon
GIVE the King thy judgements, O God: and thy righteousness unto the King's
son.
Then shall he judge thy people according unto right: and defend the poor.
The mountains also shall bring peace: and the little hills righteousness unto the
people.
He shall keep the simple folk by their right: defend the children of the poor, and
punish the wrong-doer.
They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth: from one generation
to another.
He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool: even as the drops that
water the earth.
In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea, and abundance of peace, so long as
the moon endureth.
His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other: and from the flood unto
the world's end.
They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him: his enemies shall lick
the dust.
The kings of Tharsis and of the isles shall give presents: the kings of Arabia and
Saba shall bring gifts.
All kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do him service.
For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth: the needy also, and him that hath
no helper.
He shall be favourable to the simple and needy: and shall preserve the souls of
the poor.
He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong: and dear shall their blood
be in his sight.
He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia: prayer shall be
made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.
There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills: his fruit shall
shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city like grass upon the earth.
His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the
posterities: which shall be blessed through him; and all the heathen shall
praise him.
Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel: which only doeth wondrous
things;
And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: and all the earth shall be filled
with his majesty. Amen, Amen.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 72</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
TRULY God is loving unto Israel: even unto such as are of a clean heart.
Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone: my treadings had well-nigh slipt.
And why? I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such
prosperity.
For they are in no peril of death: but are lusty and strong.
They come in no misfortune like other folk: neither are they plagued like other
men.
And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride: and overwhelmed with
cruelty.
Their eyes swell with fatness: and they do even what they lust.
They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy: their talking is against the
most High.
For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their tongue goeth
through the world.
Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no small advantage.
Tush, say they, how should God perceive it: is there knowledge in the most High?
Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in
possession: and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed
mine hands in innocency.
All the day long have I been punished: and chastened every morning.
Yea, and I had almost said even as they: but lo, then I should have condemned
the generation of thy children.
Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me,
Until I went into the sanctuary of God: then understood I the end of these men;
Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places: and castest them down, and
destroyest them.
O how suddenly do they consume: perish, and come to a fearful end!
Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh: so shalt thou make their image to
vanish out of the city.
Thus my heart was grieved: and it went even through my reins.
So foolish was I, and ignorant: even as it were a beast before thee.
Nevertheless, I am alway by thee: for thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel: and after that receive me with glory.
Whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth that I desire in
comparison of thee.
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my
portion for ever.
For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that
commit fornication against thee.
But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord God: and
to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
<h3>Psalm 73</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot
against the sheep of thy pasture?
O think upon thy congregation: whom thou hast purchased and redeemed of old.
Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance: and mount Sion, wherein thou hast
dwelt.
Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy: which hath done
evil in thy sanctuary.
Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations: and set up their
banners for tokens.
He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees: was known to bring it to an
excellent work.
But now they break down all the carved work thereof: with axes and hammers.
They have set fire upon thy holy places: and have defiled the dwelling-place of
thy Name, even unto the ground.
Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether: thus have
they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.
We see not our tokens, there is not one prophet more: no, not one is there among
us, that understandeth any more.
O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour: how long shall the enemy
blaspheme thy Name, for ever?
Why withdrawest thou thy hand: why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy
bosom to consume the enemy?
For God is my King of old: the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself.
Thou didst divide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the
dragons in the waters.
Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces: and gavest him to be meat for the
people in the wilderness.
Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks: thou driedst up
mighty waters.
The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked: and how the foolish
people hath blasphemed thy Name.
O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the enemies: and
forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.
Look upon the covenant: for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel
habitations.
O let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the poor and needy give praise
unto thy Name.
Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
blasphemeth thee daily.
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the presumption of them that hate thee
increaseth ever more and more.

<h3>Psalm 74</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: A psalm of a song for Asaph
UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks: yea, unto thee do we give thanks.
Thy Name also is so nigh: and that do thy wondrous works declare.
When I receive the congregation: I shall judge according unto right.
The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the pillars of it.
I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly: and to the ungodly, Set not up your horn.
Set not up your horn on high: and speak not with a stiff neck.
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west: nor yet from the
south.
And why? God is the Judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixed,
and he poureth out of the same.
As for the dregs thereof: all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and suck
them out.
But I will talk of the God of Jacob: and praise him for ever.
All the horns of the ungodly also will I break: and the horns of the righteous shall
be exalted.
<h3>Psalm 75</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns, a psalm for Asaph: A song for the Assyrian
IN JEWRY is God known: his Name is great in Israel.
At Salem is his tabernacle: and his dwelling in Sion.
There brake he the arrows of the bow: the shield, the sword, and the battle.
Thou art of more honour and might: than the hills of the robbers.
The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep: and all the men whose hands
were mighty have found nothing.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob: both the chariot and horse are fallen.
Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when thou art
angry?
Thou didst cause thy judgement to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled,
and was still;
When God arose to judgement: and to help all the meek upon earth.
The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise: and the fierceness of them shalt
thou refrain.
Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that are round about him:
bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
He shall refrain the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among the kings of the
earth.
<h3>Psalm 76</h3>
For the end. For Idithun, a psalm of Asaph
I WILL cry unto God with my voice: even unto God will I cry with my voice, and
he shall hearken unto me.
In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran and ceased not in the
night-season ; my soul refused comfort.
When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God: when my heart is vexed, I will
complain.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble, that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old: and the years that are past.
I call to remembrance my song: and in the night I commune with mine own
heart, and search out my spirits.
Will the Lord absent himself for ever: and will he be no more intreated?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly to an end for
evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his loving-kindness in
displeasure?
And I said, It is mine own infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right
hand of the most Highest.
I will remember the works of the Lord: and call to mind thy wonders of old time.
I will think also of all thy works: and my talking shall be of thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is holy: who is so great a God as our God?
Thou art the God that doeth wonders: and hast declared thy power among the
people.
Thou hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid: the depths
also were troubled.
The clouds poured out water, the air thundered: and thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: the lightnings shone upon the
ground: the earth was moved, and shook withal.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and thy footsteps are
not known.
Thou leddest thy people like sheep: by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<h3>Psalm 77</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
HEAR my law, O my people: incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hard sentences of old;
Which we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told us;
That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to come: but
to shew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he
hath done.
He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law: which he commanded our
forefathers to teach their children;
That their posterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn;
To the intent that when they came up: they might shew their children the same;
That they might put their trust in God: and not to forget the works of God, but to
keep his commandments;
And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation: a
generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not
stedfastly unto God;
Like as the children of Ephraim: who being harnessed, and carrying bows,
turned themselves back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his law;
But forgat what he had done: and the wonderful works that he had shewed for
them.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt:
even in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea, and let them go through: he made the waters to stand on an
heap.
In the day-time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night through with a
light of fire.
He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness: and gave them drink thereof, as it had
been out of the great depth.
He brought waters out of the stony rock: so that it gushed out like the rivers.
Yet for all this they sinned more against him: and provoked the most Highest in
the wilderness.
They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their lust.
They spake against God also, saying: Shall God prepare a table in the
wilderness?
He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
flowed withal: but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?
When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and
there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;
Because they believed not in God: and put not their trust in his help.
So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.
He rained down manna also upon them for to eat: and gave them food from
heaven.
So man did eat angels' food: for he sent them meat enough.
He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven: and through his power he
brought in the south-west-wind.
He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand
of the sea.
He let it fall among their tents: even round about their habitation.
So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire: they were
not disappointed of their lust.
But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon
them, and slew the wealthiest of them: yea, and smote down the chosen
men that were in Israel.
But for all this they sinned yet more: and believed not his wondrous works.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years in trouble.
When he slew them, they sought him: and turned them early, and inquired after
God.
And they remembered that God was their strength: and that the high God was
their redeemer.
Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and dissembled with him
in their tongue.
For their heart was not whole with him: neither continued they stedfast in his
covenant.
But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds: and destroyed them not.
Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not suffer his whole
displeasure to arise.
For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were even a wind that
passeth away, and cometh not again.
Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness: and grieved him in the
desert.
They turned back, and tempted God: and moved the Holy One in Israel.
They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered them from the
hand of the enemy;
How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
He turned their waters into blood: so that they might not drink of the rivers.
He sent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to destroy them.
He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar: and their labour unto the grasshopper.
He destroyed their vines with hail-stones: and their mulberry-trees with the frost.
He smote their cattle also with hail-stones: and their flocks with hot
thunderbolts.
He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure and trouble:
and sent evil angels among them.
He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death: but gave
their life over to the pestilence;
And smote all the first-born in Egypt: the most principal and mightiest in the
dwellings of Ham.
But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep: and carried them in the
wilderness like a flock.
He brought them out safely, that they should not fear: and overwhelmed their
enemies with the sea.
And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary: even to his mountain
which he purchased with his right hand.
He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land to be divided among
them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not his testimonies;
But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers: starting aside like a
broken bow.
For they grieved him with their hill-altars: and provoked him to displeasure with
their images.
When God heard this, he was wroth: and took sore displeasure at Israel.
So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that he had pitched
among men.
He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with his inheritance.
The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not given to
marriage.
Their priests were slain with the sword: and there were no widows to make
lamentation.
So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep: and like a giant refreshed with wine.
He smote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a perpetual shame.
He refused the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
But chose the tribe of Judah: even the hill of Sion which he loved.
And there he built his temple on high: and laid the foundation of it like the
ground which he hath made continually.
He chose David also his servant: and took him away from the sheep-folds.
As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him: that he might
feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
So he fed them with a faithful and true heart: and ruled them prudently with all
his power.

<h3>Psalm 78</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they
defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the
air: and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.
Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem: and there was
no man to bury them.
We are become an open shame to our enemies: a very scorn and derision unto
them that are round about us.
Lord, how long wilt thou be angry: shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?
Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee: and upon
the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.
For they have devoured Jacob: and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon: for we are
come to great misery.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: O deliver us, and be
merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake.
Wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?
O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed: be openly shewed upon
the heathen in our sight.
O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to the
greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die.
And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee: reward
thou them , O Lord, seven-fold into their bosom.
So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for
ever: and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to
generation.
<h3>Psalm 79</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses. A testimony for Asaph: a Psalm concerning the Assyrian
HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep: shew
thyself also, thou that sittest upon the cherubims.
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses: stir up thy strength, and come, and
help us.
Turn us again, O God: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
O Lord God of hosts: how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears: and givest them plenteousness of
tears to drink.
Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh us
to scorn.
Turn us again, thou God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall
be whole.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and
planted it.
Thou madest room for it: and when it had taken root it filled the land.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it: and the boughs thereof were like
the goodly cedar-trees.
She stretched out her branches unto the sea: and her boughs unto the river.
Why hast thou then broken down her hedge: that all they that go by pluck off her
grapes?
The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up: and the wild beasts of the field
devour it.
Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven: behold, and visit this
vine;
And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted: and the branch
that thou madest so strong for thyself.
It is burnt with fire, and cut down: and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy
countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man, whom
thou madest so strong for thine own self.
And so will not we go back from thee: O let us live, and we shall call upon thy
Name.
Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.
<h3>Psalm 80</h3>
For the end. A psalm for Asaph, concerning the winepresses
SING we merrily unto God our strength: make a cheerful noise unto the God of
Jacob.
Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret: the merry harp with the lute.
Blow up the trumpet in the new-moon: even in the time appointed, and upon our
solemn feast-day.
For this was made a statute for Israel: and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony: when he came out of the land of
Egypt, and had heard a strange language.
I eased his shoulder from the burden: and his hands were delivered from making
the pots.
Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee: and heard thee what
time as the storm fell upon thee.
I proved thee also: at the waters of strife.
Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel: if thou wilt hearken unto me,
There shall no strange god be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any other god.
I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy
mouth wide, and I shall fill it.
But my people would not hear my voice: and Israel would not obey me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts: and let them follow their own
imaginations.
O that my people would have hearkened unto me: for if Israel had walked in my
ways,
I should soon have put down their enemies: and turned my hand against their
adversaries.
The haters of the Lord should have been found liars: but their time should have
endured for ever.
He should have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour: and with honey out of
the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

<h3>Psalm 81</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
GOD standeth in the congregation of princes: he is a Judge among gods.
How long will ye give wrong judgement: and accept the persons of the ungodly?
Defend the poor and fatherless: see that such as are in need and necessity have
right.
Deliver the outcast and poor: save them from the hand of the ungodly.
They will not be learned nor understand, but walk on still in darkness: all the
foundations of the earth are out of course.
I have said, Ye are gods: and ye are all the children of the most Highest.
But ye shall die like men: and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth: for thou shalt take all heathen to thine
inheritance.
<h3>Psalm 82</h3>
A song of a psalm for Asaph
HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: refrain not thyself, O God.
For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring: and they that hate thee have lift up
their head.
They have imagined craftily against thy people: and taken counsel against thy
secret ones.
They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people:
and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
For they have cast their heads together with one consent: and are confederate
against thee;
The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismaelites: the Moabites and
Hagarenes;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek: the Philistines, with them that dwell at Tyre.
Assur also is joined with them: and have holpen the children of Lot.
But do thou to them as unto the Madianites: unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the
brook of Kison;
Who perished at Endor: and became as the dung of the earth.
Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeb: yea, make all their princes like
as Zeba and Salmana;
Who say, Let us take to ourselves: the houses of God in possession.
O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and as the stubble before the wind;
Like as the fire that burneth up the wood: and as the flame that consumeth the
mountains.
Persecute them even so with thy tempest: and make them afraid with thy storm.
Make their faces ashamed, O Lord: that they may seek thy Name.
Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more: let them be put to
shame, and perish.
And they shall know that thou, whose Name is Jehovah: art only the most Highest
over all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 83</h3>
For the end. A song for the sons of Core, concerning the winepresses
O HOW amiable are thy dwellings: thou Lord of hosts!
My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the Lord: my heart
and my flesh rejoice in the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest where she may
lay her young: even thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be alway praising thee.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are thy ways.
Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well: and the pools are filled
with water.
They will go from strength to strength: and unto the God of gods appeareth every
one of them in Sion.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer :hearken, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our defender: and look upon the face of thine Anointed.
For one day in thy courts: is better than a thousand.
I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God: than to dwell in the tents
of ungodliness.
For the Lord God is a light and defence: the Lord will give grace and worship,
and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a godly life.
O Lord God of hosts: blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 84</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou hast turned away the
captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people: and covered all their sins.
Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure: and turned thyself from thy wrathful
indignation.
Turn us then, O God our Saviour: and let thine anger cease from us.
Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever: and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from
one generation to another?
Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Shew us thy mercy, O Lord: and grant us thy salvation.
I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak
peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again.
For his salvation is nigh them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each
other.
Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness hath looked down from
heaven.
Yea, the Lord shall shew loving-kindness: and our land shall give her increase.
Righteousness shall go before him: and he shall direct his going in the way.

Having given birth to the Sun of righteousness for the world, O all-immaculate Maiden, drive the darkness away from those who hymn thee with faith in this thy splendid and holy temple. </p><h3>Ode III</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Lord and Savior, * Who in the beginning established the heavens * by Thine all-powerful Word , * and by the divine and all-accomplishing Spirit * hath granted them all their strength, * do Thou establish me on the unshakeable rock of Thy confession. O Jesus, Who stretched out the heaven as it were a curtain, Thou didst stretch out Thy hands upon the Tree, healing the intemperance of Adam, in that Thou art merciful, snatching all from the hands of the lying enemy. With thorns the iniquitous men crowned Thee, O Christ our King, Who hast crowned men with glory, uprooted the thorns of Adam’s disobedience, and planted the plant of understanding for all. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Mortal in essence, therein ye deigned to teach immortality, O most wise ones; wherefore, wounds and tribulations, persecutions and beatings, and the severing of your members, did ye all endure, rejoicing, O martyrs. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With steadfast intent ye brought low the lying enemy who boasted that he will destroy all things, O ye spiritual athletes who humbled yourselves for Christ; and having arrayed yourselves against him, ye were exalted with divine might. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Mother and ewe-lamb, beholding the Lamb Who is slaughtered of His own will going to His Passion, thou sheddest fountains of tears, saying: “What is this sacred thing, O my Child? How dost Thou die, intending to bring life to those who have died?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. In this thy divine temple, wherein thou hast shown forth a well-spring of miracles, O pure one, grant the salvific petitions of thy servants; and deliver them from torment, ever pouring forth thy divine visitation. Having given birth to Christ, the Abyss of mercies and Bestower of all good things, in a manner transcending cause and all telling, O pure one, thou hast truly shown this thy divine temple to be the cleansing of all the passions, through thy divine overshadowing. Blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, O Virgin Theotokos, joy of all; for thou hast truly given birth to the joy and gladness of the whole world, Him Who is the Lover of mankind, driving away sinful grief, O Bride of God. O Virgin, thou noetic coffer, who hast truly given birth to the incorrupt Manna: Come among us at this hour; and of all defilement rid us who in a pure manner call thee blessed. </p><h3>Ode IV</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Having never left the bosom of the Father, * Thou didst descend to earth O Christ God, * I have heard of the mystery of Thy dispensation, * and I have glorified Thee, * O only Lover of mankind. Having appeared on earth as a man, Thou didst make mankind heavenly; and suspended upon the Tree, O Master, Thou didst exalt with Thyself all who hymn Thy sufferings. For mortals Thou didst die, O Life, and for the unjust Thou didst endure violent suffering, O my righteous Jesus. We hymn Thine infinite tender compassion, O Long-suffering One. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The onslaught of wild beasts, the raging of the fire, the severing of hands and feet, the mutilation of your members, and all other tortures which win divine delight, did ye endure, O martyrs. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Crying out to Christ, the God of all, from the extremities of your bodies, O spiritual athletes, ye were heard, and have now been set high upon the rock of divine perfection. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Make entreaty for us to Him Who became incarnate from thee, O Theotokos, that we who glorify His sufferings may find help in time of peril. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. Of old, Habbakuk proclaimed thee the mountain overshadowed by the virtues, protecting all from the burning of the malice of our ancient foe, O most pure Lady Theotokos. Offer supplication unto the Lord Who became incarnate from thy most pure blood, O Lady, that He save from all harm thy people, who bless thee as is meet. This thy temple, full of the grace of God, hath become a source of healing for our souls and bodies, O most glorious one; for it causeth every disease to cease and washeth away the passions of those who with faith call thee blessed. By thy fervent and honorable visitation, O Virgin Lady, save all who with love flee to thine aid, and visit and grant their petitions which lead unto life. </p><h3>Ode V</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Having risen at dawn out of the night, * I entreat Thee O Lord my God: * grant me the forgiveness of my sins, * and guide my steps to the light * of thy commandments, I pray Thee.  Accepting crucifixion for the removal of evils, O Word of God, Thou didst taste gall, abolishing the bitter harm wrought by the pleasing fruit. Glory to Thy great loving-kindness! By Thy suspension upon the Cross, Thou didst cause the whole earth to quake by Thy divine might and healed the abasement thereof, O Master; thereby making wavering hearts steadfast in the knowledge of Thee. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Belial everywhere spread his evil nets, yet he did not ensnare the martyrs of Christ; for, receiving wings of fire, they reached the divine mansions. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Deified by God with the hand of His abundance, O passion-bearers, ye were in nowise daunted by painful tortures, since for you it was as though others were suffering; and ye remained thus, O most wise ones. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> When Thou wast hanging upon the Cross, the pure Virgin, wracked with lamentation, cried out: “With what eyes shall I look upon the burning Eye Who driest up all the depths, O my Son?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Night is bereft of light * for those without faith, O Christ, * but for the faithful there is enlightenment * in the sweetness of Thy words; * wherefore, I rise early unto Thee * and hymn Thy Divinity. Keeping vigil, we are weighed down by the sleep of sin, O pure one; yet in thy most honored temple take pity on us by thy vigilant divine supplication, O Bride of God. O pure one, grant a helping hand unto all of us who have recourse unto thee; wash away the defilement of all evil, and By thy prayers cleanse us of illness. O most pure Theotokos, who conceived God in thy virginal womb and hast given birth to Him: From all everlasting condemnation deliver those who hymn thee. The souls of those who come to thy temple with faith, having grown old through sins, are renewed, O most immaculate one, and they all glorify thee as is meet. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Sailing in the tempest of the cares of life, * together with the ship I have been submerged by sins, * and cast to the soul-corrupting beast, * wherefore like Jonah I cry to Thee, O Christ: * Lead me up from the deadly abyss. O only Redeemer, Thou didst pay Thy saving Blood as our price, redeeming us who were held captive, and bringing us to Thy Father, slaying the tyrant by the Cross, O supremely good Christ. Of old, through intemperance I suffered a grievous fall, but Christ, lifted up upon the Cross, His arms stretched out, exalted me, who had fallen, and manifestly healed all my wounds. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> In nowise sleeping the slumber of delusion, O martyrs, ye lulled to sleep every assault of the tormentors; and having fallen into the excellent sleep of the righteous, O blessed ones, ye became ever-watchful advocates for all. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Established firmly upon the rock of Christ’s divine precepts, O most glorious martyrs, ye remained unmoved by the wiles of the enemy; and with divine wisdom ye trampled him underfoot, divinely hastening to God. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Theotokos, thou hast given birth to a young Child, Who is known to exist timelessly with the Father, before all ages, and Who by His Cross hath renewed mankind, which had grown old through sins by the counsel of the author of evil. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Jonah cried out from the belly of Hades: * Lead my life up from corruption! * And we cry aloud unto Thee: * O almighty Savior, have mercy on us!  Thou alone hast poured forth the Water of salvation upon us, O only pure one, drying up the burning of delusions; and bedewing the true understanding of thy servants. O animate city of our God, free thy flock from godless barbarians, earthquake and want, and from every temptation. With the application of thy prayers cure the sores of our souls, O Theotokos, that we may hymn thee with divine voices. O Virgin Maiden, who by thy most pure birthgiving released Eve from pain: Release me from the pain of the passions of soul and body. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Of old the Children were shown to be * bedewed in the fiery furnace, * chanting and praising the one God saying: * 'Supremely exalted and exceedingly glorified is the God of our Fathers'. The life of our first parents, devoid of pain, did I find when thou wast suspended upon the Cross and willingly died, slaying the serpent, O greatly merciful Jesus Christ. We have all been delivered from the curse of the law; for the Bestower of the law was lifted up upon the Cross, pouring forth ever-flowing blessing, grace, mercy, and the abolition of corruption. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Approaching tortures with willing haste, the martyrs voluntarily emulated Him Who suffered; and, crowned by Him, they now join chorus with the angels. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Giving your bodies over to various torments, O most lauded martyrs, ye drowned the incorporeal foe in the streams of your blood, pouring forth fountains of healing. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “How can I not weep, beholding Thee upon the Cross, O my most sweet Child? How can I not lament Thee Who sufferest unjustly, O most righteous Judge?”, the Virgin Mother exclaimed. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. O all-hymned Virgin, who hast given birth to the divine Fire, burn up the tinder of the passions of those who hymn thee, and illumine all with the light of repentance, we pray. O incorrupt Maiden, deliver us from corruption; O animate palace of God, show us to be temples of the divine Spirit, that we may unceasingly hymn thee with faith in thy temple. Thou pourest forth streams of healings upon all, for thou hast given birth to the Source of life, O Theotokos. By thy fervent supplication cleanse this thy flock of defilement, O Bride of God. All the divine prophets, beholding the figures of thy divine birthgiving, chanted with joy, crying: O all-hymned God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Unconsumed by fire, the bush on Sinai spake unto Moses, * slow of speech and stammering, * and revealed God unto him; * and zeal for God showed forth the three Children who chanted hymns * to be unvanquished by the fire. * O all ye His works, praise ye the Lord * and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages. The blood and water which flowed from Thy side renewed the whole world and poured forth incorruption, O Savior, and brought abominable sacrifices and the shedding of corrupt blood to an end. Wherefore, all of us, Thy works, hymn Thee as Lord and supremely exalt Thee throughout all ages. Thou wast ringed about with a crown of thorns, wast given gall and vinegar to eat, wast spat upon, beaten and lifted up upon the Cross, Thy hands pierced with nails. And I, saved thereby, cry out to Thee: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Most splendidly enriched from the inexhaustible treasuries of truth, O spiritual athletes, ye spat upon all the poverty of the idols and showed yourselves to be enrichers of the poor, crying aloud: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having refused to obey the unlawful edicts of the tyrants, O martyrs, ye were cast into a fiery furnace like the youths, and therein found the dew of God which cooled you, as ye cried: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The ark of the law prefigured thee of old, O pure one, containing not the tablets of the law, but Christ, the Bestower of the law, Whom iniquitous men nailed to the Cross, and Who saveth us who cry: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The King of glory, who is alone without beginning, * Before Whom all the powers of heaven stand in awe * and the hosts of angels tremble: * O ye priests praise, and ye people * supremely exalt Him throughout the ages. Pouring forth an abyss of miracles upon the world, O all-hymned Virgin, dry up the stench of our passions, and pour forth the dew of remission upon us who honor thee with undoubting faith. The Sun of righteousness, Who shone forth from thee upon those sitting in the darkness of the passions, made thee light, O all-hymned and pure one; wherefore, we hymn thee as is meet, O Theotokos. As a most splendid temple of God, O pure one, show thy servants, assembled in thy holy temple, to be habitations of the Spirit; for we glorify thee throughout all ages. With the light of thy birthgiving thou hast wondrously enlightened the whole world, O Theotokos, bearing in thine arms the true God Who ever enlightens those who cry with faith: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the </p><p><i class="note">refrain:</i> “More honorable than the cherubim ...”<i class="note"> Prostrations.</i> </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Mother of God and Virgin, * thou hast given birth and yet remained a virgin, * not in accordance with nature, * but by the condescension of God; * wherefore, we ever magnify thee, * who alone wast deemed worthy * of the wonders of God.  The might of the enemy in nowise failed until Thou didst cry out mightily on the Tree to Thine beginningless Father, and called Thy scattered sheep to the knowledge of Thee, O Christ, mighty Master. Thou wast willingly lifted up upon the Cross like a lamb, O Master, snatching Thy reason-endowed sheep from the wolf, O Savior, and enclosing those who hymn thee in the fold of Thy precepts. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Shown to be emulators of Thy sufferings, the right glorious passion-bearers endured many and varied methods of torture, O Lover of mankind; wherefore, they received crowns of glory and have been deemed worthy of Thy kingdom, O Christ. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The solar rays of grace shine round about, illumining the faithful on the right laudable feast of the honored passion-bearers; wherefore, ever celebrating this, we are delivered from the darkness of grievous transgressions. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thy Son, the noetic Light, shone forth on the Cross O most pure one, rebuking the princes of darkness; and darkening the light of the sun, illumining the fullness of the faithful, O most immaculate one. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Conceiving without knowing corruption, * and lending thy flesh to the Word, * O Mother unwedded and Virgin Theotokos, * thou art the vessel of the Uncircumscribable One, * and dwelling place of thy Creator, * thee do we magnify. Thou wast shown to be more sacred than the hosts on high, for thou hast given birth to the Creator of all, O holy Theotokos, Mother who knewest not a man; wherefore, with the angels we glorify thee, unceasingly hymning thy mighty works. Enlightened by the rays of the divine Spirit, the most sacred prophet of old beheld thee as a mountain overshadowed, O Virgin Theotokos; wherefore, we on earth bless thee with the angels, as thou didst foretell, O thou who art blessed of God. Thou wast shown to be the jar holding the divine Manna, and wast seen to be a ladder leading mortals up from earth, O Virgin Theotokos who alone knewest not wedlock; wherefore, we, the faithful, having assembled, glorify thee as is meet, O divinely joyous one. O Maiden who wast the dwelling-place of the Godhead, bathing me with tears, cleanse me, who have become a den of soul-destroying thieves and a place where every iniquity is wrought; and show me to be an abode of the divine Spirit. O Virgin Lady, who alone hast given birth to the pre-eternal Light: Deliver me from everlasting darkness, and enlighten my soul which hath become wholly darkened through the passions of life, that I may ever glorify thee with love.

<h3>Psalm 85</h3>
A prayer of David
BOW down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor, and in misery.
Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: my God, save thy servant that putteth his
trust in thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I will call daily upon thee.
Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, art good and gracious: and of great mercy unto all them that call
upon thee.
Give ear, Lord, unto my prayer: and ponder the voice of my humble desires.
In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou hearest me.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord: there is not one that can do
as thou doest.
All nations whom thou hadst made shall come and worship thee, O Lord: and
shall glorify thy Name.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in thy truth: O knit my heart unto
thee, that I may fear thy Name.
I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and will praise thy Name for
evermore.
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the
nethermost hell.
O God, the proud are risen against me: and the congregations of naughty men
have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.
But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, plenteous
in goodness and truth.
O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength unto thy
servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.
Shew some token upon me for good, that they who hate me may see it and be
ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
<h3>Psalm 86</h3>
A psalm of a song for the sons of Core
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loveth the gates of Sion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Very excellent things are spoken of thee: thou city of God.
I will think upon Rahab and Babylon: with them that know me.
Behold ye the Philistines also: and they of Tyre, with the Morians; lo, there was
he born.
And of Sion it shall be reported that he was born in her: and the most High shall
stablish her.
The Lord shall rehearse it when he writeth up the people: that he was born
there.
The singers also and trumpeters shall he rehearse: All my fresh springs shall be
in thee.
<h3>Psalm 87</h3>
A song of a psalm for the sons of Core. For the end. Upon Maeleth, for responsive strains.
Concerning instruction for Æman the Israelite
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: O let my
prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling.
For my soul is full of trouble: and my life draweth nigh unto hell.
I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit: and I have been even as a
man that hath no strength.
Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded, and lie in the grave: who
are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit: in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
Thine indignation lieth hard upon me: and thou hast vexed me with all thy
storms.
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me: and made me to be
abhorred of them.
I am so fast in prison: that I cannot get forth.
My sight faileth for very trouble: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have
stretched forth my hands unto thee.
Dost thou shew wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise up again, and
praise thee?
Shall thy loving-kindness be shewed in the grave: or thy faithfulness in
destruction?
Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy righteousness in the
land where all things are forgotten?
Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come before thee.
Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face from me?
I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die: even from my youth
up thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me: and the fear of thee hath undone me.
They came round about me daily like water: and compassed me together on
every side.
My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me: and hid mine acquaintance
out of my sight.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 88</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Ætham the Israelite
MY SONG shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the Lord: with my mouth will I
ever be shewing thy truth from one generation to another.
For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever: thy truth shalt thou stablish in the
heavens.
I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn unto David my servant;
Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne from one generation to
another.
O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and thy truth in the
congregation of the saints.
For who is he among the clouds: that shall be compared unto the Lord?
And what is he among the gods: that shall be like unto the Lord?
God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints: and to be had in
reverence of all them that are round about him.
O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee: thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on
every side.
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.
Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it: thou hast scattered thine enemies
abroad with thy mighty arm.
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast laid the foundation of
the round world, and all that therein is.
Thou hast made the north and the south: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy
Name.
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat: mercy and truth shall go
before thy face.
Blessed is the people, O Lord, that can rejoice in thee: they shall walk in the light
of thy countenance.
Their delight shall be daily in thy Name: and in thy righteousness shall they
make their boast.
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy loving-kindness thou shalt lift
up our horns.
For the Lord is our defence: the Holy One of Israel is our King.
Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help
upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
I have found David my servant: with my holy oil have I anointed him.
My hand shall hold him fast: and my arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not be able to do him violence: the son of wickedness shall not
hurt him.
I will smite down his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.
My truth also and my mercy shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be
exalted.
I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand in the floods.
He shall call me, Thou art my Father: my God, and my strong salvation.
And I will make him my first-born: higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast with
him.
His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the days of
heaven.
But if his children forsake my law: and walk not in my judgements;
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I will visit their
offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.
Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my
truth to fail.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: I
have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David.
His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the sun before me.
He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the faithful witness in
heaven.
But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed: and art displeased at him.
Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his crown to the ground.
Thou hast overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong holds.
All they that go by spoil him: and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all his adversaries to
rejoice.
Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword: and givest him not victory in the
battle.
Thou hast put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: and covered him with dishonour.
Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever: and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
O remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men for
nought?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death: and shall he deliver his soul
from the hand of hell?
Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses: which thou swarest unto David in thy
truth?
Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I do bear in my
bosom the rebukes of many people.
Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of
thine Anointed: Praised be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

<h3>Psalm 89</h3>
A prayer of Moses the man of God
LORD, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of
men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a
watch in the night.
As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut down,
dried up and withered.
For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance.
For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our years to an end, as
it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong
that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but labour and
sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.
But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man feareth,
so is thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be glad all the
days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us: and for the years
wherein we have suffered adversity.
Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou the work
of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handywork.
<h3>Psalm 90</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the most High: shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty..
I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my strong hold: my God, in him
will I trust.
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome
pestilence.
He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers:
his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by
day;
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness that destroyeth
in the noon-day.
A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall
not come nigh thee.
Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold: and see the reward of the ungodly.
For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of defence very high.
There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou
tread under thy feet.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him
up, because he hath known my Name.
He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble; I will
deliver him, and bring him to honour.
With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation.

<h3>Psalm 91</h3>
A psalm of a song for the Sabbath-day
IT IS a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy
Name, O most Highest.
To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning: and of thy truth in the nightseason.
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute: upon a loud instrument,
and upon the harp.
For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works: and I will rejoice in giving
praise for the operations of thy hands.
O Lord, how glorious are thy works: thy thoughts are very deep.
An unwise man doth not well consider this: and a fool doth not understand it.
When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish: then shall they be destroyed for ever; but thou,
Lord, art the most Highest for evermore.
For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, lo, thine enemies shall perish: and all the workers
of wickedness shall be destroyed.
But mine horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn: for I am anointed with
fresh oil.
Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies: and mine ear shall hear his
desire of the wicked that arise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar
in Libanus.
Such as are planted in the house of the Lord: shall flourish in the courts of the
house of our God.
They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age: and shall be fat and wellliking.
That they may shew how true the Lord my strength is: and that there is no
unrighteousness in him.
<h3>Psalm 92</h3>
For the day before the Sabbath. When the land was first inhabited, the praise of a song by David
THE Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his
apparel, and girded himself with strength.
He hath made the round world so sure: that it cannot be moved.
Ever since the world began hath thy seat been prepared: thou art from
everlasting.
The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lift up their voice: the floods lift up
their waves.
The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly: but yet the Lord, who
dwelleth on high, is mightier.
Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becometh thine house for ever.
<h3>Psalm 93</h3>
A psalm of David for the fourth day of the week
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth: thou God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself.
Arise, thou Judge of the world: and reward the proud after their deserving.
Lord, how long shall the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly triumph?
How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully: and make such proud
boasting?
They smite down thy people, O Lord: and trouble thine heritage.
They murder the widow and the stranger: and put the fatherless to death.
And yet they say, Tush, the Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob
regard it.
Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the eye, shall he not
see?
Or he that nurtureth the heathen: it is he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not
he punish?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man: that they are but vain.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him in thy law.
That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity: until the pit be digged
up for the ungodly.
For the Lord will not fail his people: neither will he forsake his inheritance;
Until righteousness turn again unto judgement: all such as are true in heart shall
follow it.
Who will rise up with me against the wicked: or who will take my part against
the evil-doers?
If the Lord had not helped me: it had not failed but my soul had been put to
silence.
But when I said, My foot hath slipt: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.
In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart: thy comforts have
refreshed my soul.
Wilt thou have any thing to do with the stool of wickedness: which imagineth
mischief as a law?
They gather them together against the soul of the righteous: and condemn the
innocent blood.
But the Lord is my refuge: and my God is the strength of my confidence.
He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own
malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

<h3>Psalm 94</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
O COME, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our
salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: and shew ourselves glad in
him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God: and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hills is his
also.
The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep
of his hand.
To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the provocation,
and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: It is a people that
do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways;
Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.
<h3>Psalm 95</h3>
When the house was built after the captivity. A song by David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the whole earth.
Sing unto the Lord, and praise his Name: be telling of his salvation from day to
day.
Declare his honour unto the heathen: and his wonders unto all people.
For the Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised: he is more to be feared
than all gods.
As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols: but it is the Lord that made
the heavens.
Glory and worship are before him: power and honour are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people: ascribe unto the Lord
worship and power.
Ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his Name: bring presents, and come
into his courts.
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let the whole earth stand in awe of
him.
Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King: and that it is he who hath
made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; and how that he
shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea make a noise, and
all that therein is.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood
rejoice before the Lord.
For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: and with righteousness to judge
the world, and the people with his truth.
<h3>Psalm 96</h3>
For David, when his land is established
THE Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
may be glad thereof.
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgement are the
habitation of his seat.
There shall go a fire before him: and burn up his enemies on every side.
His lightnings gave shine unto the world: the earth saw it, and was afraid.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord
of the whole earth.
The heavens have declared his righteousness: and all the people have seen his
glory.
Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in vain
gods: worship him, all ye gods.
Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad, because of
thy judgements, O Lord.
For thou, Lord, art higher than all that are in the earth: thou art exalted far
above all gods.
O ye that love the Lord, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: the Lord
preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of
the ungodly.
There is sprung up a light for the righteous: and the joyful gladness for such as
are true-hearted.
Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous: and give thanks for a remembrance of his
holiness.

<h3>Psalm 97</h3>
A Psalm of David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous things.
With his own right hand, and with his holy arm: hath he gotten himself the
victory.
The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the
sight of the heathen.
He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel: and all the
ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.
Shew yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing, rejoice, and give thanks.
Praise the Lord upon the harp: sing to the harp with a psalm of thanksgiving.
With trumpets also and shawms: O shew yourselves joyful before the Lord the
King.
Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round world, and they that
dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together before the
Lord: for he is come to judge the earth.
With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with equity.
<h3>Psalm 98</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord is King, be the people never so unpatient: he sitteth between the
cherubims, be the earth never so unquiet.
The Lord is great in Sion: and high above all people.
They shall give thanks unto thy Name: which is great, wonderful, and holy.
The King's power loveth judgement; thou hast prepared equity: thou hast
executed judgement and righteousness in Jacob.
O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before his footstool, for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call upon his
Name: these called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar: for they kept his testimonies, and
the law that he gave them.
Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou forgavest them, O God, and
punishedst their own inventions.
O magnify the Lord our God, and worship him upon his holy hill: for the Lord our
God is holy.
<h3>Psalm 99</h3>
A psalm for thanksgiving
O BE joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come
before his presence with a song.
Be ye sure that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we
ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:
be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.
For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting: and his truth endureth from
generation to generation.
<h3>Psalm 100</h3>
A Psalm of David
MY SONG shall be of mercy and judgement: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.
O let me have understanding: in the way of godliness.
When wilt thou come unto me: I will walk in my house with a perfect heart.
I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of unfaithfulness: there shall
no such cleave unto me.
A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour: him will I destroy.
Whoso hath also a proud look and high stomach: I will not suffer him.
Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land: that they may dwell with
me.
Whoso leadeth a godly life: he shall be my servant.
There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house: he that telleth lies shall not
tarry in my sight.
I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land: that I may root out all
wicked doers from the city of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 101</h3>
A prayer for the poor, when he is deeply afflicted and pours out his supplication before the Lord
HEAR my prayer, O Lord: and let my crying come unto thee.
Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine ear unto me
when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.
For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt up as it
were a firebrand.
My heart is smitten down, and withered liked grass: so that I forget to eat my
bread.
For the voice of my groaning: my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.
I am become like a pelican in the wilderness: and like an owl that is in the desert.
I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that sitteth alone upon the
house-top.
Mine enemies revile me all the day long: and they that are mad upon me are
sworn together against me.
For I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping.
And that because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and
cast me down.
My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.
But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever: and thy remembrance throughout all
generations.
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that thou have mercy
upon her, yea, the time is come.
And why? thy servants think upon her stones: and it pitieth them to see her in
the dust.
The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy
majesty;
When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall appear;
When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute: and despiseth not
their desire.
This shall be written for those that come after: and the people which shall be
born shall praise the Lord.
For he hath looked down from his sanctuary: out of the heaven did the Lord
behold the earth;
That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity: and deliver the
children appointed unto death;
That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion: and his worship at
Jerusalem;
When the people are gathered together: and the kingdoms also, to serve the
Lord.
He brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.
But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age: as for thy
years, they endure throughout all generations.
Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax old as doth a
garment;
And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art
the same, and thy years shall not fail.
The children of thy servants shall continue: and their seed shall stand fast in thy
sight.
<h3>Psalm 102</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me praise his holy Name.
Praise the Lord, O my soul: and forget not all his benefits;
Who forgiveth all thy sin: and healeth all thine infirmities;
Who saveth thy life from destruction: and crowneth thee with mercy and lovingkindness;
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: making thee young and lusty as an
eagle.
The Lord executeth righteousness and judgement: for all them that are
oppressed with wrong.
He shewed his ways unto Moses: his works unto the children of Israel.
The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and of great goodness.
He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth he his anger for ever.
He hath not dealt with us after our sins: nor rewarded us according to our
wickednesses.
For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth: so great is his mercy
also toward them that fear him.
Look how wide also the east is from the west: so far hath he set our sins from us.
Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children: even so is the Lord merciful unto
them that fear him.
For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that we are but dust.
The days of man are but as grass: for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.
For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone: and the place thereof shall know
it no more.
But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon them that
fear him: and his righteousness upon children's children;
Even upon such as keep his covenant: and think upon his commandments to do
them.
The Lord hath prepared his seat in heaven: and his kingdom ruleth over all.
O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength: ye that fulfil his
commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words.
O praise the Lord, all ye his hosts: ye servants of his that do his pleasure.
O speak good of the Lord, all ye works of his, in all places of his dominion: praise
thou the Lord, O my soul.

<h3>Psalm 103</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art become exceeding
glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.
Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment: and spreadest out the
heavens like a curtain.
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: and maketh the clouds his
chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.
He maketh his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire.
He laid the foundations of the earth: that it never should move at any time.
Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment: the waters stand in the
hills.
At thy rebuke they flee: at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.
They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath: even unto the
place which thou hast appointed for them.
Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass: neither turn again to
cover the earth.
He sendeth the springs into the rivers: which run among the hills.
All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild asses quench their thirst.
Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation: and sing among the
branches.
He watereth the hills from above: the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
He bringeth forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the service of men;
That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of
man: and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen
man's heart.
The trees of the Lord also are full of sap: even the cedars of Libanus which he
hath planted;
Wherein the birds make their nests: and the fir-trees are a dwelling for the stork.
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats: and so are the stony rocks for the
conies.
He appointed the moon for certain seasons: and the sun knoweth his going down.
Thou makest darkness that it may be night: wherein all the beasts of the forest
do move.
The lions roaring after their prey: do seek their meat from God.
The sun ariseth, and they get them away together: and lay them down in their
dens.
Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour: until the evening.
O Lord, how manifold are thy works: in wisdom hast thou made them all; the
earth is full of thy riches.
So is the great and wide sea also: wherein are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great beasts.
There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan: whom thou hast made to take his
pastime therein.
These wait all upon thee: that thou mayest give them meat in due season.
When thou givest it them they gather it: and when thou openest thy hand they
are filled with good.
When thou hidest thy face they are troubled: when thou takest away their breath
they die, and are turned again to their dust.
When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made: and thou shalt renew
the face of the earth.
The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in
his works.
The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch the hills, they shall
smoke.
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will praise my God while I have my
being.
And so shall my words please him: my joy shall be in the Lord.
As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall
come to an end: praise thou the Lord, O my soul, praise the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 104</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his Name: tell the people what
things he hath done.
O let your songs be of him, and praise him: and let your talking be of all his
wondrous works.
Rejoice in his holy Name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek the Lord and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Remember the marvellous works that he hath done: his wonders, and the
judgements of his mouth.
O ye seed of Abraham his servant: ye children of Jacob his chosen.
He is the Lord our God: his judgements are in all the world.
He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise: that he made to a
thousand generations;
Even the covenant that he made with Abraham: and the oath that he sware unto
Isaac;
And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law: and to Israel for an everlasting
testament;
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan: the lot of your inheritance;
When there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in the land;
What time as they went from one nation to another: from one kingdom to another
people;
He suffered no man to do them wrong: but reproved even kings for their sakes;
Touch not mine Anointed: and do my prophets no harm.
Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land: and destroyed all the provision of
bread.
But he had sent a man before them: even Joseph, who was sold to be a bondservant;
Whose feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his soul;
Until the time came that his cause was known: the word of the Lord tried him.
The king sent, and delivered him: the prince of the people let him go free.
He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his substance;
That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach his senators wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people exceedingly: and made them stronger than their
enemies.
Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people: and dealt untruly with his
servants.
Then sent he Moses his servant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.
And these shewed his tokens among them: and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and it was dark: and they were not obedient unto his word.
He turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs: yea, even in their kings' chambers.
He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies: and lice in all their
quarters.
He gave them hail-stones for rain: and flames of fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and fig-trees: and destroyed the trees that were in
their coasts.
He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable:
and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their
ground.
He smote all the first-born in their land: even the chief of all their strength.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person
among their tribes.
Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were afraid of them.
He spread out a cloud to be a covering: and fire to give light in the night-season.
At their desire he brought quails: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in the
dry places.
For why? he remembered his holy promise: and Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy: and his chosen with gladness.
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people
in possession;
That they might keep his statutes: and observe his laws.

O disciples of Christ, who drew men forth from the depths of ignorance with the net of the Word, save me who am tempest-tossed and drowning amid countless transgressions. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> With the angels, martyrs and apostles entreat thy Son and Lord, O all-immaculate one, that thy servants may be saved from all perils and tribulations. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of Saint Nicholas </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Thou didst bedew the burning furnace, O Savior, * and didst save the children who chanted, proclaiming: * Blessed art Thou throughout the ages, * O Lord God of our fathers!  As the beauty of the Church, O wise Nicholas, deliver me from all the ugliness of the shameful passions, ever entreating the Benefactor of the whole world, O holy hierarch. Water the hearts of us all with the showers of thy prayers, O wise Nicholas, that we may offer fruits worthy of repentance, O holy hierarch. By thy prayers enlighten the minds of us who rise early with faith and glorify God, O thou who by thine entreaties razed the temple of Artemis. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> With faith every tongue glorifies thee, who art the glory and boast of our race and the guide of those astray, O pure and all-blessed Theotokos. </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Apostles </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Unconsumed by fire, the bush on Sinai spake unto Moses, * slow of speech and stammering, * and revealed God unto him; * and zeal for God showed forth the three Children who chanted hymns * to be unvanquished by the fire. * O all ye His works, praise ye the Lord * and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages. Like coals set aflame by the noetic Fire, the disciples of Christ burned up all the falsehood of idolatry as if they were reeds, and have enlightened the souls of the faithful, who cry aloud: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages. <i class="note">Twice.</i></p><p> Enlighten now my soul which hath been darkened by sin, and my heart which through the passions hath been enshrouded in the gloom of dishonor, O apostles of Christ who partake of everlasting light, that I may unceasingly cry aloud: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages. By the supplications of Thy sacred disciples heal my soul, which hath been wounded by the venomous fangs of the prideful one, O Thou Who accepted wounds in the flesh; and save those who chant: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> When thou hast given birth to the Fire without being consumed, thou wast preserved, O most pure Virgin; wherefore, with the incorporeal choirs and the apostles entreat Him to Whom thou hast given birth, that they may be saved who chant with faith: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of Saint Nicholas </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Emulating the children who in the furnace * received the dew of the Spirit, * let us cry out with faith saying: * Bless the Lord, O ye works of the Lord! Thy body, fragrant with myrrh, which lay in Myra, O most holy Nicholas, poureth forth myrrh upon those who have recourse thereto, bringing an end to the infirmities of mortals. The Creator and Lord of the world hath shown thee to be a helper of the world; wherefore, thou hast been found to be a ready deliverer for those who now call upon thee in their needs, O Nicholas. There is no-one who calleth upon thee amid tribulations who doth not speedily receive consolation; wherefore, we pray to thee: Ease all our sicknesses, O Nicholas. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Every tongue hymneth and glorifieth thee, O Virgin Bride of God, for thou hast given birth to the all-hymned God. Him do thou unceasingly beseech, that our souls be saved. We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the </p><p><i class="note">refrain:</i> “More honorable than the cherubim ...”<i class="note"> Prostrations.</i> </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Apostles </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Conceiving without knowing corruption, * and lending thy flesh to the Word, * O Mother unwedded and Virgin Theotokos, * thou art the vessel of the Uncircumscribable One, * and dwelling place of thy Creator, * thee do we magnify. The Word of God the Father revealed you to be sons of the light and the day, for having loved Him, O divine apostles, ye were shown to be beacons for the whole world, dispellers of demons, guides for the lost and firm foundations for the Church. O ploughs of the Word, who bore His most easy yoke upon your necks, cultivate now my soul, which hath grown hard through the passions, and render it fertile with the seed of repentance. Through the divine Spirit the earth is sanctified by the divine relics of the right glorious apostles; and the heavenly Church of the firstborn is unceasingly made splendid by their spirits. For their sake, O Savior, have pity upon us all. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O abundantly Compassionate and greatly Merciful One, the Virgin who gave birth to Thee, and the divine incorporeal choirs, the apostles and prophets, the martyrs and holy hierarchs, and the souls of the righteous, entreat Thee to not inflict upon me the fire prepared for me. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of Saint Nicholas </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O ye faithful, with hymns let us magnify the Theotokos, * who in a manner transcending nature became a mother, * and is a Virgin by nature, * she alone is blessed among women! Following the ways of the sacred apostles, thou didst inherit their throne, as an honorable and holy hierarch, O right glorious Nicholas. O blessed one, the Creator hath shown thee forth as most great, as a lover of God and a helper in all things for those who fervently call upon thee throughout the world. With contrite heart we cry to thee, O father Nicholas: Be thou a comfort for us amid tribulations, ever driving griefs away from our souls. The severing of death lieth before thee like an axe lying before a tree, O my soul. Wherefore, be not slothful but diligent in showing God the fruits of repentance. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> In thy holy arms thou bearest Him Who upholdeth all things. Him do thou beseech, O pure one, that we be saved unharmed by the scheming of the alien one.

        <p><i class="note">Stichera of the apostles, in Tone VII:</i></p>O glorious apostles, pillars of the Church, preachers of the Truth, radiant 
beacons: With the fire of the Spirit ye consumed all delusion and illumined the 
race of mankind with faith. Wherefore, we beseech you: Entreat our Savior and 
God, that He grant peace to the world and save our souls. 
</p></p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, O Lord, and we 
rejoiced and were glad.<p> In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein 
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon 
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons. 
O apostles of Christ, husbandmen of the Savior, bearing the Cross upon your 
shoulders as a plough, and having cleared the earth made hard by the delusion of 
idolatry, ye sowed the word of faith, and are therefore fittingly honored, O holy 
apostles of Christ. 
</p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the 
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our 
hands do Thou guide aright. 
</p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Breathing forth one thing only, and looking toward one thing 
alone, the passion-bearing martyrs, having found the one path of life, which is 
death for Christ, urged one another on to death. O the wonder! For, snatching up 
the treasures of torment, they said to each other: If we die not now, we shall die in 
any case; wherefore, let us do things worthy of life: let us do what needs be done 
with love of honor, that we may sell what we have and purchase life with death!” 
By their prayers, O God, have mercy on us. 
</p><p>Glory ..., Now & Ever ...,</p><p></p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> 
Thou wast ineffably born from the Virgin, O Christ, enlightening those in 
darkness, who cry aloud: Glory be to Thee, O Lord!
