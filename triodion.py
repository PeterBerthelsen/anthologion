                their pursuer Pharaoh drowned, * they cried: * Let us sing to God * a song
                of victory.

                By parables Christ hath led all mankind to a life of amendment: Raising up
                the Publican from humbleness, he showed the Pharisee who exalted himself to
                be humbled.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                From humility cometh an exalted honor, but from pride we see a grievous
                fall; let us, then, strive to emulate the good actions of the Publican, and hate the
                evil ones of the Pharisee.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                Every good deed is rendered useless through pride, while every evil is
                cleansed by humility. Wherefore, let us in faith embrace humility, and utterly
                abhor the ways of vainglory.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                The King of all, wishing His own disciples to be humble-minded, taught

                From the dung-hill of the passions the humble are lifted up on high, while
                from the height of the virtues the high-minded suffer a grievous fall: let us flee
                such an image of wickedness.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.

                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                Zealously, O ye faithful, let us increase in meekness, and with humility let us
                live out the days of our lives in suffering of the heart, weeping and prayer, that
                we may receive forgiveness from God.
                Glory ..., Let us cast away, ye faithful, the high-minded boasting and hurtful
                pride of the Pharisee, and his most wicked, repugnant to God, malice.
                Now & ever ..., In thee, my only refuge, have I set my trust: let me not fall
                away from my good hope, but grant me thy protection, O pure One, and deliver
                me from every evil snare of my wicked enemies.
                Katavasia: O Theotokos, thou living and plentiful fount, * establish in
                spiritual fellowship those who sing hymns to thee, * and in thy divine
                glory * grant them crowns of glory.
                Sessional Hymns from the Triodion, in Tone IV:
                Humility exalted the Publican who was overcome with shame at his evil
                deeds, * when he cried to the Creator, “Be merciful:” * but exaltation brought
                down from righteousness the wretched Pharisee who spoke boastfully. *
                Therefore let us earnestly desire that which is good ** and avoid that which is
                evil.
                Glory ..., Of old humility exalted the Publican * who cried aloud with tears,
                * “Be merciful,” and he was justified. * Let us all follow his example, * for we
                have fallen into the depths of evil. * Let us cry to the Savior from the depths of
                our hearts: ** We have sinned, be merciful, O Thou Who alone lovest mankind.
                Now & ever ..., Be swift to receive our prayers, O Lady, * and bring them to
                thy Son and God, all-immaculate Sovereign Lady. * Deliver from tribulations

                who godlessly war against thy servants, O most pure One.

                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                The Word, set an example showing that the path to exaltation is humility,
                having humbled Himself even unto taking the form of a servant, thereby
                instructing all, that he who humbleth himself shall be exalted on high.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                The righteous Pharisee exalted himself and fell, wickedly rejecting humility,
                but through humility the Publican was exalted and justified.

                He who was without need of virtue was deprived of them, and shown to be

                O Lord, Thou didst forewarn all that Thou dost resist the high-minded, but

                for we have humbled ourselves.
                Glory ..., The Savior and Master, ever leading us to blessed exaltation, hath
                shown us that it is humility that raises one on high, for with His own hands He
                didst wash the feet of the disciples.

                the hand, guide my life into the path of salvation.
                Katavasia: He who sitteth in glory upon the throne of the Godhead, *
                Jesus the true God, * is come in a swift cloud * and with His sinless hands
                he hath saved those who cry: * Glory to Thy power, O Christ.

                O Word of God, * as the true God, * Who recalleth us from the darkness of
                sin.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                Let us make haste to follow the Pharisee in his virtues and to emulate the
                Publican in his humility, and let us hate what is wrong in each of them: foolish
                opinion and the fall into self-destruction.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                The righteousness of the Pharisee proved to be vain and was condemned,
                for it was yoked to prideful opinion; However the Publican became a cocompanion of humility, the virtue which exalts one on high.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                The Pharisee thought to drive swiftly in the chariot of the virtues; but the
                Publican outran him on foot, for he had yoked humility to compassion.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                Pondering with our minds the parable of the Publican, let us all emulate him

                Glory ..., Let us cast far away the wicked haughtiness and boasting of the
                Pharisee, that we may not be stripped of divine grace.

                unto thee, grant them victory in the midst of all enemies and deliver them from
                every evil circumstance.
                Katavasia: All creation stands in awe of thy divine glory; * for thou, O
                Virgin who hast not known wedlock, * didst contain within thy womb the
                God of all, * and gave birth to the timeless Son, * bestowing peace, upon
                all who hymn thee.

                corruption, * O Most Merciful One.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                The Publican along with the Pharisee ran the race of life, but the one was
                overcome by high-mindedness and shipwrecked, while the other was saved by
                humility.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                Changing to a humble course of life, let us emulate the fervent wisdom of

                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                Let us fervently follow the ways of Jesus the Savior and His humility, if we

                living.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                O Master, Thou hast shown to Thy disciples the humility that raiseth men
                on high, for girding Thy loins with a towel, and washing their feet Thou didst
                prepare them to follow Thine example.
                Glory ..., The Pharisee passed his life in virtue and the Publican in sin; but
                the former was brought low by his pride, while the latter was raised on high by
                his humble-mindedness.
                Now & ever ..., I was formed naked in innocence and simplicity; but the
                enemy hath clothed me in the raiment of transgressions and the grossness of the
                flesh. But by thine intercessions, O Maiden, I have been saved.
                Katavasia: Celebrating the divine and solemn feast * of the Mother of God
                * O ye divinely wise, * let us come, clapping our hands, * and glorify God
                who was born of her.
                Kontakion from the Triodion, in Tone IV
                Let us flee from the proud-speaking of the Pharisee * and learn from the
                Publican the loftiness of words of humility, * and with penitential lamentation let
                us cry aloud: “O Savior of the world ** be merciful to us, and cleanse us Thy
                servants’.
                Ikos : Let us all humble ourselves, brethren; sighing and lamenting, beating
                our conscience, that at the eternal judgment we may be numbered with the
                faithful and the righteous, and receive forgiveness. Let us pray that we behold the
                place truly peaceful, where there is neither pain, nor sorrow, nor sighing from the
                soul, in the wondrous Eden fashioned by Christ, for He is God coeternal with
                the Father.
                SYNAXARION READING:
                With God, on this present day we begin the Triodion, the hymns of which
                were composed by many of our holy and God-bearing Fathers, inspired by the
                Holy Spirit according to their worthiness. The first of all was the great author
                Cosmas of Maiuma, who composed the three odes (symbolic of the Holy and
                Life-Creating Trinity) for the Great and Holy Week of the Passion of our Lord
                and God and Savior Jesus Christ. After him others of the Fathers, including
                Theodore and Joseph of the Studite Monastery, following his zealous example,
                arranged the services of the other weeks of the Holy and Great Forty-day Fast,
                reserving them at first for the use of the Studite Monastery. Furthermore they
                composed and arranged hymns, seeking them and collecting them from other
                books of the Fathers. Since, according to the Triodion, Sunday, the celebration
                of the Resurrection, is the first day of the week as well as the last or eighth day,
                they prescribed the first ODE of the canon to be sung on the second day of the
                week, i.e. Monday. The second ODE was prescribed for Tuesday, the third day
                of the week, the third ODE for Wednesday, the fourth ODE for Thursday, the
                fifth ODE for Friday, and the sixth and seventh ODES for Saturday. The rest,
                the eighth and ninth ODES, are prescribed for every day. It must be known,
                however, that although it is called the Triodion, it does have services with other
                than three-ODE canons. It is so named because the majority of the services have
                three ODE canons, especially during Holy Week. For it was our Holy Fathers’
                idea that through the entire Triodion would be commemorated in a concise form
                all God’s benefits to us from the beginning, using it as a reminder for all of us
                that we were created by Him, and were exiled from Paradise through the tasting
                of the fruit, rejecting the commandment that was given to us for our knowledge,
                and we were cast out through the envy of the arch villain serpent and enemy,
                who was made to crawl for his arrogance. That we remained cut off from the
                benefits of Paradise and were led by the devil. That the Son and Word of God,
                having suffered in His mercy, bowing the heavens, descended and made His
                abode in the Virgin and became man for our sake, showing us through His life
                the ascent into the heavens, through humility first of all then fasting and the
                rejection of evil and through His other deeds. That He suffered and rose from
                the dead and ascended once more into heaven, and He sent down the Holy Spirit
                upon His holy disciples and Apostles, who all proclaimed Him to be the Son of
                God and the most perfect God. And that once more the divine Apostles acted
                through the grace of the most Holy Spirit and gathered all the saints from the
                ends of the earth through their preaching, filling the world on high, which was
                the intention of the Creator from the beginning. Now the purpose of the
                Triodion intended by the Holy Fathers on these three present feasts of the
                Publican and the Pharisee, the Prodigal Son, and the Second Coming is a kind of
                preparatory lesson and stimulation to prepare ourselves for the spiritual labors of
                the Fast, having put aside our usual corrupt habits. First of all they present to us
                the parable of the Publican and the Pharisee, and they call the week following
                precursory. For those who desire to go off to do military battle, first ascertain the
                time of the battle from the leaders, so that having cleaned and polished their
                weapons, and preparing well all their other matters, and having removed all
                obstacles from their path, they earnestly go forth to their labors, taking the
                necessary supplies. Often before battle they tell anecdotes and tales and parables
                to incite their hearts to zeal, driving off idleness, fear, despair and other
                inadequate feelings. So the divine Fathers herald the coming fast against the
                armies of demons as a passion which holds fast our souls to cleanse ourselves of
                the poison accumulated over a long period of time. Not yet possessing those
                benefits, let us strive to obtain them, and arming ourselves properly, so let us set
                off to the labors of the Fast. Now the first weapon among the virtues is
                repentance and humility. And the temptation to attain the greatest humility is
                pride and arrogance. So they place before us first of all this present trustworthy
                parable from the Divine Gospel. It encourages us to shun the desire for the pride
                and arrogance of the Pharisee, and to cultivate the opposite desire of the
                Publican for humility and repentance. For the greatest and most grievous passion
                is pride and arrogance, since this is how the Devil fell from the heavens before
                the morning star and was cast into darkness. Because of this Adam, the father of
                our race, was driven from Paradise through partaking of the fruit. Through this
                example the Holy Fathers encourage all not to be proud of their successes, but
                always to be humble. For the Lord sets Himself against the proud, but He gives
                grace to the humble. Better a man who has sinned, if he knows that he has
                sinned and repents, than a man who has not sinned and thinks of himself as
                righteous. For Christ said, “I say to you that the Publican went down to his
                house justified rather than the Pharisee.” This parable reveals that no one should
                exalt himself, even though he has done good deeds, but rather should always be
                humble and pray from his heart to God, for even if he should fall into the most
                serious sin, salvation is not far off
                Through the prayers of all Thy holy Hymnographers,
                O Christ our God, have mercy on us. Amen.

                Irmos: An Angel made the furnace bedew the holy Children. * But the
                command of God consumed the Chaldeans * and prevailed upon the
                tyrant to cry: * O God of our fathers, Blessed art Thou.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                Exalted by the works of self-justification, the Pharisee was grievously snared
                in the nets of vainglory, boasting madly; but the Publican was lifted on high on
                the light wings of humility, and drew near to God.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                Using humility as a ladder, the Publican was raised on high to the heights of
                heaven; but by the putrid foolishness of pride the wretched Pharisee fell into the
                abyss of Hades.
                Refrain: Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me.
                The enemy doth catch the righteous and despoil them through vainglory,
                blinding sinners in the nets of despair. But let us emulate the Publican and hasten

                to be lofty of wisdom, but to be numbered with those who are humble-minded.
                Therefore, O Savior, in faith we cry aloud to Thee: O God of our fathers,
                blessed art Thou.

                The humble-minded sighing of the Publican found the mercy of the Lord,

                merciful compassion, do Thou cleanse and save us.”
                Refrain: Let us bless the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Lord!
                God accepted the groaning of the Publican and having justified him, hath
                shown unto us all, that He is quickly turned to compassion by the sighings and
                tears of those who ask for the forgiveness of sins.
                Now & ever ..., I know of no other intercessor save thee, I offer thee, O
                pure and all-immaculate One, as my mediator before Him Whom thou didst

                worthy to be called Thy children as we were before. But since Thou art by nature

                Verse: For the gates of God’s mercies are opened to all.
                On this day we celebrate the Sunday of the Prodigal Son, dedicated as the
                second service of the Triodion by the divine Fathers for the following reason.
                There are some who recognize much in themselves that is unbecoming, who live
                a life of great dissipation from their youth, whose lives are full of drunkenness
                and immorality, who having fallen thus into the depths of evil, become
                despondent, giving birth to pride, from whence they have no desire to advance
                to any of the virtues, preferring their bondage to evil and falling ever deeper into
                evil. Having a fatherly love for even these individuals, and desiring to lead them
                out of their despair, the Holy Fathers prescribed this parable for the second
                preparatory Sunday in order to tear up the passion of despair by the roots, to
                lead them to acceptance of the virtues, and to demonstrate to sinners the
                abundance of God’s compassion upon sinners and prodigals in His great
                goodness and love for mankind. For there is no sin which cannot be overcome
                by the knowledge of His love for mankind, and this is what is presented in this
                parable of Christ. Now the sons of man, that is of the Word, God and Man, are
                two: the righteous and the sinful. It is the eldest who abides ever in God’s
                blessings, following His commandments and remaining always by Him. But the
                younger son, having become attached to sin and renouncing his closeness to
                God through shameful deeds, has wasted God’s love for mankind and for him
                and has lived as a prodigal. For having completely rejected Him after whose
                image he was created, and having followed an evil demon, willingly enslaving
                himself to this demon’s pleasure, he was unable to fulfill his desire. For sin is an
                unsatisfying thing that becomes an habitual source of temporary pleasure. It may
                be compared to the husks that are fed to swine. At first it seems that they might
                be something tasty, but they turn out to be very dry and are much like weeds,
                which is how sin takes possession. For the Prodigal Son had hardly come to his
                senses when, perishing from hunger for virtue, he comes to his father, saying,
                “Father, I have sinned before heaven and before thee, and I am not worthy to be
                called thy son.” Yet the father receives him in repentance, not reproaching him,
                but embracing him and kissing him in a display of divine and fatherly love. And
                he clothes him, a symbol of baptism, putting a ring on his finger, a symbol of the
                grace of the most holy Spirit. He also puts sandals on his feet, not so much as a
                protection from some serpent or scorpion that might sting him on his path to
                God, but rather as a means of crushing the heads of those creatures. And then in
                a tremendous display of joy he slaughters the fatted calf for him, his onlybegotten Son, and the Father grants him communion of his body and blood.
                Now the elder son expresses his amazement at his father’s limitless mercy. But
                the lover of mankind exhorts him to silence with loving and kind words of
                humility, saying, “Thou art ever with me, and it was meet that we should make
                merry and be glad, for my son was formerly dead in his sin and is alive again,
                having repented of the foolish things he has done. He was lost, since he was far
                from me in his licentious habits, and he was found by me, suffering in my
                compassion and calling him back in my mercy.” This parable may be applied to
                us as well, which is why the holy Fathers have prescribed it for today. We who
                have sinned as the prodigal are encouraged to weed out despair and fear through
                repentance, confession and good deeds. For this is a great aid and a powerful
                weapon against the assaults of the adversary.
                In Thine ineffable love for mankind, O Christ our God,
                have mercy upon us. Amen.

                1ST EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS: (I COR 6:12-20)
                Brethren: All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all
                things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. Meats
                for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.
                Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the
                body. And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his
                own power. Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I
                then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God
                forbid. What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for
                two, saith he, shall be one flesh. But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
                Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that
                committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. What? know ye not that
                your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of
                God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify
                God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.

                GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE (15:11-32)
                The Lord spake a parable saying: A certain man had two sons: And the
                younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that
                falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after the
                younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and
                there wasted his substance with riotous living. And when he had spent all, there
                arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. And he went and
                joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed
                swine. And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did
                eat: and no man gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said, How
                many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish
                with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I
                have sinned against heaven, and before thee, And am no more worthy to be
                called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose, and came to
                his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had
                compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto
                him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more
                worthy to be called thy son. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the
                best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
                And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: For this
                my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to
                be merry. Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to
                the house, he heard musick and dancing. And he called one of the servants, and
                asked what these things meant. And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and
                thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and
                sound. And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out,
                and intreated him. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
                serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou
                never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: But as soon as
                this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast
                killed for him the fatted calf. And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me,
                and all that I have is thine. It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad:
                for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

                Refrain: Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel.
                See now, see that I am your God, who in righteous judgment hath fixed the
                bounds of life, bringing forth from corruption into incorruption all who have
                fallen asleep in the hope of the eternal resurrection.
                Refrain: Grant rest, O Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants.
                O Lord, Thou receivest from the four corners of the earth those who have
                died in faith, at sea and on the land, in rivers, springs, lakes or wells, devoured
                by wild beasts, birds or creeping things. Grant rest to them all.
                Refrain: Grant rest, O Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants.
                O Lord, all that is, is in the palm of Thy hand, Thou dost discern all things
                a-priori, before they dissolve into the four elements: in Thy coming do Thou
                restore and raise up all, forgiving them all their offences committed in
                knowledge or in ignorance.
                Refrain: Grant rest, O Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants.
                O Lord, how fearful shall be Thy second coming! For as lightning Thou
                shalt come on earth and raise up all Thy creatures to be judged. Grant to those
                who lived with faith in Thee, to meet Thee on that day and be counted worthy
                to dwell with Thee.
                Glory ..., A most perfect unity in Three Hypostasis, a supreme Godhead, O

                and One Kingdom, save us all.
                Now & ever ..., Theotokion: The wonder of thy conceiving is beyond
                speech, O Mother and Virgin: for how didst thou give birth and yet remain
                undefiled? How dost thou bear a child, without knowing a man? This news is
                new and wonderful to me, how, surpassing nature, the Word of God was born
                of thee.

                Verse: May Thou judge me also, to hear Thy words: “Come hither”.
                On this day, Soul Saturday, according to the order instituted by our Holy
                Fathers, we call to remembrance all those who have died from the beginning of
                the ages in faith and in the hope of the resurrection and of life eternal. The
                present commemoration of the dead is based on the reality that many of our
                fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters died under such circumstances that
                funeral prayers and normal memorial services could not be offered for them.
                Either in a foreign land or on the seas, on impassable mountains or in gulfs or
                precipices, through starvation or diseases, in wars, in fires, or during
                earthquakes, and in so many other ways, perhaps in poverty or in need, our
                known and unknown brothers and sisters in Christ did not enjoy the chanting
                and necessary spiritual care. Therefore, our Holy Fathers, moved by their love
                for humanity, appointed the present celebration to take place in the Church
                everywhere, having received this from the Holy Apostles, so that all who have
                died through various mishaps or accidents may be remembered together, for
                the benefit of their souls. There is great profit to the soul from these memorials
                in the Church. This is the first reason. The second reason is that since the Holy
                Fathers were going to place the memory of Christ’s Second Coming on the
                following day, Sunday, they appropriately commemorate the souls today, as it
                were, propitiating the fearful Judge, who cannot be deceived, to apply His usual
                compassion and to appoint them to the promised delight. Furthermore, the
                Sunday following tomorrow is dedicated to Adam’s exile from Paradise, after
                which a new life is considered to begin for ourselves. Before this new
                beginning, the present memorial service has as its purpose to warn and frighten
                the living, so that they may meditate on their own death and proceed more
                diligently in the spiritual struggles of Great Lent. After their falling asleep, the
                Judgment shall follow by the Judge who cannot be bribed. We always remember
                the souls of the dead on the Sabbath, for the Sabbath (Saturday) is the day of
                rest. In Hebrew, Sabbath literally means “rest.” As the Jews have this day for
                their repose and paused from every work and professional dealing, we
                Christians have it to remember the repose of our those who preceded us. On
                this day, we hold memorial services and have koliva blessed in the church, give
                alms, and perform various works of mercy. All these practices are of great
                benefit to the departed souls. Since the Orthodox Church does not celebrate
                Divine Liturgies on weekdays during Great Lent where the dead can be
                commemorated, the second, third, and fourth Saturdays of the Fast are
                designated as Soul Saturdays. There are many proofs that the souls of the
                departed can be greatly benefited by what is done in their behalf. St. Marcarios
                the Egyptian once saw the dry skull of a pagan by the road on his way, and
                asked, saying, “Do you ever have any kind of consolation in Hades?” And the
                skull answered, “Yes, Father, especially when you pray for the sake of the dead;
                abundant is the comfort which we then enjoy.” The great man became very
                happy, because he always prayed for the dead and wished to be assured of the
                results of his intercessions. Another saint, Gregory the Dialogist, saved the
                Roman Emperor Trajan through his prayers, although he heard from God
                never to pray like that on be half of an impious non Christian again. Also
                Theodora the Empress, by the prayers of the holy men and confessors, saved
                her husband, the iconoclast Emperor Theophilos abhorred by God, from the
                everlasting torments. In his funeral oration to his brother Caesarios, St. Gregory
                the Theologian recommends alms on behalf of the reposed as being good. And
                the great Chrysostom in his commentary on Philippians says, “Let us think of
                ways to benefit the departed. Let us give them what help we can, namely
                almsgiving and offerings. For truly this brings them great advantage and very
                much gain and benefit. The custom of the priest commemorating those reposed
                in faith over the awesome Mysteries has not been without purpose nor
                arbitrarily ordained and delivered to God’s Church by His all-wise Disciples.”
                Again, “In making arrangements when you dispose of your property, together
                with your children and relatives, let your will also include the name of your
                Judge as a joint heir, and let not the mention of the poor be absent. St.
                Athanasius the Great also says that even if one has died and dissolved into the
                air, do not decline to provide oil and candles at the grave and to plead with
                Christ our God, for they are acceptable to God and bring great recompense: if
                the deceased was a sinner, that you may lose his sins; if righteous, that it may
                add to his reward. If one is a stranger without means, having no one to take
                care of these matters, God, being righteous and compassionate, will
                proportionately measure out to him His mercy, as He knows best. Moreover, he
                who offers such services to the dead also partakes of the reward, because he has
                shown love and concern for the salvation of his neighbor. It is as when one
                anoints a friend with perfumes, he receives the sweet aroma first. As for those
                who do not fulfill the wills and testaments of the deceased concerning these
                matters, they will positively be condemned. Until Christ’s Second Coming,
                whatever is done for the souls of the dead is beneficial, as the Fathers say,
                particularly to those who had done some small good deeds when they were
                among the living. Even if the divine Scriptures declare certain things as needed
                for the chastening of the majority, yet as a rule God’s love for man prevails. For
                if the balance of good and shameful deeds is even, God’s love for man prevails.
                If the scale is weighed down a little by evil deeds, again His exceeding goodness
                prevails. In the other life, everyone will be acquainted even with those whom
                they have never seen before, as the divine Chrysostom says, deducing this from
                the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. All will recognize each other, but not
                from any bodily characteristics. For all shall be one age, and traits from birth
                will be absent. Rather, we shall recognize each other through the soul’s spiritual
                eyes, as St. Gregory the Theologian says in his funeral oration to Caesarios:
                “Then I shall see Caesarios, beaming with joy and glorious, such as you have
                often appeared to me in my dreams, O most beloved of brothers.” St.
                Athanasios the Great also says in his homily on the dead that until the time of
                the universal resurrection it has been granted to the saints to recognize each
                other and revel together, while the sinners, on the other hand, have been
                deprived even of this. Regarding the holy martyrs, they are capable of observing
                our actions and even of visiting us. Then all shall know one another when the
                hidden secrets of every man shall be revealed. We should know that, for the
                time being, the souls of the righteous dwell in certain places set aside for them,
                and the souls of the sinners in their own location. The former rejoice in their
                hope, but the latter grieve in expectation of future suffering. Therefore, the
                saints have not yet received the promised blessings, according to the words of
                the Holy Apostle Paul, who says, “God having provided something better for
                us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us” (Heb. 11:40). We
                should also know that not all who have suffered death by various accidents
                (falling down from precipices, being burned in fires, being sunk in seas, or
                perishing by starvation, poison, frost, and so on) have had such an end as a
                result of God’s command. For these are God’s judgments: some occur with His
                approval, others by His permission. Still others occur as a warning, a threat, or a
                chastisement. By foreknowledge He knows and is aware of everything, and
                everything occurs by His will, as with the sparrows about which the Holy
                Gospel speaks. He does not order that, for example, one man is to die by
                drowning and another to die normally, one as an old man and the other as an
                infant. But once and for all He determined, with some exceptions, the general
                times and various kinds of death in man. Within these constraints do the
                various means of death occur, without God’s determining them precisely from
                the beginning, only knowing. But in relation to the life of each and every
                person, God’s will plans the time and the manner of each one’s death. St. Basil
                the Great speaks about the limits of man’s life, although he is alluding to God’s
                words, “For dust you are, and to dust you shall return” (Gen. 3:19). St. Paul also
                writes to the Corinthians, “For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner
                eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. For this
                reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep” (1 Cor. 11:29).
                Here the word sleep refers to death. The Holy Prophet David says, “Do not
                take me away in the midst of my days. Your years are throughout all
                generations”(Ps. 101:25). Again, “You have made my days a few spans, and my
                existence is nothing in your sight” (Ps. 38:6). The Holy King Solomon says,
                “son, honor your father, that you may live many years, and not die before your
                time” (Eccles 3:5 - 6). And the Lord himself, speaking to Eliphaz the Temanite,
                says, “For I will accept him, lest I deal with you according to your folly; because
                you have not spoken of Me what is right, as my servant Job has” (Job 42:8).
                Hence it is evident that there is no set term of life. Or, if there is one, it is
                whatever God wills. For as He so wishes He adds to or deletes from the time of
                the life of this or that individual, administering all things for our benefit. And
                when He so wills, God arranges both the place and the time of repose.
                According to St. Athanasios the Great, the term of each person’s life is set by
                the will and counsel of God: “Through the depths of Thy judgments shalt Thou
                care for all, O Christ.” According to St. Basil the Great, death comes as soon as
                the term of life has been fulfilled; by the words term of life, God’s will is meant.
                For if the term of life had already been determined, then for what do we need
                God, or even a physician? And why do we pray for our children? One ought to
                know that baptized infants who die shall enjoy the bliss of Paradise; those not
                baptized and those of the heathen shall go neither to the place of bliss nor to
                Hades. When the soul has left the body, it no longer has any concern for earthly
                things but is continually concerned with matters in the next life. We celebrate
                the first memorial service on the third day after death, because by the third day
                the dead one’s appearance is altered. We serve the second memorial service on
                the ninth day after death, because by this day the entire body is dissolved,
                except for the heart. We serve the third memorial service on the fortieth day,
                for by this day the heart has deteriorated. The same progression, in reverse
                order, is made at birth: by the third day after conception the heart is formed; by
                the ninth day the flesh is fashioned, and by the fortieth day the full form
                appears.
                O Master Christ, set the souls of Your departed servants in the tabernacles
                of Your righteous, and have mercy upon us and save us,
                as You are the only Immortal One. Amen

                Brethren: All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all
                things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. Let no man seek his own, but
                every man another’s wealth. Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking
                no question for conscience sake: For the earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness
                thereof. If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to
                go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
                But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for
                his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord’s, and
                the fullness thereof:
                1st EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS (4:13-17)
                Brethren: I would not have you to be ignorant, concerning them which are
                asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe
                that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God
                bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
                which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them
                which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
                with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in
                Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
                together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we
                ever be with the Lord.
                THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE (21 : 8-9, 25-27, 33-36)
                The Lord spake unto His disciples saying: Take heed that ye be not
                deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time
                draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. But when ye shall hear of wars
                and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but
                the end is not by and by. And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon,
                and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea
                and the waves roaring; Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after
                those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be
                shaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power
                and great glory. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
                away. And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged
                with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come
                upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the
                face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be
                accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand
                before the Son of man.
                THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. JOHN (5: 24-30)
                The Lord spake unto the Jews who came unto Him, saying: Verily, verily, I
                say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath
                everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death
                unto life. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when
                the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
                For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in
                himself; And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is
                the Son of man. Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that
                are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done
                good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
                resurrection of damnation. I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge:
                and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the
                Father which hath sent me.
