<h3>Psalm 37</h3>
A psalm of David . For remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day
PUT me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy heavy
displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me: and thy hand presseth me sore.
There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure: neither is there any
rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.
For my wickednesses are gone over my head: and are like a sore burden, too
heavy for me to bear.
My wounds stink, and are corrupt: through my foolishness.
I am brought into so great trouble and misery: that I go mourning all the day
long.
For my loins are filled with a sore disease: and there is no whole part in my body.
I am feeble, and sore smitten: I have roared for the very disquietness of my
heart.
Lord, thou knowest all my desire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me: and the sight of mine eyes is gone
from me.
My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble: and my
kinsmen stood afar off.
They also that sought after my life laid snares for me: and they that went about
to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit all the day long.
As for me I was like a deaf men, and heard not: and as one that is dumb, who
doth not open his mouth.
I became even as a man that heareth not: and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my
God.
I have required that they, even mine enemies should not triumph over me: for
when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me.
And I, truly, am set in the plague: and my heaviness is ever in my sight.
For I will confess my wickedness: and be sorry for my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are mighty: and they that hate me wrongfully are
many in number.
They also that reward evil for good are against me: because I follow the thing
that good is.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me.
Haste thee to help me: O Lord God of my salvation.
<h3>Psalm 38</h3>
For the end. A song of David, for Idithun
I SAID, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not in my tongue.
I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle: while the ungodly is in my sight.
I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even from good words;
but it was pain and grief to me.
My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire kindled: and at
the last I spake with my tongue;
Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may be certified
how long I have to live.
Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long: and mine age is even as
nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is altogether vanity.
For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth
up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.
And now, Lord, what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.
Deliver me from all mine offences: and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.
I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.
Take thy plague away from me: I am even consumed by the means of thy heavy
hand.
When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to
consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man
therefore is but vanity.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling: hold not thy
peace at my tears.
For I am a stranger with thee: and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence, and be no
more seen
<h3>Psalm 39</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
I WAITED patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and heard my calling.
He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay: and set my
feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth: even a thanksgiving unto our God.
Many shall see it, and fear: and shall put their trust in the Lord.
Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the Lord: and turned not unto the
proud, and to such as go about with lies.
O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like as be
also thy thoughts which are to us-ward: and yet there is no man that
ordereth them unto thee:
If I should declare them, and speak of them: they should be more than I am able
to express.
Sacrifice and meat-offering thou wouldest not: but mine ears hast thou opened.
Burnt-offerings, and sacrifice for sin, hast thou not required: then said I, Lo, I
come,
In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil thy will, O my
God: I am content to do it; yea, thy law is within my heart.
I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I will not refrain
my lips, O Lord, and that thou knowest.
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart: my talk hath been of thy truth
and of thy salvation.
I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth: from the great congregation.
Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord: let thy loving-kindness and thy
truth alway preserve me.
For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such hold upon
me that I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the
hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.
O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me: make haste, O Lord, to help me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after my soul to
destroy it: let them be driven backward and put to rebuke, that wish me
evil.
Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame: that say unto me, Fie upon
thee, fie upon thee.
Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let such as love thy
salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and needy: but the Lord careth for me.
Thou art my helper and redeemer: make no long tarrying, O my God.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 40</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him
in the time of trouble.
The Lord preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth:
and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.
The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick upon his bed: make thou all his bed in
his sickness.
I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies speak evil of me: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: and his heart conceiveth falsehood
within himself, and when he cometh forth he telleth it.
All mine enemies whisper together against me: even against me do they imagine
this evil.
Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him: and now that he lieth, let him
rise up no more.
Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted: who did also eat of my
bread, hath laid great wait for me.
But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord: raise thou me up again, and I shall reward
them.
By this I know thou favourest me: that mine enemy doth not triumph against me.
And when I am in my health, thou upholdest me: and shalt set me before thy face
for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: world without end. Amen.
<h3>Psalm 41</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: when shall I come to
appear before the presence of God?
My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where
is now thy God?
Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the
multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;
In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day.
Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted
within me?
Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his
countenance.
My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore will I remember thee concerning
the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermon.
One deep calleth another, because of the noise of the water-pipes: all thy waves
and storms are gone over me.
The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time: and in the nightseason did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me: why go I
thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword: while mine enemies that trouble
me cast me in the teeth;
Namely, while they say daily unto me: Where is now thy God?
Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.
<h3>Psalm 42</h3>
A psalm of David
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people:
O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.
For thou art the God of my strength, why hast thou put me from thee: and why
go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me: and bring me unto thy
holy hill, and to thy dwelling.
And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and
gladness: and upon the harp I will give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.

<h3>Psalm 43</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
WE HAVE heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us: what thou hast
done in their time of old;
How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted them in: how
thou hast destroyed the nations and cast them out.
For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword: neither was it
their own arm that helped them;
But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance: because
thou hadst a favour unto them.
Thou art my King, O God: send help unto Jacob.
Through thee will we overthrow our enemies: and in thy Name will we tread
them under, that rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow: it is not my sword that shall help me;
But it is thou that savest us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion that
hate us.
We make our boast of God all day long: and will praise thy Name for ever.
But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion: and goest not forth with our
armies.
Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies: so that they which hate us
spoil our goods.
Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep: and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Thou sellest thy people for nought: and takest no money for them.
Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours: to be laughed to scorn, and had
in derision of them that are round about us.
Thou makest us to be a by-word among the heathen: and that the people shake
their heads at us.
My confusion is daily before me: and the shame of my face hath covered me;
For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer: for the enemy and avenger.
And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee: nor behave
ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.
Our heart is not turned back: neither our steps gone out of thy way;
No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons: and covered us with
the shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to any
strange God: shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very secrets of
the heart.
For thy sake also are we killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep
appointed to be slain.
Up, Lord, why sleepest thou: awake, and be not absent from us for ever.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face: and forgettest our misery and trouble?
For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
ground.
Arise, and help us: and deliver us for thy mercy's sake.
<h3>Psalm 44</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses by the sons of Core, for instruction. A Song concerning the
beloved
MY HEART is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the thing which I have made
unto the King.
My tongue is the pen: of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, because God
hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most Mighty: according to thy
worship and renown.
Good luck have thou with thine honour: ride on, because of the word of truth , of
meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible
things.
Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be subdued unto thee: even in
the midst among the King's enemies.
Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, even thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia: out of the ivory palaces,
whereby they have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did
stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, incline thine ear ; forget also thine own
people, and thy father's house.
So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty: for his is thy Lord God, and
worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: like as the rich also among
the people shall make their supplication before thee.
The King's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work: the virgins that be
her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee.
With joy and gladness shall they be brought: and shall enter into the King's
palace.
Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children: whom thou mayest make princes
in all lands.
I will remember thy Name from one generation to another: therefore shall the
people give thanks unto thee, world without end.
<h3>Psalm 45</h3>
For the end. For the sons of Core; a psalm concerning secret things
GOD is our hope and strength: a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved: and though the hills be
carried into the midst of the sea;
Though the waters thereof rage and swell: and though the mountains shake at
the tempest of the same.
The rivers of the flood thereof shall make glad the city of God: the holy place of
the tabernacle of the most Highest.
God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed: God shall help
her, and that right early.
The heathen make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved: but God hath shewed
his voice, and the earth shall melt away.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.
O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord: what destruction he hath
brought upon the earth.
He maketh wars to cease in all the world: he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the
spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.
Be still then, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I
will be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

<h3>Psalm 46</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O CLAP your hand together, all ye people: O sing unto God with the voice of
melody.
For the Lord is high, and to be feared: he is the great King upon all the earth.
He shall subdue the people under us: and the nations under our feet.
He shall choose out an heritage for us: even the worship of Jacob, whom he
loved.
God is gone up with a merry noise: and the Lord with the sound of the trump.
O sing praises, sing praises unto our God: O sing praises, sing praises unto our
King.
For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon his holy seat.
The princes of the people are joined unto the people of the God of Abraham: for
God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the earth, as it were with a
shield.
<h3>Psalm 47</h3>
A psalm of praise for the sons of Core on the second day of the week
GREAT is the Lord, and highly to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his
holy hill.
The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth: upon the north-side
lieth the city of the great King; God is well known in her palaces as a sure
refuge.
For lo, the kings of the earth: are gathered, and gone by together.
They marvelled to see such things: they were astonished, and suddenly cast
down.
Fear came there upon them, and sorrow: as upon a woman in her travail.
Thou shalt break the ships of the sea: through the east wind.
Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the
city of our God: God upholdeth the same for ever.
We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God: in the midst of thy temple.
O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's end: thy right
hand is full of righteousness.
Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad: because of thy
judgements.
Walk about Sion, and go round about her: and tell the towers thereof.
Mark well her bulwarks, set up her houses: that ye may tell them that come
after.
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he shall be our guide unto death.
<h3>Psalm 48</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O HEAR ye this, all ye people: ponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the
world;
High and low, rich and poor: one with another.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom: and my heart shall muse of understanding.
I will incline mine ear to the parable: and shew my dark speech upon the harp.
Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness: and when the wickedness of
my heels compasseth me round about?
There be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches.
But no man may deliver his brother: nor make agreement unto God for him;
For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that alone for ever;
Yea, though he live long: and see not the grave.
For he seeth that wise men also die, and perish together: as well as the ignorant
and foolish, and leave their riches for other.
And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever: and that their
dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the
lands after their own names.
Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour: seeing that he may be compared
unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them.
This is their foolishness: and their posterity praise their saying.
They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and the righteous shall
have domination over them in the morning: their beauty shall consume in
the sepulchre out of their dwelling.
But God hath delivered my soul from the place of hell: for he shall receive me.
Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich: or if the glory of his house be
increased.
For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth: neither shall his pomp
follow him.
For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man: and so long as thou doest
well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.
He shall follow the generation of his fathers: and shall never see light.
Man being in honour hath no understanding: but is compared unto the beasts
that perish.

<h3>Psalm 49</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
THE Lord, even the most mighty God, hath spoken: and called the world, from
the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Out of Sion hath God appeared: in perfect beauty.
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: there shall go before him a
consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up round about him.
He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth, that he may judge his people.
Gather my saints together unto me: those that have made a covenant with me
with sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is Judge himself.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak: I myself will testify against thee, O Israel;
for I am God, even thy God.
I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt-offerings:
because they were not alway before me.
I will take no bullock out of thine house: nor he-goat out of thy folds.
For all the beasts of the forest are mine: and so are the cattle upon a thousand
hills.
I know all the fowls upon the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are in
my sight.
If I be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the whole world is mine, and all that is
therein.
Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh: and drink the blood of goats?
Offer unto God thanksgiving: and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.
And call upon me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise
me.
But unto the ungodly said God: Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my
covenant in thy mouth;
Whereas thou hatest to be reformed: and has cast my words behind thee?
When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him: and hast been partaker
with the adulterers.
Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness: and with thy tongue thou hast set
forth deceit.
Thou satest, and spakest against thy brother: yea, and hast slandered thine own
mother's son.
These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest
wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and
set before thee the things that thou hast done.
O consider this, ye that forget God: lest I pluck you away, and there be none to
deliver you.
Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation right will I shew the salvation of God.
<h3>Psalm 50</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to
Bathsheba
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according to the
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.
Wash me throughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.
Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin hath my mother conceived me.
But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand
wisdom secretly.
Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice.
Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.
Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health: and
my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.
Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy praise.
For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou delightest not in
burnt-offerings.
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt
thou not despise.
O be favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burntofferings and oblations: then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine
altar.

<h3>Psalm 51</h3>
For the end. A psalm of instruction by David, when Doeg the Idumean came and told Saul that
David had gone to the house of Abimelech
WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant: that thou canst do mischief;
Whereas the goodness of God: endureth yet daily?
Thy tongue imagineth wickedness: and with lies thou cuttest like a sharp rasor.
Thou hast loved unrighteousness more then goodness: and to talk of lies more
than righteousness.
Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt: O thou false tongue.
Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever: he shall take thee, and pluck thee out
of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of the living.
The righteous also shall see this, and fear: and shall laugh him to scorn;
Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength: but trusted unto the
multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: my trust is in the
tender mercy of God for ever and ever.
I will always give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done: and I will hope in thy
Name, for thy saints like it well.
<h3>Psalm 52</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David upon Maeleth, of instruction
THE foolish body hath said in his heart: There is no God.
Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness: there is none that
doeth good.
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there were any
that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is also none that doeth good, no not one.
Are not they without understanding, that work wickedness: eating up my people
as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.
They were afraid where no fear was: for God hath broken the bones of him that
besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because God hath despised
them.
O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion: O that the Lord would
deliver his people out of captivity!
Then should Jacob rejoice: and Israel should be right glad.
<h3>Psalm 53</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of instruction by David. When the Ziphites came and said to Saul,
Lo, is not David hid with us?
SAVE me, O God, for thy Name's sake: and avenge me in thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God: and hearken unto the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me: and tyrants, which have not God before
their eyes, seek after my soul.
Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy truth.
An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O Lord: because
it is so comfortable.
For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire
upon mine enemies.
<h3>Psalm 54</h3>
For the end. Among hymns of instruction by David
HEAR my prayer, O God: and hide not thyself from my petition.
Take heed unto me, and hear me: how I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed.
The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast: for they are minded to
do me some mischief; so maliciously are they set against me.
My heart is disquieted within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me: and an horrible dread hath
overwhelmed me.
And I said, O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I flee away, and be at
rest.
Lo, then would I get me away far off: and remain in the wilderness.
I would make haste to escape: because of the stormy wind and tempest.
Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them: for I have spied unrighteousness
and strife in the city.
Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow
are in the midst of it.
Wickedness is therein: deceit and guile go not out of their streets.
For it is not an open enemy, that hath done me this dishonour: for then I could
have borne it.
Neither was it mine adversary, that did magnify himself against me: for then
peradventure I would have hid myself from him.
But it was even thou, my companion: my guide, and mine own familiar friend.
We took sweet counsel together: and walked in the house of God as friends.
Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for
wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord shall save me.
In the evening, and morning, and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly: and
he shall hear my voice.
It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
for there were many with me.
Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them down: for
they will not turn, nor fear God.
He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him: and he brake his covenant.
The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart: his
words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very swords.
O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: and shall not suffer
the righteous to fall for ever.
And as for them: thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction.
The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days:
nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.

<h3>Psalm 55</h3>
For the end. Concerning the people that were removed from the sanctuary. By David for a
memorial, when the Philistines caught him in Gath
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me: he is daily
fighting, and troubling me.
Mine enemies are daily in hand to swallow me up: for they be many that fight
against me, O thou most Highest.
Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid: yet put I my trust in thee.
I will praise God, because of his word: I have put my trust in God, and will not
fear what flesh can do unto me.
They daily mistake my words: all that they imagine is to do me evil.
They hold all together, and keep themselves close: and mark my steps, when
they lay wait for my soul.
Shall they escape for their wickedness: thou, O God, in thy displeasure shalt cast
them down.
Thou tellest my flittings; put my tears into thy bottle: are not these things noted
in thy book?
Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight: this I
know; for God is on my side.
In God's word I will rejoice: in the Lord's word will I comfort me.
Yea, in God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows: unto thee will I give thanks.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling: that I may
walk before God in the light of the living.
<h3>Psalm 56</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David, for a memorial. When he fled from the presence of Saul to
the cave
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, be merciful unto me, for my soul trusteth in
thee: and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until this
tyranny be over-past.
I will call unto the most high God: even unto the God that shall perform the
cause which I have in hand.
He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him that would eat
me up.
God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among lions.
And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are
spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they have digged a
pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, and give praise.
Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee
among the nations.
For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens: and thy truth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 57</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation: and do ye judge the
thing that is right, O ye sons of men?
Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth: and your hands deal with
wickedness.
The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb: as soon as they are
born, they go astray, and speak lies.
They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent: even like the deaf adder that
stoppeth her ears.
Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer: charm he never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; smite the jaw-bones of the lions, O
Lord: let them fall away like water that runneth apace; and when they
shoot their arrows let them be rooted out.
Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of a woman:
and let them not see the sun.
Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns: so let indignation vex him, even as a
thing that is raw.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his
footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: doubtless
there is a God that judgeth the earth.

<h3>Psalm 58</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David for a memorial, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill
him
DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God: defend me from them that rise up
against me.
O deliver me from the wicked doers: and save me from the blood-thirsty men.
For lo, they lie waiting for my soul: the mighty men are gathered against me,
without any offence or fault of me, O Lord.
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: arise thou therefore to help
me, and behold.
Stand up, O Lord God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the heathen: and be
not merciful unto them that offend of malicious wickedness.
They go to and fro in the evening: they grin like a dog, and run about through the
city.
Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips: for who doth
hear?
But thou. O Lord, shalt have them in derision: and thou shalt laugh all the
heathen to scorn.
My strength will I ascribe unto thee: for thou art the God of my refuge.
God sheweth me his goodness plenteously: and God shall let me see my desire
upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget it: but scatter them abroad among the
people, and put them down, O Lord, our defence.
For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be taken in
their pride: and why? their preaching is of cursing and lies.
Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish: and know that
it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.
And in the evening they will return: grin like a dog, and will go about the city.
They will run here and there for meat: and grudge if they be not satisfied.
As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betimes in the
morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
trouble.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my
merciful God.
<h3>Psalm 59</h3>
For the end. For them that shall yet be changed. For an inscription by David for instruction.
When he had burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syrian Sobal, and Joab had returned and smitten
twelve thousand in the Valley of Salt
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad: thou hast also been
displeased; O turn thee unto us again.
Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: heal the sores thereof, for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewed thy people heavy things: thou hast given us a drink of deadly
wine.
Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee: that they may triumph because of
the truth.
Therefore were thy beloved delivered: help me with thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Sichem: and mete out
the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head;
Judah is my law-giver.
Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, be thou glad
of me.
Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou cast us out, O God: wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
O be thou our help in trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Through God will we do great acts: for it is he that shall tread down our enemies.
<h3>Psalm 60</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of David
HEAR my crying, O God: give ear unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth will I call unto thee: when my heart is in heaviness.
O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I: for thou hast been my hope, and
a strong tower for me against the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: and my trust shall be under the covering of
thy wings.
For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires: and hast given an heritage unto those
that fear thy Name.
Thou shalt grant the King a long life: that his years may endure throughout all
generations.
He shall dwell before God for ever: O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness,
that they may preserve him.
So will I always sing praise unto thy Name: that I may daily perform my vows.

<h3>Psalm 61</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David for Idithun
MY SOUL truly waiteth still upon God: for of him cometh my salvation.
He verily is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
greatly fall.
How long will ye imagine mischief against every man: ye shall be slain all the
sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and like a broken hedge.
Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt: their delight is in
lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse with their heart.
Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God: for my hope is in him.
He truly is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
fall.
In God is my health, and my glory: the rock of my might, and in God is my trust.
O put your trust in him alway, ye people: pour out your hearts before him, for
God is our hope.
As for the children of men, they are but vanity: the children of men are deceitful
upon the weights, they are altogether lighter than vanity itself.
O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselves unto vanity: if riches
increase, set not your heart upon them.
God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same: that power belongeth
unto God;
And that thou, Lord, art merciful: for thou rewardest every man according to his
work.
<h3>Psalm 62</h3>
A psalm of David. When he was in the wilderness of Idumea
O GOD, thou art my God: early will I seek thee.
My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee: in a barren and dry
land where no water is.
Thus have I looked for thee in holiness: that I might behold thy power and glory.
For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: my lips shall praise thee.
As long as I live will I magnify thee on this manner: and lift up my hands in thy
Name.
My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness: when my
mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.
Have I not remembered thee in my bed: and thought upon thee when I was
waking?
Because thou hast been my helper: therefore under the shadow of thy wings will
I rejoice.
My soul hangeth upon thee: thy right hand hath upholden me.
These also that seek the hurt of my soul: they shall go under the earth.
Let them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be a portion for foxes.
But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him shall be
commended: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
<h3>Psalm 63</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the gathering together of the froward: and from the insurrection of
wicked doers;
Who have whet their tongue like a sword: and shoot out their arrows, even bitter
words;
That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: suddenly do they hit him, and
fear not.
They encourage themselves in mischief: and commune among themselves how
they may lay snares, and say that no man shall see them.
They imagine wickedness, and practise it: that they keep secret among
themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.
But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow: that they shall be
wounded.
Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall insomuch that whoso seeth them
shall laugh them to scorn.
And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done: for they shall perceive that
it is his work.
The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and put his trust in him: and all they that
are true of heart shall be glad.

<h3>Psalm 64</h3>
For the end. A psalm and song of David
THOU, O God, art praised in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed in
Jerusalem.
Thou that hearest the prayer: unto thee shall all flesh come.
My misdeeds prevail against me: O be thou merciful unto our sins.
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: he shall dwell
in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house, even of
thy holy temple.
Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation: thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that remain in the broad sea.
Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains: and is girded about with power.
Who stilleth the raging of the sea: and the noise of his waves, and the madness of
the people.
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afraid at thy
tokens: thou that makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
praise thee.
Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very plenteous.
The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest
for the earth.
Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof: thou
makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop fatness.
They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and the little hills shall
rejoice on every side.
The folds shall be full of sheep: the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn,
that they shall laugh and sing.
<h3>Psalm 65</h3>
For the end. A song of a plasm of resurrection
O BE joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of his Name, make
his praise to be glorious.
Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the greatness of
thy power shall thine enemies be found liars unto thee.
For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy Name.
O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is in his doing
toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the water on foot;
there did we rejoice thereof.
He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people: and such as will
not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.
O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to slip.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our loins.
Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water, and
thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay thee my vows, which I
promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of rams: I will offer
bullocks and goats.
O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what he hath
done for my soul.
I called unto him with my mouth: and gave him praises with my tongue.
If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart: the Lord will not hear me.
But God hath heard me: and considered the voice of my prayer.
Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned his mercy from me.
<h3>Psalm 66</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns
GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his countenance,
and be merciful unto us:
That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the folk righteously,
and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God, shall
give us his blessing.
God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 67</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song of David
LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee
before him.
Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away: and like as wax
melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the presence of God.
But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them also be merry and
joyful .
O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name: magnify him that rideth upon
the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise him in his Name JAH, and
rejoice before him.
He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows: even God
in his holy habitation.
He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the
prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates continue in scarceness.
O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through
the wilderness;
The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God: even as Sinai
also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.
Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreshedst it
when it was weary.
Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness
prepared for the poor.
The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers.
Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited: and they of the household
divided the spoil.
Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove: that
is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.
When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake: then were they as white as
snow in Salmon.
As the hill of Basan, so is God's hill: even an high hill, as the hill of Basan.
Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which it pleaseth him to
dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: and the Lord
is among them, as in the holy place of Sinai.
Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for
men: yea, even for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among
them.
Praised be the Lord daily: even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his benefits
upon us.
He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is the Lord, by
whom we escape death.
God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalp of such a one as
goeth on still in his wickedness.
The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan: mine own
will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the tongue of
thy dogs may be red through the same.
It is well seen, O God, how thou goest: how thou, my God and King, goest in the
sanctuary.
The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the damsels
playing with the timbrels.
Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations: from the ground
of the heart.
There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their counsel: the
princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.
Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing, O God, that thou
hast wrought in us,
For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem: so shall kings bring presents unto thee.
When the company of the spear-men, and multitude of the mighty are scattered
abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they humbly bring pieces of
silver: and when he hath scattered the people that delight in war;
Then shall the princes come out of Eqypt: the Morians' land shall soon stretch
our her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord;
Who sitteth in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he doth send out his
voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.
Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel: his worship and strength is in the
clouds.
O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: even the God of Israel, he will give
strength and power unto his people; blessed be God.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 68</h3>
For the end. A Psalm of David for alternate verses
SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.
I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is: I am come into deep waters, so
that the floods run over me.
I am weary of crying; my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for waiting so long
upon my God.
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that
are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.
I paid them the things that I never took: God, thou knowest my simpleness, and
my faults are not hid from thee.
Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my cause:
let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of
Israel.
And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof: shame hath covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an alien unto my mother's
children.
For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me: and the rebukes of them that
rebuked thee are fallen upon me.
I wept, and chastened myself with fasting: and that was turned to my reproof.
I put on sackcloth also: and they jested upon me.
They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs upon
me.
But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.
Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the truth of thy salvation.
Take me out of the mire, that I sink not: O let me be delivered from them that
hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up: and let
not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable: turn thee unto me
according to the multitude of thy mercies.
And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: O haste thee, and
hear me.
Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: O deliver me, because of mine enemies.
Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are
all in thy sight.
Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to
have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.
They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and let the things that
should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.
Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not: and ever bow thou down their backs.
Pour out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold
of them.
Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they talk how they may vex
them whom thou hast wounded.
Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and not come into thy
righteousness.
Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be written among the
righteous.
As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God, shall lift me up.
I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with thanksgiving.
This also shall please the Lord: better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God, and your soul
shall live.
For the Lord heareth the poor: and despiseth not his prisoners.
Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea, and all that moveth therein.
For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah: that men may dwell there,
and have it in possession.
The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his Name
shall dwell therein.
<h3>Psalm 69</h3>
For the end. By David for a remembrance; that the Lord may save me
HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned
backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.
Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame: that cry over me, There,
there.
But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let all such as
delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and in misery: haste thee unto me, O God.
Thou art my helper and my redeemer: O Lord, make no long tarrying.

        <h3>The Reading from the Book of Exodus (20:12-18).</h3><p>The Lord said unto Moses: Come up to Me into the mount and be there; and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written that thou mayest teach them. And Moses and his minister Joshua rose up and went up into the mount of God, and Moses said unto the elders: Tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you; and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. And the glory of the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And the seventh day the Lord called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. And Moses went into the midst of the cloud and gat him up into the mount; and was in the mount forty days and forty nights.</p><h3>The Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy. (4:1,6-15).</h3><p> Moses said unto the people: Now hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them, that ye may live. Keep therefore and do them;3 for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of thenations, which shall hear all these statutes and say: surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon Him for. And now take heed to yourselves, all ye the house of Israel, and keep your souls diligently, lest ye forget the things which your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your hearts all the days of your life. But teach them your sons and your sons' sons, specially the day that ye stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me: Gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children. .And ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds and thick darkness. And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude, only ye heard a voice. And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform. Aid the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that ye might do them in the land. The Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.</p><h3>The Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy (5:1-7,9,10,23-26,28; 6:1,2,4,5,13,18).</h3><p>Moses called all Israel, and said unto them: Hear, O Israel the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them and keep and do them: The Lord God made a covenant with you in Horeb, not with your fathers alone did the Lord make His covenant, but with you also. The Lord talked face to face in Horeb out of the midst of the fire, and I stood between the Lord and you at that time to declare unto you the words of the Lord saying: I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; there are no others gods beside Me, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments. And it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of fire, and the mountain did burn with fire, that ye all came near unto me,and ye said: Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed us His glory, and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God doth talk with man and he liveth. Now, why should we die? for this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die. For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the Lord speaking out of the midst of the fire, and liveth? And the Lord heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke unto me, and I said unto you all the commandments, the statutes and the judgments which the Lord commanded you that ye might fear all His statutes, that He may be merciful unto you and that ye may increase in the land. Hear, Israel, the Lord your God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy thought, with all thy heart, with all thy soul and with all thy might; thou shalt fear Him and serve Him alone, cleave unto Him, thou shalt swear by His name and shalt do that which is good in His sight, that it may be well with thee.

<h3>Psalm 70</h3>
By David. A psalm sung by the sons of Jonadab and the first that were taken captive
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: but rid
me and deliver me in thy righteousness, incline thine ear unto me, and save
me.
Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may alway resort: thou hast promised to
help me, for thou art my house of defence and my castle.
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the hand of the
unrighteous and cruel man.
For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope, even from
my youth.
Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: thou art he that took
me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall be always of thee.
I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is in thee.
O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy glory and honour
all the day long.
Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength faileth
me.
For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul take their
counsel together, saying: God hath forsaken him; persecute him, and take
him, for there is none to deliver him.
Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me.
Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul: let them be covered
with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.
As for me, I will patiently abide alway: and will praise thee more and more.
My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation: for I know no end
thereof.
I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy
righteousness only.
Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I tell of
thy wondrous works.
Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed: until I have
shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that
are yet for to come.
Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are they that thou hast
done; O God, who is like unto thee?
O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me, and yet didst thou
turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth
again.
Thou hast brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every side.
Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an
instrument of musick: unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Holy One
of Israel.
My lips will be fain when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul whom thou hast
delivered.
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are
confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.
<h3>Psalm 71</h3>
For Solomon
GIVE the King thy judgements, O God: and thy righteousness unto the King's
son.
Then shall he judge thy people according unto right: and defend the poor.
The mountains also shall bring peace: and the little hills righteousness unto the
people.
He shall keep the simple folk by their right: defend the children of the poor, and
punish the wrong-doer.
They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth: from one generation
to another.
He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool: even as the drops that
water the earth.
In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea, and abundance of peace, so long as
the moon endureth.
His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other: and from the flood unto
the world's end.
They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him: his enemies shall lick
the dust.
The kings of Tharsis and of the isles shall give presents: the kings of Arabia and
Saba shall bring gifts.
All kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do him service.
For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth: the needy also, and him that hath
no helper.
He shall be favourable to the simple and needy: and shall preserve the souls of
the poor.
He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong: and dear shall their blood
be in his sight.
He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia: prayer shall be
made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.
There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills: his fruit shall
shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city like grass upon the earth.
His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the
posterities: which shall be blessed through him; and all the heathen shall
praise him.
Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel: which only doeth wondrous
things;
And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: and all the earth shall be filled
with his majesty. Amen, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 72</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
TRULY God is loving unto Israel: even unto such as are of a clean heart.
Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone: my treadings had well-nigh slipt.
And why? I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such
prosperity.
For they are in no peril of death: but are lusty and strong.
They come in no misfortune like other folk: neither are they plagued like other
men.
And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride: and overwhelmed with
cruelty.
Their eyes swell with fatness: and they do even what they lust.
They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy: their talking is against the
most High.
For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their tongue goeth
through the world.
Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no small advantage.
Tush, say they, how should God perceive it: is there knowledge in the most High?
Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in
possession: and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed
mine hands in innocency.
All the day long have I been punished: and chastened every morning.
Yea, and I had almost said even as they: but lo, then I should have condemned
the generation of thy children.
Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me,
Until I went into the sanctuary of God: then understood I the end of these men;
Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places: and castest them down, and
destroyest them.
O how suddenly do they consume: perish, and come to a fearful end!
Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh: so shalt thou make their image to
vanish out of the city.
Thus my heart was grieved: and it went even through my reins.
So foolish was I, and ignorant: even as it were a beast before thee.
Nevertheless, I am alway by thee: for thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel: and after that receive me with glory.
Whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth that I desire in
comparison of thee.
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my
portion for ever.
For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that
commit fornication against thee.
But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord God: and
to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
<h3>Psalm 73</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot
against the sheep of thy pasture?
O think upon thy congregation: whom thou hast purchased and redeemed of old.
Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance: and mount Sion, wherein thou hast
dwelt.
Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy: which hath done
evil in thy sanctuary.
Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations: and set up their
banners for tokens.
He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees: was known to bring it to an
excellent work.
But now they break down all the carved work thereof: with axes and hammers.
They have set fire upon thy holy places: and have defiled the dwelling-place of
thy Name, even unto the ground.
Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether: thus have
they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.
We see not our tokens, there is not one prophet more: no, not one is there among
us, that understandeth any more.
O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour: how long shall the enemy
blaspheme thy Name, for ever?
Why withdrawest thou thy hand: why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy
bosom to consume the enemy?
For God is my King of old: the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself.
Thou didst divide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the
dragons in the waters.
Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces: and gavest him to be meat for the
people in the wilderness.
Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks: thou driedst up
mighty waters.
The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked: and how the foolish
people hath blasphemed thy Name.
O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the enemies: and
forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.
Look upon the covenant: for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel
habitations.
O let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the poor and needy give praise
unto thy Name.
Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
blasphemeth thee daily.
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the presumption of them that hate thee
increaseth ever more and more.

<h3>Psalm 74</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: A psalm of a song for Asaph
UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks: yea, unto thee do we give thanks.
Thy Name also is so nigh: and that do thy wondrous works declare.
When I receive the congregation: I shall judge according unto right.
The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the pillars of it.
I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly: and to the ungodly, Set not up your horn.
Set not up your horn on high: and speak not with a stiff neck.
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west: nor yet from the
south.
And why? God is the Judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixed,
and he poureth out of the same.
As for the dregs thereof: all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and suck
them out.
But I will talk of the God of Jacob: and praise him for ever.
All the horns of the ungodly also will I break: and the horns of the righteous shall
be exalted.
<h3>Psalm 75</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns, a psalm for Asaph: A song for the Assyrian
IN JEWRY is God known: his Name is great in Israel.
At Salem is his tabernacle: and his dwelling in Sion.
There brake he the arrows of the bow: the shield, the sword, and the battle.
Thou art of more honour and might: than the hills of the robbers.
The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep: and all the men whose hands
were mighty have found nothing.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob: both the chariot and horse are fallen.
Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when thou art
angry?
Thou didst cause thy judgement to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled,
and was still;
When God arose to judgement: and to help all the meek upon earth.
The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise: and the fierceness of them shalt
thou refrain.
Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that are round about him:
bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
He shall refrain the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among the kings of the
earth.
<h3>Psalm 76</h3>
For the end. For Idithun, a psalm of Asaph
I WILL cry unto God with my voice: even unto God will I cry with my voice, and
he shall hearken unto me.
In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran and ceased not in the
night-season ; my soul refused comfort.
When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God: when my heart is vexed, I will
complain.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble, that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old: and the years that are past.
I call to remembrance my song: and in the night I commune with mine own
heart, and search out my spirits.
Will the Lord absent himself for ever: and will he be no more intreated?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly to an end for
evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his loving-kindness in
displeasure?
And I said, It is mine own infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right
hand of the most Highest.
I will remember the works of the Lord: and call to mind thy wonders of old time.
I will think also of all thy works: and my talking shall be of thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is holy: who is so great a God as our God?
Thou art the God that doeth wonders: and hast declared thy power among the
people.
Thou hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid: the depths
also were troubled.
The clouds poured out water, the air thundered: and thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: the lightnings shone upon the
ground: the earth was moved, and shook withal.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and thy footsteps are
not known.
Thou leddest thy people like sheep: by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<h3>Psalm 77</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
HEAR my law, O my people: incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hard sentences of old;
Which we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told us;
That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to come: but
to shew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he
hath done.
He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law: which he commanded our
forefathers to teach their children;
That their posterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn;
To the intent that when they came up: they might shew their children the same;
That they might put their trust in God: and not to forget the works of God, but to
keep his commandments;
And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation: a
generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not
stedfastly unto God;
Like as the children of Ephraim: who being harnessed, and carrying bows,
turned themselves back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his law;
But forgat what he had done: and the wonderful works that he had shewed for
them.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt:
even in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea, and let them go through: he made the waters to stand on an
heap.
In the day-time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night through with a
light of fire.
He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness: and gave them drink thereof, as it had
been out of the great depth.
He brought waters out of the stony rock: so that it gushed out like the rivers.
Yet for all this they sinned more against him: and provoked the most Highest in
the wilderness.
They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their lust.
They spake against God also, saying: Shall God prepare a table in the
wilderness?
He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
flowed withal: but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?
When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and
there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;
Because they believed not in God: and put not their trust in his help.
So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.
He rained down manna also upon them for to eat: and gave them food from
heaven.
So man did eat angels' food: for he sent them meat enough.
He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven: and through his power he
brought in the south-west-wind.
He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand
of the sea.
He let it fall among their tents: even round about their habitation.
So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire: they were
not disappointed of their lust.
But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon
them, and slew the wealthiest of them: yea, and smote down the chosen
men that were in Israel.
But for all this they sinned yet more: and believed not his wondrous works.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years in trouble.
When he slew them, they sought him: and turned them early, and inquired after
God.
And they remembered that God was their strength: and that the high God was
their redeemer.
Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and dissembled with him
in their tongue.
For their heart was not whole with him: neither continued they stedfast in his
covenant.
But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds: and destroyed them not.
Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not suffer his whole
displeasure to arise.
For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were even a wind that
passeth away, and cometh not again.
Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness: and grieved him in the
desert.
They turned back, and tempted God: and moved the Holy One in Israel.
They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered them from the
hand of the enemy;
How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
He turned their waters into blood: so that they might not drink of the rivers.
He sent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to destroy them.
He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar: and their labour unto the grasshopper.
He destroyed their vines with hail-stones: and their mulberry-trees with the frost.
He smote their cattle also with hail-stones: and their flocks with hot
thunderbolts.
He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure and trouble:
and sent evil angels among them.
He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death: but gave
their life over to the pestilence;
And smote all the first-born in Egypt: the most principal and mightiest in the
dwellings of Ham.
But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep: and carried them in the
wilderness like a flock.
He brought them out safely, that they should not fear: and overwhelmed their
enemies with the sea.
And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary: even to his mountain
which he purchased with his right hand.
He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land to be divided among
them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not his testimonies;
But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers: starting aside like a
broken bow.
For they grieved him with their hill-altars: and provoked him to displeasure with
their images.
When God heard this, he was wroth: and took sore displeasure at Israel.
So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that he had pitched
among men.
He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with his inheritance.
The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not given to
marriage.
Their priests were slain with the sword: and there were no widows to make
lamentation.
So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep: and like a giant refreshed with wine.
He smote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a perpetual shame.
He refused the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
But chose the tribe of Judah: even the hill of Sion which he loved.
And there he built his temple on high: and laid the foundation of it like the
ground which he hath made continually.
He chose David also his servant: and took him away from the sheep-folds.
As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him: that he might
feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
So he fed them with a faithful and true heart: and ruled them prudently with all
his power.

Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem: and there was
no man to bury them.
We are become an open shame to our enemies: a very scorn and derision unto
them that are round about us.
Lord, how long wilt thou be angry: shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?
Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee: and upon
the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.
For they have devoured Jacob: and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon: for we are
come to great misery.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: O deliver us, and be
merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake.
Wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?
O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed: be openly shewed upon
the heathen in our sight.
O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to the
greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die.
And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee: reward
thou them , O Lord, seven-fold into their bosom.
So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for
ever: and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to
generation.
<h3>Psalm 79</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses. A testimony for Asaph: a Psalm concerning the Assyrian
HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep: shew
thyself also, thou that sittest upon the cherubims.
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses: stir up thy strength, and come, and
help us.
Turn us again, O God: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
O Lord God of hosts: how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears: and givest them plenteousness of
tears to drink.
Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh us
to scorn.
Turn us again, thou God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall
be whole.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and
planted it.
Thou madest room for it: and when it had taken root it filled the land.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it: and the boughs thereof were like
the goodly cedar-trees.
She stretched out her branches unto the sea: and her boughs unto the river.
Why hast thou then broken down her hedge: that all they that go by pluck off her
grapes?
The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up: and the wild beasts of the field
devour it.
Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven: behold, and visit this
vine;
And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted: and the branch
that thou madest so strong for thyself.
It is burnt with fire, and cut down: and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy
countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man, whom
thou madest so strong for thine own self.
And so will not we go back from thee: O let us live, and we shall call upon thy
Name.
Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.
<h3>Psalm 80</h3>
For the end. A psalm for Asaph, concerning the winepresses
SING we merrily unto God our strength: make a cheerful noise unto the God of
Jacob.
Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret: the merry harp with the lute.
Blow up the trumpet in the new-moon: even in the time appointed, and upon our
solemn feast-day.
For this was made a statute for Israel: and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony: when he came out of the land of
Egypt, and had heard a strange language.
I eased his shoulder from the burden: and his hands were delivered from making
the pots.
Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee: and heard thee what
time as the storm fell upon thee.
I proved thee also: at the waters of strife.
Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel: if thou wilt hearken unto me,
There shall no strange god be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any other god.
I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy
mouth wide, and I shall fill it.
But my people would not hear my voice: and Israel would not obey me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts: and let them follow their own
imaginations.
O that my people would have hearkened unto me: for if Israel had walked in my
ways,
I should soon have put down their enemies: and turned my hand against their
adversaries.
The haters of the Lord should have been found liars: but their time should have
endured for ever.
He should have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour: and with honey out of
the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 81</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
GOD standeth in the congregation of princes: he is a Judge among gods.
How long will ye give wrong judgement: and accept the persons of the ungodly?
Defend the poor and fatherless: see that such as are in need and necessity have
right.
Deliver the outcast and poor: save them from the hand of the ungodly.
They will not be learned nor understand, but walk on still in darkness: all the
foundations of the earth are out of course.
I have said, Ye are gods: and ye are all the children of the most Highest.
But ye shall die like men: and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth: for thou shalt take all heathen to thine
inheritance.
<h3>Psalm 82</h3>
A song of a psalm for Asaph
HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: refrain not thyself, O God.
For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring: and they that hate thee have lift up
their head.
They have imagined craftily against thy people: and taken counsel against thy
secret ones.
They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people:
and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
For they have cast their heads together with one consent: and are confederate
against thee;
The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismaelites: the Moabites and
Hagarenes;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek: the Philistines, with them that dwell at Tyre.
Assur also is joined with them: and have holpen the children of Lot.
But do thou to them as unto the Madianites: unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the
brook of Kison;
Who perished at Endor: and became as the dung of the earth.
Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeb: yea, make all their princes like
as Zeba and Salmana;
Who say, Let us take to ourselves: the houses of God in possession.
O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and as the stubble before the wind;
Like as the fire that burneth up the wood: and as the flame that consumeth the
mountains.
Persecute them even so with thy tempest: and make them afraid with thy storm.
Make their faces ashamed, O Lord: that they may seek thy Name.
Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more: let them be put to
shame, and perish.
And they shall know that thou, whose Name is Jehovah: art only the most Highest
over all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 83</h3>
For the end. A song for the sons of Core, concerning the winepresses
O HOW amiable are thy dwellings: thou Lord of hosts!
My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the Lord: my heart
and my flesh rejoice in the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest where she may
lay her young: even thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be alway praising thee.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are thy ways.
Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well: and the pools are filled
with water.
They will go from strength to strength: and unto the God of gods appeareth every
one of them in Sion.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer :hearken, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our defender: and look upon the face of thine Anointed.
For one day in thy courts: is better than a thousand.
I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God: than to dwell in the tents
of ungodliness.
For the Lord God is a light and defence: the Lord will give grace and worship,
and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a godly life.
O Lord God of hosts: blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 84</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou hast turned away the
captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people: and covered all their sins.
Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure: and turned thyself from thy wrathful
indignation.
Turn us then, O God our Saviour: and let thine anger cease from us.
Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever: and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from
one generation to another?
Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Shew us thy mercy, O Lord: and grant us thy salvation.
I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak
peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again.
For his salvation is nigh them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each
other.
Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness hath looked down from
heaven.
Yea, the Lord shall shew loving-kindness: and our land shall give her increase.
Righteousness shall go before him: and he shall direct his going in the way.

The sayings of the God-voiced prophets have been fulfilled in the Holy Scriptures, for now we see the accomplishment in Christ's <i class="name">Meeting</i>; thereby is the world enlightened and with its brilliant shine are saved those that sing: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou. </p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> With the earthly the heavenly are rejoicing, and the multitude of all the saints participate in the rejoicings; both the kings and princes, the rich and poor * we are all celebrating; for Christ hath prepared for us an enlightenment in the picture of His festival ** the god-effecting similitude which He hath received from the Virgin.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia :</i> Harmoniously have once resounded the instruments in honour of the golden-made, lifeless idol, and the light-bearing grace of the Comforter doth animate to the vociferation: O Sole Trinity, equal in might, unoriginate, blessed art Thou.
    <h3>Ode VIII</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> The youths in Babylon, burning with the divine zeal, have manfully scorned both the tyrant and the flame, and being thrown into the midst of the fire, but bedewed, sung : Bless the Lord, all ye the works of the Lord. Being perfect God by nature, Thou wast seen a perfect man also, preserving in both natures their properties, and as God giving assurance of the divine <i class="name">Meeting</i> in the flesh; Him adoring we sing: Bless the Lord, all ye the works of the Lord. Exalt the horn, O Word of God, of those who confess Thee to be God and man and who glorify Thy <i class="name">Meeting</i>, wherewith Thou hast vouchsafed unto all the faithful the life eternal and made of no effect the rage of the pagans, haters of Thy divine might. The new law shineth and the church is adorned, for the lightof Thy divine glory, O Christ the God, hath gone forth and manifested Thy light-like countenance in Thy <i class="name">Meeting</i> unto the salvation of Thy people that vociferate unto Thee: Bless the Lord, all ye the works of the Lord. </p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> O Thou, restoration of the fallen, joy of the despairing, instructress of those gone astray, healer of the sick and salvation for all Christians - do preserve, O Sovereign-Lady Theotokos, us that honour <i class="name">Meeting</i> of Thy Son; supplicate of Him that we may be delivered from the incursions of foreign nations.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia: The triply-shining form of Godhead looseth the chains and bedeweth</i> the flame; the youths hymn and the whole creation blesseth the Only Saviour and Maker as Benefactor.</p>
    <h3>Ode IX</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos :</i></p><p> Thy bringing forth hath proved incorrupt : God hath passed out of thy loins, as flesh-bearer did He appear on earth and hath lived among men ; wherefore we all magnify thee, O Theotokos. Let us sing an ode of thanksgiving unto the Lord who was pleased to grant us exceedingly abundant riches in <i class="name">Meeting</i> of His divine flesh which in battles affordeth so strong a support and honouring which we the faithful magnify Thee. O the wonders above understanding which Thou, O Lord, hast made for us that trust in Thee! For just as <i class="name">Meeting</i> was, Thou hast ineffably and awfully shown unto all the image thereof; do deliver those that honour it, from every anger and fall. O Word of God, Wisdom and Might and Image of the Father! O God comprehensible! Do make us worthy to accomplish the joyful celebration of Thy festival <i class="name">Meeting</i> in the light of good works, spiritually magnifying Thee.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> Truly thy height, O most pure one, is that of the mystery of God and the depth that of the divine and ineffable wisdom. For the Most High was unspeakably born of thee and the Invisible One became Visible in His fleshly <i class="name">Meeting</i>; adoring which we the faithful magnify thee.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia: Hail thou, O Queen, the glory of both mother and maiden, for no</i> mouth, however fluent and well-spoken, can be so eloquent as worthily to hymn thee, and every mind faileth to comprehend thy bringing forth; wherefore we with one voice glorify thee.</p>

        </p><p><i class="note">Canon to the precious & life-creating Cross of the Lord, the acrostic whereof is: “When the Cross was planted it uprooted deception”, the composition of Joseph, in Tone VI: </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> At thy command O Lord, * the nature of the waters that beforehand flowed freely was transformed * and became like the earth; * whereby Israel having traversed them dryshod * chanted unto Thee a hymn of victory. Mocked, the Master endured crucifixion, removing the mockeries of mankind in that He is the Lover of mankind. He is pierced by a spear, thereby slaying the adverse foe. Wielding Thy Cross like a bow, O merciful Savior, with the darts of the nails Thou didst wound the adversary, and heal us who of old were wounded by him. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> By the blood of the saints the abominable defilements of blood offered to the idols were abolished; and the whole earth is sanctified, ever blessing the martyrs with praises. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The hosts of heaven lifted their voice in song, beholding those on earth doing battle against incorporeal foes. Wherefore, the Judge of the contest hath crowned them victors. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “The record of Adam was torn asunder when Thou wast pierced by the spear, O my Son,” the most pure Lady cried out; “Wherefore, I hymn Thy suffering, which poureth forth dispassion upon all, O Master.” </p><p><i class="note">Another canon, of the most holy Theotokos. The composition of Joseph, in Tone VI:</i> </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. O Theotokos, preserve thy people, who hymn thy mighty works with love, and deliver them from harm; for thou art the intercessor, guide and confirmation of all, O pure one. O Virgin who gavest rise to the Water of immortality, grant us the waters of healing, washing away all the deadly passions of our souls and bodies. O Lady, full of the grace of God, thou wast shown to be the honored habitation of Him Who honored the nature of our forefather; wherefore, we beseech thee, O pure one: Deliver us from all dishonor. Having given birth to the Sun of righteousness for the world, O all-immaculate Maiden, drive the darkness away from those who hymn thee with faith in this thy splendid and holy temple. </p><h3>Ode III</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Lord and Savior, * Who in the beginning established the heavens * by Thine all-powerful Word , * and by the divine and all-accomplishing Spirit * hath granted them all their strength, * do Thou establish me on the unshakeable rock of Thy confession. O Jesus, Who stretched out the heaven as it were a curtain, Thou didst stretch out Thy hands upon the Tree, healing the intemperance of Adam, in that Thou art merciful, snatching all from the hands of the lying enemy. With thorns the iniquitous men crowned Thee, O Christ our King, Who hast crowned men with glory, uprooted the thorns of Adam’s disobedience, and planted the plant of understanding for all. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Mortal in essence, therein ye deigned to teach immortality, O most wise ones; wherefore, wounds and tribulations, persecutions and beatings, and the severing of your members, did ye all endure, rejoicing, O martyrs. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With steadfast intent ye brought low the lying enemy who boasted that he will destroy all things, O ye spiritual athletes who humbled yourselves for Christ; and having arrayed yourselves against him, ye were exalted with divine might. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Mother and ewe-lamb, beholding the Lamb Who is slaughtered of His own will going to His Passion, thou sheddest fountains of tears, saying: “What is this sacred thing, O my Child? How dost Thou die, intending to bring life to those who have died?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. In this thy divine temple, wherein thou hast shown forth a well-spring of miracles, O pure one, grant the salvific petitions of thy servants; and deliver them from torment, ever pouring forth thy divine visitation. Having given birth to Christ, the Abyss of mercies and Bestower of all good things, in a manner transcending cause and all telling, O pure one, thou hast truly shown this thy divine temple to be the cleansing of all the passions, through thy divine overshadowing. Blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, O Virgin Theotokos, joy of all; for thou hast truly given birth to the joy and gladness of the whole world, Him Who is the Lover of mankind, driving away sinful grief, O Bride of God. O Virgin, thou noetic coffer, who hast truly given birth to the incorrupt Manna: Come among us at this hour; and of all defilement rid us who in a pure manner call thee blessed. </p><h3>Ode IV</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Having never left the bosom of the Father, * Thou didst descend to earth O Christ God, * I have heard of the mystery of Thy dispensation, * and I have glorified Thee, * O only Lover of mankind. Having appeared on earth as a man, Thou didst make mankind heavenly; and suspended upon the Tree, O Master, Thou didst exalt with Thyself all who hymn Thy sufferings. For mortals Thou didst die, O Life, and for the unjust Thou didst endure violent suffering, O my righteous Jesus. We hymn Thine infinite tender compassion, O Long-suffering One. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The onslaught of wild beasts, the raging of the fire, the severing of hands and feet, the mutilation of your members, and all other tortures which win divine delight, did ye endure, O martyrs. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Crying out to Christ, the God of all, from the extremities of your bodies, O spiritual athletes, ye were heard, and have now been set high upon the rock of divine perfection. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Make entreaty for us to Him Who became incarnate from thee, O Theotokos, that we who glorify His sufferings may find help in time of peril. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. Of old, Habbakuk proclaimed thee the mountain overshadowed by the virtues, protecting all from the burning of the malice of our ancient foe, O most pure Lady Theotokos. Offer supplication unto the Lord Who became incarnate from thy most pure blood, O Lady, that He save from all harm thy people, who bless thee as is meet. This thy temple, full of the grace of God, hath become a source of healing for our souls and bodies, O most glorious one; for it causeth every disease to cease and washeth away the passions of those who with faith call thee blessed. By thy fervent and honorable visitation, O Virgin Lady, save all who with love flee to thine aid, and visit and grant their petitions which lead unto life. </p><h3>Ode V</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Having risen at dawn out of the night, * I entreat Thee O Lord my God: * grant me the forgiveness of my sins, * and guide my steps to the light * of thy commandments, I pray Thee.  Accepting crucifixion for the removal of evils, O Word of God, Thou didst taste gall, abolishing the bitter harm wrought by the pleasing fruit. Glory to Thy great loving-kindness! By Thy suspension upon the Cross, Thou didst cause the whole earth to quake by Thy divine might and healed the abasement thereof, O Master; thereby making wavering hearts steadfast in the knowledge of Thee. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Belial everywhere spread his evil nets, yet he did not ensnare the martyrs of Christ; for, receiving wings of fire, they reached the divine mansions. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Deified by God with the hand of His abundance, O passion-bearers, ye were in nowise daunted by painful tortures, since for you it was as though others were suffering; and ye remained thus, O most wise ones. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> When Thou wast hanging upon the Cross, the pure Virgin, wracked with lamentation, cried out: “With what eyes shall I look upon the burning Eye Who driest up all the depths, O my Son?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Night is bereft of light * for those without faith, O Christ, * but for the faithful there is enlightenment * in the sweetness of Thy words; * wherefore, I rise early unto Thee * and hymn Thy Divinity. Keeping vigil, we are weighed down by the sleep of sin, O pure one; yet in thy most honored temple take pity on us by thy vigilant divine supplication, O Bride of God. O pure one, grant a helping hand unto all of us who have recourse unto thee; wash away the defilement of all evil, and By thy prayers cleanse us of illness. O most pure Theotokos, who conceived God in thy virginal womb and hast given birth to Him: From all everlasting condemnation deliver those who hymn thee. The souls of those who come to thy temple with faith, having grown old through sins, are renewed, O most immaculate one, and they all glorify thee as is meet. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Sailing in the tempest of the cares of life, * together with the ship I have been submerged by sins, * and cast to the soul-corrupting beast, * wherefore like Jonah I cry to Thee, O Christ: * Lead me up from the deadly abyss. O only Redeemer, Thou didst pay Thy saving Blood as our price, redeeming us who were held captive, and bringing us to Thy Father, slaying the tyrant by the Cross, O supremely good Christ. Of old, through intemperance I suffered a grievous fall, but Christ, lifted up upon the Cross, His arms stretched out, exalted me, who had fallen, and manifestly healed all my wounds. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> In nowise sleeping the slumber of delusion, O martyrs, ye lulled to sleep every assault of the tormentors; and having fallen into the excellent sleep of the righteous, O blessed ones, ye became ever-watchful advocates for all. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Established firmly upon the rock of Christ’s divine precepts, O most glorious martyrs, ye remained unmoved by the wiles of the enemy; and with divine wisdom ye trampled him underfoot, divinely hastening to God. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Theotokos, thou hast given birth to a young Child, Who is known to exist timelessly with the Father, before all ages, and Who by His Cross hath renewed mankind, which had grown old through sins by the counsel of the author of evil. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Jonah cried out from the belly of Hades: * Lead my life up from corruption! * And we cry aloud unto Thee: * O almighty Savior, have mercy on us!  Thou alone hast poured forth the Water of salvation upon us, O only pure one, drying up the burning of delusions; and bedewing the true understanding of thy servants. O animate city of our God, free thy flock from godless barbarians, earthquake and want, and from every temptation. With the application of thy prayers cure the sores of our souls, O Theotokos, that we may hymn thee with divine voices. O Virgin Maiden, who by thy most pure birthgiving released Eve from pain: Release me from the pain of the passions of soul and body. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Of old the Children were shown to be * bedewed in the fiery furnace, * chanting and praising the one God saying: * 'Supremely exalted and exceedingly glorified is the God of our Fathers'. The life of our first parents, devoid of pain, did I find when thou wast suspended upon the Cross and willingly died, slaying the serpent, O greatly merciful Jesus Christ. We have all been delivered from the curse of the law; for the Bestower of the law was lifted up upon the Cross, pouring forth ever-flowing blessing, grace, mercy, and the abolition of corruption. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Approaching tortures with willing haste, the martyrs voluntarily emulated Him Who suffered; and, crowned by Him, they now join chorus with the angels. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Giving your bodies over to various torments, O most lauded martyrs, ye drowned the incorporeal foe in the streams of your blood, pouring forth fountains of healing. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “How can I not weep, beholding Thee upon the Cross, O my most sweet Child? How can I not lament Thee Who sufferest unjustly, O most righteous Judge?”, the Virgin Mother exclaimed. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. O all-hymned Virgin, who hast given birth to the divine Fire, burn up the tinder of the passions of those who hymn thee, and illumine all with the light of repentance, we pray. O incorrupt Maiden, deliver us from corruption; O animate palace of God, show us to be temples of the divine Spirit, that we may unceasingly hymn thee with faith in thy temple. Thou pourest forth streams of healings upon all, for thou hast given birth to the Source of life, O Theotokos. By thy fervent supplication cleanse this thy flock of defilement, O Bride of God. All the divine prophets, beholding the figures of thy divine birthgiving, chanted with joy, crying: O all-hymned God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Unconsumed by fire, the bush on Sinai spake unto Moses, * slow of speech and stammering, * and revealed God unto him; * and zeal for God showed forth the three Children who chanted hymns * to be unvanquished by the fire. * O all ye His works, praise ye the Lord * and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages. The blood and water which flowed from Thy side renewed the whole world and poured forth incorruption, O Savior, and brought abominable sacrifices and the shedding of corrupt blood to an end. Wherefore, all of us, Thy works, hymn Thee as Lord and supremely exalt Thee throughout all ages. Thou wast ringed about with a crown of thorns, wast given gall and vinegar to eat, wast spat upon, beaten and lifted up upon the Cross, Thy hands pierced with nails. And I, saved thereby, cry out to Thee: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Most splendidly enriched from the inexhaustible treasuries of truth, O spiritual athletes, ye spat upon all the poverty of the idols and showed yourselves to be enrichers of the poor, crying aloud: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having refused to obey the unlawful edicts of the tyrants, O martyrs, ye were cast into a fiery furnace like the youths, and therein found the dew of God which cooled you, as ye cried: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The ark of the law prefigured thee of old, O pure one, containing not the tablets of the law, but Christ, the Bestower of the law, Whom iniquitous men nailed to the Cross, and Who saveth us who cry: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The King of glory, who is alone without beginning, * Before Whom all the powers of heaven stand in awe * and the hosts of angels tremble: * O ye priests praise, and ye people * supremely exalt Him throughout the ages. Pouring forth an abyss of miracles upon the world, O all-hymned Virgin, dry up the stench of our passions, and pour forth the dew of remission upon us who honor thee with undoubting faith. The Sun of righteousness, Who shone forth from thee upon those sitting in the darkness of the passions, made thee light, O all-hymned and pure one; wherefore, we hymn thee as is meet, O Theotokos. As a most splendid temple of God, O pure one, show thy servants, assembled in thy holy temple, to be habitations of the Spirit; for we glorify thee throughout all ages. With the light of thy birthgiving thou hast wondrously enlightened the whole world, O Theotokos, bearing in thine arms the true God Who ever enlightens those who cry with faith: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the </p><p><i class="note">refrain:</i> “More honorable than the cherubim ...”<i class="note"> Prostrations.</i> </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Mother of God and Virgin, * thou hast given birth and yet remained a virgin, * not in accordance with nature, * but by the condescension of God; * wherefore, we ever magnify thee, * who alone wast deemed worthy * of the wonders of God.  The might of the enemy in nowise failed until Thou didst cry out mightily on the Tree to Thine beginningless Father, and called Thy scattered sheep to the knowledge of Thee, O Christ, mighty Master. Thou wast willingly lifted up upon the Cross like a lamb, O Master, snatching Thy reason-endowed sheep from the wolf, O Savior, and enclosing those who hymn thee in the fold of Thy precepts. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Shown to be emulators of Thy sufferings, the right glorious passion-bearers endured many and varied methods of torture, O Lover of mankind; wherefore, they received crowns of glory and have been deemed worthy of Thy kingdom, O Christ. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The solar rays of grace shine round about, illumining the faithful on the right laudable feast of the honored passion-bearers; wherefore, ever celebrating this, we are delivered from the darkness of grievous transgressions. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thy Son, the noetic Light, shone forth on the Cross O most pure one, rebuking the princes of darkness; and darkening the light of the sun, illumining the fullness of the faithful, O most immaculate one. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Conceiving without knowing corruption, * and lending thy flesh to the Word, * O Mother unwedded and Virgin Theotokos, * thou art the vessel of the Uncircumscribable One, * and dwelling place of thy Creator, * thee do we magnify. Thou wast shown to be more sacred than the hosts on high, for thou hast given birth to the Creator of all, O holy Theotokos, Mother who knewest not a man; wherefore, with the angels we glorify thee, unceasingly hymning thy mighty works. Enlightened by the rays of the divine Spirit, the most sacred prophet of old beheld thee as a mountain overshadowed, O Virgin Theotokos; wherefore, we on earth bless thee with the angels, as thou didst foretell, O thou who art blessed of God. Thou wast shown to be the jar holding the divine Manna, and wast seen to be a ladder leading mortals up from earth, O Virgin Theotokos who alone knewest not wedlock; wherefore, we, the faithful, having assembled, glorify thee as is meet, O divinely joyous one. O Maiden who wast the dwelling-place of the Godhead, bathing me with tears, cleanse me, who have become a den of soul-destroying thieves and a place where every iniquity is wrought; and show me to be an abode of the divine Spirit. O Virgin Lady, who alone hast given birth to the pre-eternal Light: Deliver me from everlasting darkness, and enlighten my soul which hath become wholly darkened through the passions of life, that I may ever glorify thee with love.

<h3>Psalm 85</h3>
A prayer of David
BOW down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor, and in misery.
Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: my God, save thy servant that putteth his
trust in thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I will call daily upon thee.
Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, art good and gracious: and of great mercy unto all them that call
upon thee.
Give ear, Lord, unto my prayer: and ponder the voice of my humble desires.
In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou hearest me.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord: there is not one that can do
as thou doest.
All nations whom thou hadst made shall come and worship thee, O Lord: and
shall glorify thy Name.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in thy truth: O knit my heart unto
thee, that I may fear thy Name.
I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and will praise thy Name for
evermore.
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the
nethermost hell.
O God, the proud are risen against me: and the congregations of naughty men
have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.
But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, plenteous
in goodness and truth.
O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength unto thy
servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.
Shew some token upon me for good, that they who hate me may see it and be
ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
<h3>Psalm 86</h3>
A psalm of a song for the sons of Core
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loveth the gates of Sion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Very excellent things are spoken of thee: thou city of God.
I will think upon Rahab and Babylon: with them that know me.
Behold ye the Philistines also: and they of Tyre, with the Morians; lo, there was
he born.
And of Sion it shall be reported that he was born in her: and the most High shall
stablish her.
The Lord shall rehearse it when he writeth up the people: that he was born
there.
The singers also and trumpeters shall he rehearse: All my fresh springs shall be
in thee.
<h3>Psalm 87</h3>
A song of a psalm for the sons of Core. For the end. Upon Maeleth, for responsive strains.
Concerning instruction for Æman the Israelite
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: O let my
prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling.
For my soul is full of trouble: and my life draweth nigh unto hell.
I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit: and I have been even as a
man that hath no strength.
Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded, and lie in the grave: who
are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit: in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
Thine indignation lieth hard upon me: and thou hast vexed me with all thy
storms.
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me: and made me to be
abhorred of them.
I am so fast in prison: that I cannot get forth.
My sight faileth for very trouble: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have
stretched forth my hands unto thee.
Dost thou shew wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise up again, and
praise thee?
Shall thy loving-kindness be shewed in the grave: or thy faithfulness in
destruction?
Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy righteousness in the
land where all things are forgotten?
Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come before thee.
Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face from me?
I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die: even from my youth
up thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me: and the fear of thee hath undone me.
They came round about me daily like water: and compassed me together on
every side.
My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me: and hid mine acquaintance
out of my sight.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 88</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Ætham the Israelite
MY SONG shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the Lord: with my mouth will I
ever be shewing thy truth from one generation to another.
For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever: thy truth shalt thou stablish in the
heavens.
I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn unto David my servant;
Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne from one generation to
another.
O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and thy truth in the
congregation of the saints.
For who is he among the clouds: that shall be compared unto the Lord?
And what is he among the gods: that shall be like unto the Lord?
God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints: and to be had in
reverence of all them that are round about him.
O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee: thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on
every side.
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.
Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it: thou hast scattered thine enemies
abroad with thy mighty arm.
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast laid the foundation of
the round world, and all that therein is.
Thou hast made the north and the south: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy
Name.
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat: mercy and truth shall go
before thy face.
Blessed is the people, O Lord, that can rejoice in thee: they shall walk in the light
of thy countenance.
Their delight shall be daily in thy Name: and in thy righteousness shall they
make their boast.
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy loving-kindness thou shalt lift
up our horns.
For the Lord is our defence: the Holy One of Israel is our King.
Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help
upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
I have found David my servant: with my holy oil have I anointed him.
My hand shall hold him fast: and my arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not be able to do him violence: the son of wickedness shall not
hurt him.
I will smite down his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.
My truth also and my mercy shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be
exalted.
I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand in the floods.
He shall call me, Thou art my Father: my God, and my strong salvation.
And I will make him my first-born: higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast with
him.
His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the days of
heaven.
But if his children forsake my law: and walk not in my judgements;
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I will visit their
offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.
Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my
truth to fail.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: I
have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David.
His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the sun before me.
He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the faithful witness in
heaven.
But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed: and art displeased at him.
Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his crown to the ground.
Thou hast overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong holds.
All they that go by spoil him: and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all his adversaries to
rejoice.
Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword: and givest him not victory in the
battle.
Thou hast put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: and covered him with dishonour.
Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever: and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
O remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men for
nought?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death: and shall he deliver his soul
from the hand of hell?
Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses: which thou swarest unto David in thy
truth?
Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I do bear in my
bosom the rebukes of many people.
Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of
thine Anointed: Praised be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 89</h3>
A prayer of Moses the man of God
LORD, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of
men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a
watch in the night.
As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut down,
dried up and withered.
For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance.
For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our years to an end, as
it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong
that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but labour and
sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.
But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man feareth,
so is thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be glad all the
days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us: and for the years
wherein we have suffered adversity.
Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou the work
of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handywork.
<h3>Psalm 90</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the most High: shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty..
I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my strong hold: my God, in him
will I trust.
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome
pestilence.
He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers:
his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by
day;
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness that destroyeth
in the noon-day.
A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall
not come nigh thee.
Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold: and see the reward of the ungodly.
For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of defence very high.
There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou
tread under thy feet.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him
up, because he hath known my Name.
He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble; I will
deliver him, and bring him to honour.
With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation.

        <h3>The Reading from the Book of Exodus (20:12-18).</h3><p>The Lord said unto Moses: Come up to Me into the mount and be there; and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written that thou mayest teach them. And Moses and his minister Joshua rose up and went up into the mount of God, and Moses said unto the elders: Tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you; and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. And the glory of the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And the seventh day the Lord called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. And Moses went into the midst of the cloud and gat him up into the mount; and was in the mount forty days and forty nights.</p><h3>The Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy. (4:1,6-15).</h3><p> Moses said unto the people: Now hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them, that ye may live. Keep therefore and do them;3 for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of thenations, which shall hear all these statutes and say: surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon Him for. And now take heed to yourselves, all ye the house of Israel, and keep your souls diligently, lest ye forget the things which your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your hearts all the days of your life. But teach them your sons and your sons' sons, specially the day that ye stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me: Gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children. .And ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds and thick darkness. And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude, only ye heard a voice. And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform. Aid the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that ye might do them in the land. The Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.</p><h3>The Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy (5:1-7,9,10,23-26,28; 6:1,2,4,5,13,18).</h3><p>Moses called all Israel, and said unto them: Hear, O Israel the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them and keep and do them: The Lord God made a covenant with you in Horeb, not with your fathers alone did the Lord make His covenant, but with you also. The Lord talked face to face in Horeb out of the midst of the fire, and I stood between the Lord and you at that time to declare unto you the words of the Lord saying: I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; there are no others gods beside Me, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments. And it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of fire, and the mountain did burn with fire, that ye all came near unto me,and ye said: Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed us His glory, and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God doth talk with man and he liveth. Now, why should we die? for this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die. For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the Lord speaking out of the midst of the fire, and liveth? And the Lord heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke unto me, and I said unto you all the commandments, the statutes and the judgments which the Lord commanded you that ye might fear all His statutes, that He may be merciful unto you and that ye may increase in the land. Hear, Israel, the Lord your God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy thought, with all thy heart, with all thy soul and with all thy might; thou shalt fear Him and serve Him alone, cleave unto Him, thou shalt swear by His name and shalt do that which is good in His sight, that it may be well with thee.

<h3>Psalm 91</h3>
A psalm of a song for the Sabbath-day
IT IS a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy
Name, O most Highest.
To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning: and of thy truth in the nightseason.
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute: upon a loud instrument,
and upon the harp.
For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works: and I will rejoice in giving
praise for the operations of thy hands.
O Lord, how glorious are thy works: thy thoughts are very deep.
An unwise man doth not well consider this: and a fool doth not understand it.
When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish: then shall they be destroyed for ever; but thou,
Lord, art the most Highest for evermore.
For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, lo, thine enemies shall perish: and all the workers
of wickedness shall be destroyed.
But mine horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn: for I am anointed with
fresh oil.
Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies: and mine ear shall hear his
desire of the wicked that arise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar
in Libanus.
Such as are planted in the house of the Lord: shall flourish in the courts of the
house of our God.
They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age: and shall be fat and wellliking.
That they may shew how true the Lord my strength is: and that there is no
unrighteousness in him.
<h3>Psalm 92</h3>
For the day before the Sabbath. When the land was first inhabited, the praise of a song by David
THE Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his
apparel, and girded himself with strength.
He hath made the round world so sure: that it cannot be moved.
Ever since the world began hath thy seat been prepared: thou art from
everlasting.
The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lift up their voice: the floods lift up
their waves.
The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly: but yet the Lord, who
dwelleth on high, is mightier.
Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becometh thine house for ever.
<h3>Psalm 93</h3>
A psalm of David for the fourth day of the week
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth: thou God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself.
Arise, thou Judge of the world: and reward the proud after their deserving.
Lord, how long shall the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly triumph?
How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully: and make such proud
boasting?
They smite down thy people, O Lord: and trouble thine heritage.
They murder the widow and the stranger: and put the fatherless to death.
And yet they say, Tush, the Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob
regard it.
Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the eye, shall he not
see?
Or he that nurtureth the heathen: it is he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not
he punish?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man: that they are but vain.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him in thy law.
That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity: until the pit be digged
up for the ungodly.
For the Lord will not fail his people: neither will he forsake his inheritance;
Until righteousness turn again unto judgement: all such as are true in heart shall
follow it.
Who will rise up with me against the wicked: or who will take my part against
the evil-doers?
If the Lord had not helped me: it had not failed but my soul had been put to
silence.
But when I said, My foot hath slipt: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.
In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart: thy comforts have
refreshed my soul.
Wilt thou have any thing to do with the stool of wickedness: which imagineth
mischief as a law?
They gather them together against the soul of the righteous: and condemn the
innocent blood.
But the Lord is my refuge: and my God is the strength of my confidence.
He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own
malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

<h3>Psalm 94</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
O COME, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our
salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: and shew ourselves glad in
him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God: and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hills is his
also.
The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep
of his hand.
To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the provocation,
and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: It is a people that
do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways;
Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.
<h3>Psalm 95</h3>
When the house was built after the captivity. A song by David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the whole earth.
Sing unto the Lord, and praise his Name: be telling of his salvation from day to
day.
Declare his honour unto the heathen: and his wonders unto all people.
For the Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised: he is more to be feared
than all gods.
As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols: but it is the Lord that made
the heavens.
Glory and worship are before him: power and honour are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people: ascribe unto the Lord
worship and power.
Ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his Name: bring presents, and come
into his courts.
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let the whole earth stand in awe of
him.
Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King: and that it is he who hath
made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; and how that he
shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea make a noise, and
all that therein is.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood
rejoice before the Lord.
For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: and with righteousness to judge
the world, and the people with his truth.
<h3>Psalm 96</h3>
For David, when his land is established
THE Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
may be glad thereof.
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgement are the
habitation of his seat.
There shall go a fire before him: and burn up his enemies on every side.
His lightnings gave shine unto the world: the earth saw it, and was afraid.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord
of the whole earth.
The heavens have declared his righteousness: and all the people have seen his
glory.
Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in vain
gods: worship him, all ye gods.
Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad, because of
thy judgements, O Lord.
For thou, Lord, art higher than all that are in the earth: thou art exalted far
above all gods.
O ye that love the Lord, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: the Lord
preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of
the ungodly.
There is sprung up a light for the righteous: and the joyful gladness for such as
are true-hearted.
Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous: and give thanks for a remembrance of his
holiness.

<h3>Psalm 97</h3>
A Psalm of David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous things.
With his own right hand, and with his holy arm: hath he gotten himself the
victory.
The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the
sight of the heathen.
He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel: and all the
ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.
Shew yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing, rejoice, and give thanks.
Praise the Lord upon the harp: sing to the harp with a psalm of thanksgiving.
With trumpets also and shawms: O shew yourselves joyful before the Lord the
King.
Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round world, and they that
dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together before the
Lord: for he is come to judge the earth.
With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with equity.
<h3>Psalm 98</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord is King, be the people never so unpatient: he sitteth between the
cherubims, be the earth never so unquiet.
The Lord is great in Sion: and high above all people.
They shall give thanks unto thy Name: which is great, wonderful, and holy.
The King's power loveth judgement; thou hast prepared equity: thou hast
executed judgement and righteousness in Jacob.
O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before his footstool, for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call upon his
Name: these called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar: for they kept his testimonies, and
the law that he gave them.
Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou forgavest them, O God, and
punishedst their own inventions.
O magnify the Lord our God, and worship him upon his holy hill: for the Lord our
God is holy.
<h3>Psalm 99</h3>
A psalm for thanksgiving
O BE joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come
before his presence with a song.
Be ye sure that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we
ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:
be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.
For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting: and his truth endureth from
generation to generation.
<h3>Psalm 100</h3>
A Psalm of David
MY SONG shall be of mercy and judgement: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.
O let me have understanding: in the way of godliness.
When wilt thou come unto me: I will walk in my house with a perfect heart.
I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of unfaithfulness: there shall
no such cleave unto me.
A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour: him will I destroy.
Whoso hath also a proud look and high stomach: I will not suffer him.
Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land: that they may dwell with
me.
Whoso leadeth a godly life: he shall be my servant.
There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house: he that telleth lies shall not
tarry in my sight.
I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land: that I may root out all
wicked doers from the city of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 101</h3>
A prayer for the poor, when he is deeply afflicted and pours out his supplication before the Lord
HEAR my prayer, O Lord: and let my crying come unto thee.
Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine ear unto me
when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.
For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt up as it
were a firebrand.
My heart is smitten down, and withered liked grass: so that I forget to eat my
bread.
For the voice of my groaning: my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.
I am become like a pelican in the wilderness: and like an owl that is in the desert.
I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that sitteth alone upon the
house-top.
Mine enemies revile me all the day long: and they that are mad upon me are
sworn together against me.
For I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping.
And that because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and
cast me down.
My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.
But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever: and thy remembrance throughout all
generations.
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that thou have mercy
upon her, yea, the time is come.
And why? thy servants think upon her stones: and it pitieth them to see her in
the dust.
The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy
majesty;
When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall appear;
When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute: and despiseth not
their desire.
This shall be written for those that come after: and the people which shall be
born shall praise the Lord.
For he hath looked down from his sanctuary: out of the heaven did the Lord
behold the earth;
That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity: and deliver the
children appointed unto death;
That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion: and his worship at
Jerusalem;
When the people are gathered together: and the kingdoms also, to serve the
Lord.
He brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.
But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age: as for thy
years, they endure throughout all generations.
Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax old as doth a
garment;
And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art
the same, and thy years shall not fail.
The children of thy servants shall continue: and their seed shall stand fast in thy
sight.
<h3>Psalm 102</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me praise his holy Name.
Praise the Lord, O my soul: and forget not all his benefits;
Who forgiveth all thy sin: and healeth all thine infirmities;
Who saveth thy life from destruction: and crowneth thee with mercy and lovingkindness;
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: making thee young and lusty as an
eagle.
The Lord executeth righteousness and judgement: for all them that are
oppressed with wrong.
He shewed his ways unto Moses: his works unto the children of Israel.
The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and of great goodness.
He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth he his anger for ever.
He hath not dealt with us after our sins: nor rewarded us according to our
wickednesses.
For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth: so great is his mercy
also toward them that fear him.
Look how wide also the east is from the west: so far hath he set our sins from us.
Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children: even so is the Lord merciful unto
them that fear him.
For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that we are but dust.
The days of man are but as grass: for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.
For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone: and the place thereof shall know
it no more.
But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon them that
fear him: and his righteousness upon children's children;
Even upon such as keep his covenant: and think upon his commandments to do
them.
The Lord hath prepared his seat in heaven: and his kingdom ruleth over all.
O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength: ye that fulfil his
commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words.
O praise the Lord, all ye his hosts: ye servants of his that do his pleasure.
O speak good of the Lord, all ye works of his, in all places of his dominion: praise
thou the Lord, O my soul.

<h3>Psalm 103</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art become exceeding
glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.
Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment: and spreadest out the
heavens like a curtain.
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: and maketh the clouds his
chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.
He maketh his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire.
He laid the foundations of the earth: that it never should move at any time.
Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment: the waters stand in the
hills.
At thy rebuke they flee: at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.
They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath: even unto the
place which thou hast appointed for them.
Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass: neither turn again to
cover the earth.
He sendeth the springs into the rivers: which run among the hills.
All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild asses quench their thirst.
Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation: and sing among the
branches.
He watereth the hills from above: the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
He bringeth forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the service of men;
That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of
man: and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen
man's heart.
The trees of the Lord also are full of sap: even the cedars of Libanus which he
hath planted;
Wherein the birds make their nests: and the fir-trees are a dwelling for the stork.
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats: and so are the stony rocks for the
conies.
He appointed the moon for certain seasons: and the sun knoweth his going down.
Thou makest darkness that it may be night: wherein all the beasts of the forest
do move.
The lions roaring after their prey: do seek their meat from God.
The sun ariseth, and they get them away together: and lay them down in their
dens.
Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour: until the evening.
O Lord, how manifold are thy works: in wisdom hast thou made them all; the
earth is full of thy riches.
So is the great and wide sea also: wherein are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great beasts.
There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan: whom thou hast made to take his
pastime therein.
These wait all upon thee: that thou mayest give them meat in due season.
When thou givest it them they gather it: and when thou openest thy hand they
are filled with good.
When thou hidest thy face they are troubled: when thou takest away their breath
they die, and are turned again to their dust.
When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made: and thou shalt renew
the face of the earth.
The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in
his works.
The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch the hills, they shall
smoke.
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will praise my God while I have my
being.
And so shall my words please him: my joy shall be in the Lord.
As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall
come to an end: praise thou the Lord, O my soul, praise the Lord.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 104</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his Name: tell the people what
things he hath done.
O let your songs be of him, and praise him: and let your talking be of all his
wondrous works.
Rejoice in his holy Name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek the Lord and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Remember the marvellous works that he hath done: his wonders, and the
judgements of his mouth.
O ye seed of Abraham his servant: ye children of Jacob his chosen.
He is the Lord our God: his judgements are in all the world.
He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise: that he made to a
thousand generations;
Even the covenant that he made with Abraham: and the oath that he sware unto
Isaac;
And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law: and to Israel for an everlasting
testament;
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan: the lot of your inheritance;
When there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in the land;
What time as they went from one nation to another: from one kingdom to another
people;
He suffered no man to do them wrong: but reproved even kings for their sakes;
Touch not mine Anointed: and do my prophets no harm.
Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land: and destroyed all the provision of
bread.
But he had sent a man before them: even Joseph, who was sold to be a bondservant;
Whose feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his soul;
Until the time came that his cause was known: the word of the Lord tried him.
The king sent, and delivered him: the prince of the people let him go free.
He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his substance;
That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach his senators wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people exceedingly: and made them stronger than their
enemies.
Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people: and dealt untruly with his
servants.
Then sent he Moses his servant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.
And these shewed his tokens among them: and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and it was dark: and they were not obedient unto his word.
He turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs: yea, even in their kings' chambers.
He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies: and lice in all their
quarters.
He gave them hail-stones for rain: and flames of fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and fig-trees: and destroyed the trees that were in
their coasts.
He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable:
and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their
ground.
He smote all the first-born in their land: even the chief of all their strength.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person
among their tribes.
Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were afraid of them.
He spread out a cloud to be a covering: and fire to give light in the night-season.
At their desire he brought quails: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in the
dry places.
For why? he remembered his holy promise: and Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy: and his chosen with gladness.
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people
in possession;
That they might keep his statutes: and observe his laws.

    <h3>Ode III</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> Neither in wisdom, nor in power and riches we glory, but in Thee,O Christ, the Hypo static Wisdom of the Father, for there is no one moreholy than Thou art, O Lover of man.

    <h3>Ode VIII</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> The youths in Babylon, burning with the divine zeal, have manfully scorned both the tyrant and the flame, and being thrown into the midst of the fire, but bedewed, sung : Bless the Lord, all ye the works of the Lord. Being perfect God by nature, Thou wast seen a perfect man also, preserving in both natures their properties, and as God giving assurance of the divine <i class="name">Meeting</i> in the flesh; Him adoring we sing: Bless the Lord, all ye the works of the Lord. Exalt the horn, O Word of God, of those who confess Thee to be God and man and who glorify Thy <i class="name">Meeting</i>, wherewith Thou hast vouchsafed unto all the faithful the life eternal and made of no effect the rage of the pagans, haters of Thy divine might.

<h3>Psalm 105</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for
ever.
Who can express the noble acts of the Lord: or shew forth all his praise?
Blessed are they that alway keep judgement: and do righteousness.
Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation;
That I may see the felicity of thy chosen: and rejoice in the gladness of thy
people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers: we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly.
Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great
goodness in remembrance: but were disobedient at the sea, even at the
Red sea.
Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake: that he might make his power
to be known.
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the
deep, as through a wilderness.
And he saved them from the adversaries' hand: and delivered them from the
hand of the enemy.
As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them: there was not
one of them left.
Then believed they his words: and sang praise unto him.
But within a while they forgat his works: and would not abide his counsel.
But lust came upon them in the wilderness: and they tempted God in the desert.
And he gave them their desire: and sent leanness withal into their soul.
They angered Moses also in the tents: and Aaron the saint of the Lord.
So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of
Abiram.
And the fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the ungodly.
They made a calf in Horeb: and worshipped the molten image.
Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.
And they forgat God their Saviour: who had done so great things in Egypt;
Wondrous works in the land of Ham: and fearful things by the Red sea.
So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood
before him in the gap: to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should
destroy them.
Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no credence unto his
word;
But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord.
Then lift he up his hand against them: to overthrow them in the wilderness;
To cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves unto Baal-peor: and ate the offerings of the dead.
Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions: and the plague was
great among them.
Then stood up Phinees and prayed: and so the plague ceased.
And that was counted unto him for righteousness: among all posterities for
evermore.
They angered him also at the waters of strife: so that he punished Moses for
their sakes;
Because they provoked his spirit: so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Neither destroyed they the heathen: as the Lord commanded them;
But were mingled among the heathen: and learned their works.
Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay: yea,
they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters:
whom they had offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled
with blood.
Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring with their own
inventions.
Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people: insomuch that
he abhorred his own inheritance.
And he gave them over into the hands of the heathen: and they that hated them
were lords over them.
Their enemies oppressed them: and had them in subjection.
Many a time did he deliver them: but they rebelled against him with their own
inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.
Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity: he heard their complaint.
He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude of
his mercies: yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity
them.
Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen: that we may
give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world without end: and
let all the people say, Amen.

And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west: from the
north and from the south.
They went astray in the wilderness out of the way: and found no city to dwell in;
Hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.
So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: and he delivered them from their
distress.
He led them forth by the right way: that they might go to the city where they
dwelt.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he satisfieth the empty soul: and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: being fast bound in misery
and iron ;
Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly regarded the
counsel of the most Highest;
He also brought down their heart through heaviness: they fell down, and there
was none to help them.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death: and brake
their bonds in sunder.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he hath broken the gates of brass: and smitten the bars of iron in sunder.
Foolish men are plagued for their offence: and because of their wickedness.
Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they were even hard at death's door.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
He sent his word, and healed them: and they were saved from their destruction.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving: and tell out his
works with gladness!
They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their business in great waters;
These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.
For at his word the stormy wind ariseth: which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep: their soul
melteth away because of the trouble.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are at their wits' end.
So when thy cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivereth them out of their
distress.
For he maketh the storm to cease: so that the waves thereof are still.
Then are they glad, because they are at rest: and so he bringeth them unto the
haven where they would be.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people: and praise him
in the seat of the elders!
Who turneth the floods into a wilderness: and drieth up the water-springs.
A fruitful land maketh he barren: for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water: and water-springs of a dry
ground.
And there he setteth the hungry: that they may build them a city to dwell in.
That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards: to yield them fruits of
increase.
He blesseth them so that they multiply exceedingly: and suffereth not their cattle
to decrease.
And again, when they are minished and brought low: through oppression,
through any plague or trouble;
Though he suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants: and let them wander
out of the way in the wilderness.
Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery: and maketh him households like a flock of
sheep.
The righteous will consider this, and rejoice: and the mouth of all wickedness
shall be stopped.
Whoso is wise will ponder these things: and they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 107</h3>
Song of a psalm by David
O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing and give praise with the
best member that I have.
Awake, thou lute, and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing praises unto
thee among the nations.
For thy mercy is greater than the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
That thy beloved may be delivered: let thy right hand save them, and hear thou
me.
God hath spoken in his holiness: I will rejoice therefore, and divide Sichem, and
mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head.
Judah is my law-giver, Moab is my wash-pot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe,
upon Philistia will I triumph.
Who will lead me into the strong city: and who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou forsaken us, O God: and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our
hosts?
O help us against the enemy: for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do great acts: and it is he that shall tread down our
enemies.
<h3>Psalm 108</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise: for the mouth of the ungodly, yea, the
mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.
And they have spoken against me with false tongues: they compassed me about
also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part: but I give
myself unto prayer.
Thus have they rewarded me evil for good: and hatred for my good will.
Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand.
When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned: and let his prayer be
turned into sin.
Let his days be few: and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless: and his wife a widow.
Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread: let them seek it also out of
desolate places.
Let the extortioner consume all that he hath: and let the stranger spoil his
labour.
Let there be no man to pity him: nor to have compassion upon his fatherless
children.
Let his posterity be destroyed: and in the next generation let his name be clean
put out.
Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight of the Lord:
and let not the sin of his mother be done away.
Let them alway be before the Lord: that he may root out the memorial of them
from off the earth.
And that, because his mind was not to do good: but persecuted the poor helpless
man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.
His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him: he loved not blessing,
therefore shall it be far from him.
He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a raiment: and it shall come into his
bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be unto him as the cloke that he hath upon him: and as the girdle that he is
alway girded withal.
Let it thus happen from the Lord unto mine enemies: and to those that speak evil
against my soul.
But deal thou with me, O Lord God, according unto thy Name: for sweet is thy
mercy.
O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor: and my heart is wounded within me.
I go hence like the shadow that departeth: and am driven away as the
grasshopper.
My knees are weak through fasting: my flesh is dried up for want of fatness.
I became also a reproach unto them: they that looked upon me shaked their
heads.
Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy.
And they shall know, how that this is thy hand: and that thou, Lord, hast done it.
Though they curse, yet bless thou: and let them be confounded that rise up
against me; but let thy servant rejoice.
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame: and let them cover themselves with
their own confusion, as with a cloke.
As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth: and praise him
among the multitude.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor: to save his soul from the
unrighteous judges.

        <h3>The Reading from the Book of Exodus (20:12-18).</h3><p>The Lord said unto Moses: Come up to Me into the mount and be there; and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written that thou mayest teach them. And Moses and his minister Joshua rose up and went up into the mount of God, and Moses said unto the elders: Tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you; and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. And the glory of the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And the seventh day the Lord called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. And Moses went into the midst of the cloud and gat him up into the mount; and was in the mount forty days and forty nights.</p><h3>The Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy. (4:1,6-15).</h3><p> Moses said unto the people: Now hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them, that ye may live. Keep therefore and do them;3 for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of thenations, which shall hear all these statutes and say: surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon Him for. And now take heed to yourselves, all ye the house of Israel, and keep your souls diligently, lest ye forget the things which your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your hearts all the days of your life. But teach them your sons and your sons' sons, specially the day that ye stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me: Gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children. .And ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds and thick darkness. And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude, only ye heard a voice. And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform. Aid the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that ye might do them in the land. The Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.</p><h3>The Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy (5:1-7,9,10,23-26,28; 6:1,2,4,5,13,18).</h3><p>Moses called all Israel, and said unto them: Hear, O Israel the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them and keep and do them: The Lord God made a covenant with you in Horeb, not with your fathers alone did the Lord make His covenant, but with you also. The Lord talked face to face in Horeb out of the midst of the fire, and I stood between the Lord and you at that time to declare unto you the words of the Lord saying: I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; there are no others gods beside Me, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments. And it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of fire, and the mountain did burn with fire, that ye all came near unto me,and ye said: Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed us His glory, and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God doth talk with man and he liveth. Now, why should we die? for this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die. For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the Lord speaking out of the midst of the fire, and liveth? And the Lord heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke unto me, and I said unto you all the commandments, the statutes and the judgments which the Lord commanded you that ye might fear all His statutes, that He may be merciful unto you and that ye may increase in the land. Hear, Israel, the Lord your God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy thought, with all thy heart, with all thy soul and with all thy might; thou shalt fear Him and serve Him alone, cleave unto Him, thou shalt swear by His name and shalt do that which is good in His sight, that it may be well with thee.

<h3>Psalm 134</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, laud ye the Name of the Lord: praise it, O ye servants of the
Lord;
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord: in the courts of the house of our God.
O praise the Lord, for the Lord is gracious: O sing praises unto his Name, for it is
lovely.
For why? the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself: and Israel for his own
possession.
For I know that the Lord is great: and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth: and in the sea,
and in all deep places.
He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world: and sendeth forth
lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his treasures.
He smote the first-born of Egypt: both of man and beast.
He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of Egypt:
upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.
He smote divers nations: and slew mighty kings;
Sehon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Basan: and all the kingdoms of
Canaan;
And gave their land to be an heritage: even an heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever: so doth thy memorial, O Lord, from one
generation to another.
For the Lord will avenge his people: and be gracious unto his servants.
As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold: the work of men's
hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, but they see not.
They have ears, and yet they hear not: neither is there any breath in their
mouths.
They that make them are like unto them: and so are all they that put their trust
in them.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Israel: praise the Lord, ye house of Aaron.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, praise the Lord.
Praised be the Lord out of Sion: who dwelleth at Jerusalem.

Who only doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who by his excellent wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who laid out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who hath made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The sun to rule the day: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The moon and the stars to govern the night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote Egypt with their first-born: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever;
With a mighty hand, and stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who divided the Red sea in two parts: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And made Israel to go through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever.
But as for Pharaoh and his host, he overthrew them in the Red sea: for his mercy
endureth for ever.
Who led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Yea, and slew mighty kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Sehon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And Og the king of Basan: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And gave away their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Even for an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who remembered us when we were in trouble: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And hath delivered us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 136</h3>
For David. A psalm of Jeremias
BY THE waters of Babylon we sat down and wept: when we remembered thee, O
Sion.
As for our harps, we hanged them up: upon the trees that are therein.
For they that led us away captive required of us then a song, and melody in our
heaviness: Sing us one of the songs of Sion.
How shall we sing the Lord's song: in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem: let my right hand forget her cunning.
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: yea, if I
prefer not Jerusalem in my mirth.
Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem: how they said,
Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.
O daughter of Babylon , wasted with misery: yea, happy shall he be that
rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us.
Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children: and throweth them against the
stones.

<h3>Psalm 137</h3>
A psalm of David, of Aggæus and Zacharias
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: even before the gods
will I sing praise unto thee.
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of thy
loving-kindness and truth: for thou hast magnified thy Name and thy word
above all things.
When I called upon thee, thou heardest me: and enduedst my soul with much
strength.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they have heard the words
of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: that great is the glory of the Lord.
For though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: as for the
proud, he beholdeth them afar off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me: thou shalt
stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy right
hand shall save me.
The lord shall make good his loving-kindness toward me: yea, thy mercy, O Lord,
endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine own hands.
<h3>Psalm 138</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
O LORD, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou knowest my downsitting and mine up-rising, thou understandest my thoughts long before.
Thou art about my path, and about my bed: and spiest out all my ways.
For lo, there is not a word in my tongue: but thou, O Lord, knowest it altogether.
Thou hast fashioned me behind and before: and laid thine hand upon me.
Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me: I cannot attain unto it.
Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit: or whither shall I go then from thy
presence?
If I climb up into heaven, thou art there: if I go down to hell, thou art there also.
If I take the wings of the morning: and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me.
If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall my night be turned
to day.
Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day:
the darkness and light to thee are both alike.
For my reins are thine: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous
are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.
My bones are not hid from thee: though I be made secretly, and fashioned
beneath in the earth.
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect: and in thy book were all
my members written;
Which day by day were fashioned: when as yet there was none of them.
How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God: O how great is the sum of them!
If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: when I wake up I am
present with thee.
Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God: depart from me, ye blood-thirsty men.
For they speak unrighteously against thee: and thine enemies take thy Name in
vain.
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee: and am not I grieved with those that
rise up against thee?
Yea, I hate them right sore: even as though they were mine enemies.
Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart: prove me, and examine my
thoughts.
Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me: and lead me in the way
everlasting.
<h3>Psalm 139</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
DELIVER me, O Lord, from the evil man: and preserve me from the wicked man.
Who imagine mischief in their hearts: and stir up strife all the day long.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: adders' poison is under their
lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly: preserve me from the wicked
men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.
The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with cords: yea, and
set traps in my way.
I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my prayers, O Lord.
O Lord God, thou strength of my health: thou hast covered my head in the day of
the battle.
Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord: let not his mischievous imagination
prosper, lest they be too proud.
Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them: that compass me
about.
Let hot burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire and into the
pit, that they never rise up again.
A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: evil shall hunt the wicked
person to overthrow him.
Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor: and maintain the cause of the
helpless.
The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name: and the just shall continue in
thy sight.

<h3>Psalm 140</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, I call upon thee, haste thee unto me: and consider my voice when I cry
unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense: and let the lifting up of my
hands be an evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and keep the door of my lips.
O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing: let me not be occupied in
ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, lest I eat of such things
as please them.
Let the righteous rather smite me friendly: and reprove me.
But let not their precious balms break my head: yea, I will pray yet against their
wickedness.
Let their judges be overthrown in stony places: that they may hear my words, for
they are sweet.
Our bones lie scattered before the pit: like as when one breaketh and heweth
wood upon the earth.
But mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust , O cast not out my
soul.
Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me: and from the traps of the
wicked doers.
Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together: and let me ever escape them.
<h3>Psalm 141</h3>
A psalm of instruction for David. When he was in the cave; a prayer
I CRIED unto the Lord with my voice: yea, even unto the Lord did I make my
supplication.
I poured out my complaints before him: and shewed him of my trouble.
When my spirit was in heaviness thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I
walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
I looked also upon my right hand: and saw there was no man that would know
me.
I had no place to flee unto: and no man cared for my soul.
I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said: Thou art my hope, and my portion in the land
of the living.
Consider my complaint: for I am brought very low.
O deliver me from my persecutors: for they are too strong for me.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name: which thing if
thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto my company.
<h3>Psalm 142</h3>
A psalm of David when his son pursued him
HEAR my prayer, O Lord, and consider my desire: hearken unto me for thy truth
and righteousness' sake.
And enter not into judgement with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
living be justified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the
ground: he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have been long
dead.
Therefore is my spirit vexed within me: and my heart within me is desolate.
Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works: yea, I exercise
myself in the works of thy hands.
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.
Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint: hide not thy face from
me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for in thee is my trust:
shew thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I flee unto thee to hide me.
Teach me to do a thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God: let thy loving
Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.
Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name's sake: and for thy righteousness' sake bring
my soul out of trouble.
And of thy goodness slay mine enemies: and destroy all them that vex my soul ;
for I am thy servant.

A psalm of David concerning Goliath
BLESSED be the Lord my strength: who teacheth my hands to war, and my
fingers to fight.
My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in whom I trust:
who subdueth my people that is under me.
Lord, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him: or the son of man, that
thou so regardest him?
Man is like a thing of nought: his time passeth away like a shadow.
Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall
smoke.
Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them: shoot out thine arrows, and consume
them.
Send down thine hand from above: deliver me, and take me out of the great
waters, from the hand of strange children.
Whose mouth talketh of vanity: and their right hand is a right hand of
wickedness.
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: and sing praises unto thee upon a tenstringed lute.
Thou hast given victory unto kings: and hast delivered David thy servant from
the peril of the sword.
Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children: whose mouth talketh
of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.
That our sons may grow up as the young plants: and that our daughters may be
as the polished corners of the temple.
That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of store: that our
sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets.
That our oxen may be strong to labour, that there be no decay: no leading into
captivity, and no complaining in our streets.
Happy are the people that are in such a case: yea, blessed are the people who
have the Lord for their God.
<h3>Psalm 144</h3>
David's Psalm of praise
I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King: and I will praise thy Name for ever and
ever.
Every day will I give thanks unto thee: and praise thy Name for ever and ever.
Great is the Lord, and marvellous worthy to be praised: there is no end of his
greatness.
One generation shall praise thy works unto another: and declare thy power.
As for me, I will be talking of thy worship: thy glory, thy praise, and wondrous
works;
So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts: and I will also tell of
thy greatness.
The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be shewed: and men shall sing of
thy righteousness.
The Lord is gracious and merciful: long-suffering and of great goodness.
The Lord is loving unto every man: and his mercy is over all his works.
All thy works praise thee, O Lord: and thy saints give thanks unto thee.
They shew the glory of thy kingdom: and talk of thy power;
That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom: might be known unto
men.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom: and thy dominion endureth throughout
all ages.
The Lord upholdeth all such as fall: and lifteth up all those that are down.
The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord: and thou givest them their meat in due
season.
Thou openest thine hand: and fillest all things living with plenteousness.
The Lord is righteous in all his ways: and holy in all his works.
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: yea, all such as call upon him
faithfully.
He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will
help them.
The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but scattereth abroad all the
ungodly.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh give thanks unto his
holy Name for ever and ever.

<h3>Psalm 145</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul; while I live will I praise the Lord: yea, as long as I
have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.
O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man: for there is no help in
them.
For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn again to his earth: and then
all his thoughts perish.
Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help: and whose hope is in the
Lord his God;
Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: who keepeth his
promise for ever;
Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong: who feedeth the hungry.
The Lord looseth men out of prison: the Lord giveth sight to the blind.
The Lord helpeth them that are fallen: the Lord careth for the righteous.
The Lord careth for the strangers, he defendeth the fatherless and widow :as for
the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.
The Lord thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore: and throughout all
generations.
<h3>Psalm 146</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God: yea, a
joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: and gather together the out-casts of Israel.
He healeth those that are broken in heart: and giveth medicine to heal their
sickness.
He telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and great is his power: yea, and his wisdom is infinite.
The Lord setteth up the meek: and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground.
O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving: sing praises upon the harp unto our God;
Who covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth: and
maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men;
Who giveth fodder unto the cattle: and feedeth the young ravens that call upon
him.
He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse: neither delighteth he in any
man's legs.
But the Lord's delight is in them that fear him: and put their trust in his mercy.
<h3>Psalm 147</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.
For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates: and hath blessed thy children within
thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: and his word runneth very
swiftly.
He giveth snow like wool: and scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who is able to abide his frost?
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he bloweth with his wind, and the
waters flow.
He sheweth his word unto Jacob: his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with any nation: neither have the heathen knowledge of his
laws.

Praise him, all ye heavens: and ye waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the Name of the Lord: for he spake the word, and they were
made; he commanded, and they were created.
He hath made them fast for ever and ever: he hath given them a law which shall
not be broken.
Praise the Lord upon earth: ye dragons, and all deeps;
Fire and hail, snow and vapours: wind and storm, fulfilling his word;
Mountains and all hills: fruitful trees and all cedars;
Beasts and all cattle: worms and feathered fowls;
Kings of the earth and all people: princes and all judges of the world;
Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of the Lord: for
his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven and earth.
He shalt exalt the horn of his people; all his saints shall praise him: even the

For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: and helpeth the meek-hearted.
Let the saints be joyful with glory: let them rejoice in their beds.
Let the praises of God be in their mouth: and a two-edged sword in their hands;
To be avenged of the heathen: and to rebuke the people;
To bind their kings in chains: and their nobles with links of iron.
That they may be avenged of them, as it is written: Such honour have all his
saints.
<h3>Psalm 150</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE God in his holiness: praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him in his noble acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.
Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: praise him upon the lute and harp.
Praise him in the cymbals and dances: praise him upon the strings and pipe.
Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: praise him upon the loud cymbals.
Let every thing that hath breath: praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 151</h3>
This psalm is ascribed to David and is outside the number. When he slew Goliath in single

LITTLE was I among my brethren: a younger brother in my father’s house.
My hands, they made an instrument of music: my fingers, they prepared a
psaltery.
And who shall bring back tidings to my master? The Lord himself, himself gives
ear.
Himself sent forth his messenger: and took me from among my father’s sheep;
and with the oil of his anointing He anointed me.
Comely my brethren were and tall: and yet they found not favor with the Lord.
But I, I sallied forth to meet the alien: and he reviled me by all his idols.
But I drew forth the sword that was beside him: I cut his head off with it, and
from the sons of Israel removed reproach.</div>

    <h3>Ode I</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> Unto Him that of old hath instructed Israel running away from Pharaoh's bondage, and hath fed them in the wilderness, unto our God, the Deliverer, let us sing; for He is glorified. On the day set apart for our festival let us, O people, open our mouths and expound with our tongues the divine manifestation of Christ our God in <i class="name">Meeting</i> cheerfully singing: For He is glorified. The Light Ever-existing, carrying out the words of the Father and desiring to shew His grace, hath taken the form of a servant for our sake and manifested Himself in the manner of His divine <i class="name">Meeting</i>, highly illumining us with light. O come ye all, let us in faith celebrate Christ's <i class="name">Meeting</i>, and intelligently offering the divine melody, let us glorify Him and vociferate harmoniously: Christ is come
    unto the restoration of the darkened. Let us sing unto Him, for He is glorified.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> This day's manifestation of the birth of the God incarnate we have truly learned through thee, O all-pure one, and honouring thee were accounted worthy to behold <i class="name">Meeting</i> of thy Son; Whom supplicate to save us from every danger.</p>
    <p><i class="note">For Katavasia:</i> Covered with divine darkness, the one slow of speech hath proclaimed the God-written law, for, having thrown the mire off his mental eye, he doth see the Existing One and ac- quireth knowledge of the Spirit, praising with divine songs.</p>
    <h3>Ode III</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> Neither in wisdom, nor in power and riches we glory, but in Thee,O Christ, the Hypo static Wisdom of the Father, for there is no one moreholy than Thou art, O Lover of man. Master by nature, Thou, O Christ, didst unite Thyself untoThy servants and becamest visible, working for us various forms of salvation which we now glorify in Thy <i class="name">Meeting</i>, for there is no one more holy than Thou art, O Lover of man. Thy people, O Christ, who are enlightened by the faith in Thee, brightly celebrate Thy divine festival <i class="name">Meeting</i>; honouring which we get delivered from dangers; vouchsafe unto us, O Saviour, the Kingdom of heaven also. O Life Hypostatical ! Having now tasted of death in the flesh and thereby made life to flow unto the dead, Thou hast, O Christ, granted us as meditator of life Thine awaking and Thy <i class="name">Meeting</i>.
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> The salvation hath before shone forth in the flesh out of thee in the world, and now unto the faithful through thee, O God's Mother, the life appeared in Christ's light-bearing <i class="name">Meeting</i> ; for the sake thereof do, O Theotokos, supplicate thy Son to deliver us from dangers and from everlasting torments.
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia: The fetters of the childless womb, and the unbearable insults from a</i> fruitful foe have of old been done away with in the case of Anna the prophetess solely by her prayer, brought with an afflicted spirit unto the Mighty One and God of wisdom.

    <h3>Ode IV</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p>Perceiving the unfathomable divine council with regard to the incarnation from the virgin of Thee, the High One, the prophet Habbakuk called out: Glory to Thy might, O Lord. The divine festival of One Who in the flesh drew so near unto men, as a light hath come to the newly elected Israel and enlighteneth to day the ends of the whole world by His <i class="name">Meeting</i>: Glory to Thy might, O Lord. Having been illumined, Moses was of old made worthy to see God's glory in Thy signs, and the new Israel doth now behold Thee, the Deliverer, clearly face to face: Glory to Thy might, O Lord. Behold, all ye people, the wonderful things, rejoice now in spirit, hymning <i class="name">Meeting</i> of Christ, Who hath appeared on earth unto men for their salvation: Glory to Thy might, O Lord.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O most pure Theotokos, save us that flee unto thee and celebrate Thy Son's divine <i class="name">Meeting</i>, and always supplicate Him to grant us remission of sins.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia:</i> O King of Kings, Sole from the only One, the Only Word of the Uncaused Father, Thou in Thy bounty hast truly sent down Thy Co-equal in might Spirit upon the apostles that hymn Thee: Glory to Thy might, O Lord.</p>
    <h3>Ode V</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> Thou Who hast dispersed the primordiate light that the works may in the light hymn Thee, O Christ, as the Creator, do in Thy light direct our paths. Let us to-day clap our hands and shout with our voices the praises of the Lord, for, behold, He hath truly appeared, enlightening all the faithful with the divine <i class="name">Meeting</i> of His most pure body. The assemblies of the faithful are to-day enlightened and the bands of heretics put to shame at the sight of the adoration of <i class="name">Meeting</i> of Christ, the Deliverer having assumed the bodily form. The festivity is come and the great mystery hath shone forth light from the countenance of the Lord in the well-arranged festival of the divine <i class="name">Meeting</i> of the Lord, for therewithal were granted unto all the captives peace and joy.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> Let the clouds drop sweetness from above unto the earthly, at thine intercession, O most holy Virgin; having taken compassion of the world, thy Son and our God hath to-day raised the horn of the Christians ; to-day hath He granted salvation unto the faithful by his divine <i class="name">Meeting</i>. </p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia:</i> O ye, illustrious children of the church ! Receive the fire-breathing dew of the Spirit for the perfect purification of sins, for now from Zion hath gone forth the law - the grace of the Spirit in the shape of the tongues of fire.</p>
    <h3>Ode VI</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p>Celebrating this divine and all-honourable feast of the Mother of God, come ye Godly- wise, let us clap our hands, glorifying the God that was born of her. Life hath shone forth unto the dead, and light hath come unto those that were already blind, and unto those grievously afflicted hath sprung up a cure, and salvation hath come nigh unto all through the lightbearing <i class="name">Meeting</i> of Christ. Let every intelligence rejoice, now clearly seeing the spiritual festival of the divine <i class="name">Meeting</i>, which doth shed enlightenment unto those that adore Him. O Lord, the heavens, seeing Thee, declare Thy glory, O Jesus Christ, they call together all Thy faithful to the hymning of Thy divine <i class="name">Meeting</i>, and those that are to come unto the knowledge of true repentance. </p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> O Mother of God ! there appeared unto the nations a sign and sure salvation, O pure Virgin, in the light of the honoured <i class="name">Meeting</i> of Thy Son; Him supplicate to save us that recall Thee, and deliver from dangers and incursions of pagans with thine interces- sions. </p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia:</i> O Christ! Thou hast shone forth from the Virgin unto us, O Master, as propitiation and salvation, that, just as once the prophet Jonah out of the belly of a sea-monster, Thou mightest rescue from corruption Adam, fallen with all his race.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Kontakion, in Tone II:</i> O uncircumscribed Word of the Father! knowing Thine undrawn by hand, but God-made icon to be the trophy of Thine ineffable and divine economy respecting men and of Thine undoubted incarnation, we honour Thee in kissing it.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Ikos:</i> Giving assurance unto men of the mystery of His incarnation, the Lord becometh Himself circumscribed by His God-and-man form; the Archetype thereof doth He seat on the Father's throne to be worshipped of the bodiless angels, and the adoration of an image of the Archetype hath He granted unto us; which embracing with our souls and hearts, we honour Him in kissing it.</p>
    <h3>Ode VII</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> The Abrahamic youths have once in Babylon trodden under their feet the flame of the furnace, calling out in songs: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou. Every city and country rejoice together with the new Zion in faithful celebration; for the King of her glory, Christ, hath come in the form of His venerable festival <i class="name">Meeting</i> and saveth those that adore Him and vociferate: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou. The sayings of the God-voiced prophets have been fulfilled in the Holy Scriptures, for now we see the accomplishment in Christ's <i class="name">Meeting</i>; thereby is the world enlightened and with its brilliant shine are saved those that sing: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou. </p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> With the earthly the heavenly are rejoicing, and the multitude of all the saints participate in the rejoicings; both the kings and princes, the rich and poor * we are all celebrating; for Christ hath prepared for us an enlightenment in the picture of His festival ** the god-effecting similitude which He hath received from the Virgin.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia :</i> Harmoniously have once resounded the instruments in honour of the golden-made, lifeless idol, and the light-bearing grace of the Comforter doth animate to the vociferation: O Sole Trinity, equal in might, unoriginate, blessed art Thou.
    <h3>Ode VIII</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> The youths in Babylon, burning with the divine zeal, have manfully scorned both the tyrant and the flame, and being thrown into the midst of the fire, but bedewed, sung : Bless the Lord, all ye the works of the Lord. Being perfect God by nature, Thou wast seen a perfect man also, preserving in both natures their properties, and as God giving assurance of the divine <i class="name">Meeting</i> in the flesh; Him adoring we sing: Bless the Lord, all ye the works of the Lord. Exalt the horn, O Word of God, of those who confess Thee to be God and man and who glorify Thy <i class="name">Meeting</i>, wherewith Thou hast vouchsafed unto all the faithful the life eternal and made of no effect the rage of the pagans, haters of Thy divine might. The new law shineth and the church is adorned, for the lightof Thy divine glory, O Christ the God, hath gone forth and manifested Thy light-like countenance in Thy <i class="name">Meeting</i> unto the salvation of Thy people that vociferate unto Thee: Bless the Lord, all ye the works of the Lord. </p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> O Thou, restoration of the fallen, joy of the despairing, instructress of those gone astray, healer of the sick and salvation for all Christians - do preserve, O Sovereign-Lady Theotokos, us that honour <i class="name">Meeting</i> of Thy Son; supplicate of Him that we may be delivered from the incursions of foreign nations.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia: The triply-shining form of Godhead looseth the chains and bedeweth</i> the flame; the youths hymn and the whole creation blesseth the Only Saviour and Maker as Benefactor.</p>
    <h3>Ode IX</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos :</i></p><p> Thy bringing forth hath proved incorrupt : God hath passed out of thy loins, as flesh-bearer did He appear on earth and hath lived among men ; wherefore we all magnify thee, O Theotokos. Let us sing an ode of thanksgiving unto the Lord who was pleased to grant us exceedingly abundant riches in <i class="name">Meeting</i> of His divine flesh which in battles affordeth so strong a support and honouring which we the faithful magnify Thee. O the wonders above understanding which Thou, O Lord, hast made for us that trust in Thee! For just as <i class="name">Meeting</i> was, Thou hast ineffably and awfully shown unto all the image thereof; do deliver those that honour it, from every anger and fall. O Word of God, Wisdom and Might and Image of the Father! O God comprehensible! Do make us worthy to accomplish the joyful celebration of Thy festival <i class="name">Meeting</i> in the light of good works, spiritually magnifying Thee.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> Truly thy height, O most pure one, is that of the mystery of God and the depth that of the divine and ineffable wisdom. For the Most High was unspeakably born of thee and the Invisible One became Visible in His fleshly <i class="name">Meeting</i>; adoring which we the faithful magnify thee.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia: Hail thou, O Queen, the glory of both mother and maiden, for no</i> mouth, however fluent and well-spoken, can be so eloquent as worthily to hymn thee, and every mind faileth to comprehend thy bringing forth; wherefore we with one voice glorify thee.</p>

In gladness we cry out to thee with the voice of Gabriel, O pure one: Rejoice, O most pure one, thou hope of all! Rejoice, O Bride of God! </p><h3>Ode III</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The Church of Christ hath been confirmed by faith; * wherefore she crieth out unceasingly in hymns, chanting: * Holy art Thou, O Lord! * and my spirit doth hymn Thee!  O Thou Who dost breathe life into me, and art dispassionate in essence, how dost Thou endure suffering? How dost Thou die upon the Tree? Great is Thy mercy and long-suffering, O Savior! Thou wast unjustly lifted up upon the Cross between two thieves, O Word, and didst justify him who by faith acknowledged Thee as the Author of all creation Who suffered of His own will. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Enduring the convulsions of their flesh, the severing of their hands and feet, and all their members, the passion-bearers were deemed worthy of glory, and pray for us. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Made radiant in God by many and varied torments, ye have now inherited great glory, O wise ones, ever praying for our souls. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> By thy maternal supplications grant release from our debts, O pure Virgin who hast given birth to God the Word Who was nailed as a man to the Cross. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing.

O Virgin, we have all understood thee to be the holy ground which without seed put forth for us Jesus Christ, the comely Grain Who feedeth those who bless thee with faith and love. The ways of God Most High were seen in thee, O Virgin, when He ineffably became incarnate; for thou wast the Mother of Him Who reigneth over all.

Habbakuk heard of thee, O most pure one, as the mountain illumined by the overshadowing of the Spirit; for from thee hath God revealed Himself incarnate. The assembly of the Orthodox is set aright, hymning thee as the all-holy Mother of God, and crying out to thee with the angel: “Rejoice!” Beaten is the face of Nestorius, who did not wish to consider thee the pure Theotokos; for thou didst truly give birth unto God, O most pure one. The Bridegroom found thee to be comely and radiant in goodness, O all-pure one, and He abode within thee and made thee the Theotokos. </p><h3>Ode V</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> My soul riseth unto Thee at dawn, O God, * for Thou art light, and Thy commandments * have become healing for Thy servants, * O Lover of mankind.

Loving thy godly, comely, most sweet and goodly beauty, O Virgin Sovereign Lady, the Master made His abode within thee.

Let those who confess thee to be the Theotokos receive through thy light the kingdom and food which pass not away, O Mother, Virgin and Theotokos. Thou wast shown to be the temple of the Omnipotent One Who seeth all things; for, finding thy womb to be more honorable than the heavens, He dwelt therein, O all-pure Birthgiver of God. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Jonah cried out from the belly of Hades: * Lead my life up from corruption! * And we cry aloud unto Thee: * O almighty Savior, have mercy on us!  Manifesting Thyself in the tender compassion of Thy mercy, O Physician of the infirm, by Thy Cross and sufferings Thou didst heal infirm human nature. Of old Adam brought condemnation upon himself through the tree; but now he hath been justified by the tree of the Cross, gaining access to paradise and receiving delight. We hymn Thee Who wast crucified in the flesh; we glorify Thee Who wast crowned with thorns and hast crowned us with glory, O supremely good King. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having rejected the pernicious harm of the madness of idolatry, the spiritual athletes underwent tortures; and having died with Christ, they now reign. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Neither persecution, nor starvation, nor nakedness, nor tribulation, nor death could in anywise separate the godly passion-bearers from the love of Christ. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thou didst glorify Him Who became incarnate from thee, and gazing upon Him Who was lifted up upon the Cross, thou didst weep for Him, O holy and all-immaculate Virgin Mother. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing.

Thou hast given birth in two natures to Emmanuel, Who was the perfect Word from the beginning, and is now God incarnate, Who granteth us redemption. The word of God described thee beforehand as the ark which received the tablets of the law, O Theotokos, for thou didst receive in thy womb Him Who became incarnate for our sake. Even the fulsome tongues of the angels are unable to proclaim thy praises, O pure one; but we, taking it up now as servants, offer thee Gabriel’s cry: “Rejoice!”. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Of old the Children were shown to be * bedewed in the fiery furnace, * chanting and praising the one God saying: * 'Supremely exalted and exceedingly glorified is the God of our Fathers'.

Of old, thine Offspring saved those who were in the fiery furnace; and now He hath saved us who cry aloud at His coming which transcendeth all telling: Blessed art Thou, O God of our fathers! David the ancestor of God described thy glory, O all-immaculate Virgin, and manifestly prophesied thee as the Queen of creation, who standeth at the right hand of the God of our fathers. By the restoration of thy birthgiving thou didst renew the nature of mortals, O pure one; wherefore, we cry out to thee: Blessed is the Fruit of thy womb throughout all ages, O Sovereign Lady! In His mercy the second Adam through thee, O most pure one, called to Him the first Adam, who had been condemned and held fast by death, and who now crieth aloud: Blessed art Thou, Who wast born and hast restored me! </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The King of glory, who is alone without beginning, * Before Whom all the powers of heaven stand in awe * and the hosts of angels tremble: * O ye priests praise, and ye people * supremely exalt Him throughout the ages. The tree of understanding rendered me mortal; but, having died upon the Tree Thou didst enliven me, O my Christ, and enlightened me to chant: Hymn the Lord, O ye priests, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages. O King, the law-breaking assembly crowned with thorns Thee, Who uprootest the thorns of first-formed Adam’s disobedience; and they suspended upon the Cross Thee, Who hast delivered all from the abyss of deception. Upon the Tree mindless men stretched Thee out, Who spread out the heavens with understanding, O Savior, Who healest our sufferings by Thy suffering, and causeth our pain to cease through the pain caused in Thy hands by the nails. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The relics of the martyrs emit the sweet fragrance of miracles for those who approach with undoubting heart, and they ever dispel the fetor of the passions, and in God impart health unto all. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The ranks of the saints pray to the Master, Who issued forth from thy womb, and on the Cross showed them the path of suffering, O pure one; and they glorify thee as the Queen of all. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. The unapproachable Master of all, Whom the heavens cannot contain, was contained within thy womb, O Birthgiver of God; wherefore, with love we the faithful, supremely exalt thee throughout the ages. The Mind Who transcendeth all creation, and upon Whom human nature is unable to gaze, didst thou bear in thy most pure arms, O Maiden; wherefore, with love we, the faithful, supremely exalt thee throughout all ages. Entreat God, Who was born of thee, O Virgin, that upon those who honor thee with faith He send down salvation, release from misfortunes, the speedy cure of grievous ailments, and eternal grace. Knowing thee to be the splendid temple of the Most High, adorned with divers virtues, O all-holy Virgin, we piously hymn and glorify thee throughout all ages. We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the </p><p><i class="note">refrain:</i> “More honorable than the cherubim ...”<i class="note"> Prostrations.</i> </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O all-hymned one, * who art higher in eminence than the heavens: * having seedlessly conceived the beginningless Word * thou hast given birth to the incarnate God for all mankind. * Wherefore, we all magnify thee.  When they saw Thee lifted up upon the Cross, O Jesus, almighty King of ages, the sun was darkened, the earth quaked, and the splendor of the veil of the temple was rent asunder. The iniquitous ran Thy hands and feet through with nails, pierced Thy life-bearing side with a spear, and gave Thee gall and vinegar to drink, O my Christ, Thou true God and delight of all. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> They who were broken by all manner of tortures, broke asunder the nets of the author of evil; and having been crowned with victory, the valiant spiritual athletes are called blessed. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Through the deposit of their relics the passion-bearers sanctified the whole earth and, cast into the midst of the fire and mystically consumed, they set at naught the vile stench of the sacrifices of the idols. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O blessed one, who art holier than the cherubim, and hast given birth in the flesh unto the Word of God, Who was willingly lifted up upon the Cross: Earnestly pray to Him on behalf of us all. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Same as the foregoing. Most perfect humanity was received from thee, O most pure Maiden, when the Word united Himself to animate flesh and a soul adorned with discourse; wherefore, all of us, the faithful, magnify thee. Let the foolishness of the rhetors keep silence, but let the trumpet of the apostles sound forth, praising thee, O Virgin, with cries of truth, and declaring thee the to be the true Theotokos. Because of thee mercy was shown to mankind, which was hypostaticaily united to the true Word, O Virgin, and by God’s gift became divine; wherefore, we all ever magnify thee. The mystery of thy birthgiving was first understood through the visions of the prophets, O Maiden, who for the sake of mankind hast given birth to the incarnate God, Who delivereth us from perils By thy prayers.

<h3>Psalm 119</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN I was in trouble I called upon the Lord: and he heard me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitful tongue.
What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue: even mighty
and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.
Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech: and to have my
habitation among the tents of Kedar.
My soul hath long dwelt among them: that are enemies unto peace.
I labour for peace, but when I speak unto them thereof: they make them ready to
battle.
<h3>Psalm 120</h3>
A song of ascents
I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel: shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defence upon thy right hand.
So that the sun shall not burn thee by day: neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even he that shall keep thy
soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from this time forth for
evermore.
<h3>Psalm 121</h3>
A song of ascents
I WAS glad when they said unto me: We will go into the house of the Lord.
Our feet shall stand in thy gates: O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city: that is at unity in itself.
For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord: to testify unto Israel, to
give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.
For there is the seat of judgement: even the seat of the house of David.
O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
Peace be within thy walls: and plenteousness within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions' sakes: I will wish thee prosperity.
Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God: I will seek to do thee good.
<h3>Psalm 122</h3>
A song of ascents
UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as
the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even so our eyes wait
upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are utterly despised.
Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy: and with the
despitefulness of the proud.
<h3>Psalm 123</h3>
A song of ascents
IF THE Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say: if the Lord
himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;
They had swallowed us up quick: when thy were so wrathfully displeased at us.
Yea, the waters had drowned us: and the stream had gone over our soul.
The deep waters of the proud: had gone even over our soul.
But praised be the Lord: who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.
Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler: the snare is
broken, and we are delivered .
Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 124</h3>
A song of ascents
THEY that put their trust in the Lord shall be even as the mount Sion: which may
not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.
The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about his
people, from this time forth for evermore.
For the rod of the ungodly cometh not into the lot of the righteous: lest the
righteous put their hand unto wickedness.
Do well, O Lord: unto those that are good and true of heart.
As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness: the Lord shall lead them
forth with the evil-doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 125</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion: then were we like unto them
that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue with joy.
Then said they among the heathen: The Lord hath done great things for them.
Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already: whereof we rejoice.
Turn our captivity, O Lord: as the rivers in the south.
They that sow in tears: shall reap in joy.
He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed: shall
doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.
<h3>Psalm 126</h3>
A song of ascents
EXCEPT the Lord build the house: their labour is but lost that build it.
Except the Lord keep the city: the watchman waketh but in vain.
It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat
the bread of carefulness: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Lo, children and the fruit of the womb: are an heritage and gift that cometh of
the Lord.
Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant: even so are the young children.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed
when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
<h3>Psalm 127</h3>
A song of ascents
BLESSED are all they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: O well is thee, and happy shalt
thou be.
Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of thine house.
Thy children like the olive-branches: round about thy table.
Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the Lord.
The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shalt see Jerusalem in
prosperity all thy life long.
Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children: and peace upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 128</h3>
A song of ascents
MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up: may Israel now
say.
Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up: but they have not
prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed upon my back: and made long furrows.
But the righteous Lord: hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.
Let them be confounded and turned backward: as many as have evil will at Sion.
Let them be even as the grass growing upon the house-tops: which withereth
afore it be plucked up;
Whereof the mower filleth not his hand: neither he that bindeth up the sheaves
his bosom.
So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord prosper you: we wish you
good luck in the Name of the Lord.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 129</h3>
A song of ascents
OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.
O let thine ears consider well: the voice of my complaint.
If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss: O Lord, who may
abide it?
For there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared.
I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him: in his word is my trust.
My soul fleeth unto the Lord: before the morning watch, I say, before the
morning watch.
O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with him is
plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel: from all his sins.
<h3>Psalm 130</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, I am not high-minded: I have no proud looks.
I do not exercise myself in great matters: which are too high for me.
But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his
mother: yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.
O Israel, trust in the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 131</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, remember David: and all his trouble;
How he sware unto the Lord: and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God of Jacob;
I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house: nor climb up into my bed;
I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eye-lids to slumber: neither the
temples of my head to take any rest;
Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord: an habitation for the mighty
God of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of the same at Ephrata: and found it in the wood.
We will go into his tabernacle: and fall low on our knees before his footstool.
Arise, O Lord, into thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness: and let thy saints sing with
joyfulness.
For thy servant David's sake: turn not away the presence of thine Anointed.
The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David: and he shall not shrink from it;
Of the fruit of thy body: shall I set upon thy seat.
If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall learn them:
their children also shall sit upon thy seat for evermore.
For the Lord hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself: he hath longed for
her.
This shall be my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.
I will bless her victuals with increase: and will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will deck her priests with health: and her saints shall rejoice and sing.
There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: I have ordained a lantern for
mine Anointed.
As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame: but upon himself shall his
crown flourish.
<h3>Psalm 132</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is: brethren, to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down unto the beard:
even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts of his clothing.
Like as the dew of Hermon: which fell upon the hill of Sion.
For there the Lord promised his blessing: and life for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 133</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD now, praise the Lord: all ye servants of the Lord;
Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord: even in the courts of the house of
our God.
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary: and praise the Lord.
The Lord that made heaven and earth: give thee blessing out of Sion.

        <h3>The Reading from the Book of Exodus (20:12-18).</h3><p>The Lord said unto Moses: Come up to Me into the mount and be there; and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written that thou mayest teach them. And Moses and his minister Joshua rose up and went up into the mount of God, and Moses said unto the elders: Tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you; and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. And the glory of the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And the seventh day the Lord called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. And Moses went into the midst of the cloud and gat him up into the mount; and was in the mount forty days and forty nights.</p><h3>The Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy. (4:1,6-15).</h3><p> Moses said unto the people: Now hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them, that ye may live. Keep therefore and do them;3 for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of thenations, which shall hear all these statutes and say: surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon Him for. And now take heed to yourselves, all ye the house of Israel, and keep your souls diligently, lest ye forget the things which your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your hearts all the days of your life. But teach them your sons and your sons' sons, specially the day that ye stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me: Gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children. .And ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds and thick darkness. And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude, only ye heard a voice. And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform. Aid the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that ye might do them in the land. The Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.</p><h3>The Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy (5:1-7,9,10,23-26,28; 6:1,2,4,5,13,18).</h3><p>Moses called all Israel, and said unto them: Hear, O Israel the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them and keep and do them: The Lord God made a covenant with you in Horeb, not with your fathers alone did the Lord make His covenant, but with you also. The Lord talked face to face in Horeb out of the midst of the fire, and I stood between the Lord and you at that time to declare unto you the words of the Lord saying: I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; there are no others gods beside Me, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments. And it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of fire, and the mountain did burn with fire, that ye all came near unto me,and ye said: Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed us His glory, and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God doth talk with man and he liveth. Now, why should we die? for this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die. For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the Lord speaking out of the midst of the fire, and liveth? And the Lord heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke unto me, and I said unto you all the commandments, the statutes and the judgments which the Lord commanded you that ye might fear all His statutes, that He may be merciful unto you and that ye may increase in the land. Hear, Israel, the Lord your God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy thought, with all thy heart, with all thy soul and with all thy might; thou shalt fear Him and serve Him alone, cleave unto Him, thou shalt swear by His name and shalt do that which is good in His sight, that it may be well with thee.

<h3>Psalm 109</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool.
The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: be thou ruler, even in the
midst among thine enemies.
In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free-will offerings with an holy
worship: the dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning.
The Lord sware, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech..
The Lord upon thy right hand: shall wound even kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places with the dead bodies:
and smite in sunder the heads over divers countries.
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up his head.
<h3>Psalm 110</h3>
Alleluia
I WILL give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart: secretly among the
faithful, and in the congregation.
The works of the Lord are great: sought out of all of them that have pleasure
therein.
His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour: and his righteousness
endureth for ever.
The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvellous works: that they
ought to be had in remembrance.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he shall ever be mindful of his
covenant.
He hath shewed his people the power of his works: that he may give them the
heritage of the heathen.
The works of his hands are verity and judgement: all his commandments are
true.
They stand fast for ever and ever: and are done in truth and equity.
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever;
holy and reverend is his Name.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all
they that do thereafter; the praise of it endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 111</h3>
Alleluia
BLESSED is the man that feareth the Lord: he hath great delight in his
commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall be
blessed.
Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth
for ever.
Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness: he is merciful, loving, and
righteous.
A good man is merciful, and lendeth: and will guide his words with discretion.
For he shall never be moved: and the righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance.
He will not be afraid of any evil tidings: for his heart standeth fast, and believeth
in the Lord.
His heart is established, and will not shrink: until he see his desire upon his
enemies.
He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor: and his righteousness
remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him: he shall gnash with his teeth,
and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.

<h3>Psalm 112</h3>
Alleluia
PRAISE the Lord, ye servants: O praise the Name of the Lord.
Blessed be the Name of the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
The Lord's Name is praised: from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of
the same.
The Lord is high above all heathen and his glory above the heavens.
Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling so high: and yet
humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?
He taketh up the simple out of the dust: and lifteth the poor out of the mire;
That he may set him with the princes: even with the princes of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house: and to be a joyful mother of
children.
<h3>Psalm 113</h3>
Alleluia
WHEN Israel came out of Egypt: and the house of Jacob from among the strange
people.
Judah was his sanctuary: and Israel his dominion.
The sea saw that, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams: and the little hills like young sheep.
What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest: and thou Jordan, that thou wast
driven back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams: and ye little hills, like young sheep?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the God of
Jacob.
Who turned the hard rock into a standing water: and the flint-stone into a
springing well.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise: for thy
loving mercy and for thy truth's sake.
Wherefore shall the heathen say: Where is now their God?
As for our God, he is in heaven: he hath done whatsoever pleased him.
Their idols are silver and gold: even the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not.
They have ears, and hear not: noses have they and smell not.
They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not: neither speak
they through their throat.
They that make them are like unto them ; and so are all such as put their trust in
them.
But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their succour and defence.
Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
Ye that fear the Lord, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
The Lord hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us: even he shall bless the
house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.
He shall bless them that fear the Lord: both small and great.
The Lord shall increase you more and more: you and your children.
Ye are the blessed of the Lord: who made heaven and earth.
All the whole heavens are the Lord's: the earth hath he given to the children of
men.
The dead praise not thee, O Lord: neither all they that go down into silence.
But we will praise the Lord: from this time forth for evermore. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 114</h3>
Alleluia
I AM well pleased: that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer.
That he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call upon him as long as I
live.
The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of hell gat hold
upon me.
I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I will call upon the Name of the Lord: O
Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea, our God is merciful
The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.
Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul: for the Lord hath rewarded thee.
And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from tears, and my
feet from falling.
I will walk before the Lord: in the land of the living.

<h3>Psalm 115</h3>
Alleluia
I BELIEVED, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled: I said in my
haste, All men are liars.
What reward shall I give unto the Lord: for all the benefits that he hath done
unto me?
I will receive the cup of salvation: and call upon the Name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: right dear in the sight of
the Lord is the death of his saints.
Behold, O Lord, how that I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thine
handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the Name of
the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of all his people: in the courts of
the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 116</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, all ye heathen: praise him, all ye nations.
For his merciful kindness is ever more and more towards us: and the truth of the
Lord endureth for ever. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 117</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: because his mercy endureth for
ever.
Let Israel now confess that he is gracious: and that his mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
Yea, let them now that fear the Lord confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
I called upon the Lord in trouble: and the Lord heard me at large.
The Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man doeth unto me.
The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire
upon mine enemies.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in man.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in princes.
All nations compassed me round about: but in the Name of the Lord will I destroy
them.
They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side: but in the
Name of the Lord will I destroy them.
They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire among the thorns:
for in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.
Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but the Lord was my help.
The Lord is my strength, and my song: and is become my salvation.
The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous: the right hand of
the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass.
The right hand of the Lord hath the pre-eminence: the right hand of the Lord
bringeth mighty things to pass.
I shall not die, but live: and declare the works of the Lord.
The Lord hath chastened and corrected me: but he hath not given me over unto
death.
Open me the gates of righteousness: that I may go into them, and give thanks
unto the Lord.
This is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into it.
I will thank thee, for thou hast heard me: and art become my salvation.
The same stone which the builders refused: is become the head-stone in the
corner.
This is the Lord's doing: and it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath made: we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Help me now, O Lord: O Lord, send us now prosperity.
Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: we have wished you good
luck , ye that are of the house of the Lord.
God is the Lord who hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, yea,
even unto the horns of the altar.
Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: thou art my God, and I will praise thee.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for ever.

Being perfect God by nature, Thou wast seen a perfect man also, preserving in both natures their properties, and as God giving assurance of the divine <i class="name">Meeting</i> in the flesh; Him adoring we sing: Bless the Lord, all ye the works of the Lord. Exalt the horn, O Word of God, of those who confess Thee to be God and man and who glorify Thy <i class="name">Meeting</i>, wherewith Thou hast vouchsafed unto all the faithful the life eternal and made of no effect the rage of the pagans, haters of Thy divine might.

<h4>First Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 1</h3>
BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
stood in the way of sinners: and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful.
But his delight is in the law of the Lord: and in his law will he exercise himself
day and night.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side: that will bring forth his
fruit in due season.
His leaf also shall not wither: and look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper.
As for the ungodly, it is not so with them: but they are like the chaff, which the
wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.
Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment: neither the
sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
But the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: and the way of the ungodly shall
perish.
<h3>Psalm 2</h3>
WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why do the people imagine a
vain thing?
The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together: against the
Lord, and against his Anointed.
Let us break their bonds asunder: and cast away their cords from us.
He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: the Lord shall have them
in derision.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath: and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Yet I have set my King: upon my holy hill of Sion.
I will preach the law, whereof the Lord hath said unto me: Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee.
Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance: and the
utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron: and break them in pieces like a
potter's vessel.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be learned, ye that are judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord in fear: and rejoice unto him with reverence.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way: if his wrath
be kindled, (yea, but a little,) blessed are all they that put their trust in
him.
<h3>Psalm 3</h3>
A psalm of David. When he fled from the presence of his son Absalom
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me: many are they that rise against
me.
Many one there be that say of my soul: There is no help for him in his God.
But thou, O Lord, art my defender: thou art my worship, and the lifter up of my
head.
I did call upon the Lord with my voice: and he heard me out of his holy hill.
I laid me down and slept, and rose up again: for the Lord sustained me.
I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people: that have set themselves
against me round about.
Up, Lord, and help me, O my God: for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the
cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.
    </div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 4</h3>
For the end. A song of David among the Psalms
HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast set me at liberty
when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour: and have such
pleasure in vanity, and seek after leasing?
Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that is godly: when
I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart, and in your chamber,
and be still.
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness: and put your trust in the Lord.
There be many that say: Who will shew us any good?
Lord, lift thou up: the light of thy countenance upon us.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart: since the time that their corn and wine and
oil increased.
I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest: for it is thou, Lord, only, that
makest me dwell in safety.
<h3>Psalm 5</h3>
For the end. A song of David concerning her that inherits
PONDER my words, O Lord: consider my meditation
O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King, and my God: for unto thee
will I make my prayer.
My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O Lord: early in the morning will I direct my
prayer unto thee, and will look up.
For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness: neither shall any devil
dwell with thee.
Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest all of them that
work vanity.
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor both the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude of thy
mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies: make thy way
plain before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in his mouth: their inward parts are very wickedness.
Their throat is an open sepulchre: they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own imaginations: cast
them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebelled
against thee.
And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: they shall ever be giving of
thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be
joyful in thee;
For thou, Lord, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous: and with thy favourable
kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
<h3>Psalm 6</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns for the eighth
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy
displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones are
vexed.
My soul also is sore troubled: but, Lord, how long wilt thou punish me?
Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's sake.
For in death no man remembereth thee: and who will give thee thanks in the pit?
I am weary of my groaning; every night wash I my bed: and water my couch with
my tears.
My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of all mine enemies.
Away from me, all ye that work vanity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my
weeping.
The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer.
All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed: they shall be turned back,
and put to shame suddenly.
    </div>

<h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 7</h3>
A psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the Benjamite
O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all them that
persecute me, and deliver me;
Lest he devour my soul, like a lion, and tear it in pieces: while there is none to
help.
O Lord my God, if I have done any such thing: or if there be any wickedness in
my hands;
If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me: yea, I have delivered
him that without any cause is mine enemy,
Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me: yea, let him tread my life
down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.
Stand up, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignation of
mine enemies: arise up for me in the judgement that thou hast
commanded.
And so shall the congregation of the people come about thee: for their sakes
therefore lift up thyself again.
The Lord shall judge the people; give sentence with me, O Lord: according to my
righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in me.
O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end: but guide thou the just.
For the righteous God: trieth the very hearts and reins.
My help cometh of God: who preserveth them that are true of heart.
God is a righteous Judge, strong and patient: and God is provoked every day.
If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword: he hath bent his bow, and made it
ready.
He hath prepared for him the instruments of death: he ordaineth his arrows
against the persecutors
Behold, he travaileth with mischief: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth
ungodliness.
He hath graven and digged up a pit: and is fallen on himself into the destruction
that he made for other.
For his travail shall come upon his own head: and his wickedness shall fall on his
own pate.
I will give thanks unto the Lord, according to his righteousness: and I will praise
the Name of the Lord most High.
<h3>Psalm 8</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the winepresses
O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world: thou hast set
thy glory above the heavens!
Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength,
because of thine enemies: that thou mightest still the enemy and the
avenger.
For I will consider thy heavens, even the works of thy fingers: the moon and the
stars, which thou hast ordained.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him: and the son of man, that thou visitest
him?
Thou madest him lower than the angels: to crown him with glory and worship.
Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands: and thou hast put
all things in subjection under his feet;
All sheep and oxen: yea, and the beasts of the field;
The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and whatsoever walketh through
the paths of the seas.
O Lord our Governor: how excellent is thy Name in all the world!

         </p><h3>THE READING FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON </h3><p>The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God, and there shall no torment  touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die, and their departure is  taken for misery, and their going from us to be utter destruction, but they are in  peace. For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of  immortality. And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded, for  God proved them and found them worthy for Himself. As gold in the furnace hath  He tried them, and received them as a burnt offering. And in the time of their  visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. They  shall judge the nations and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign  for ever. They that put their trust in Him shall understand the truth; and such as be  faithful in love shall abide with Him; for grace and mercy is to His saints and  visitation for His elect. </p><h3>A READING FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON  </h3><p>The righteous live for evermore; their reward also is with the Lord, and the care of  them is with the Most High. Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a  beautiful crown from the Lord’s hand: for with his right hand shall He cover them,  and with His arm shall He protect them. He shall take to Him His jealousy for  complete armor, and make the creature His weapon for the revenge of His enemies.  He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate, and true judgment for an invincible  shield. His severe wrath shall He sharpen for a sword, and the world shall fight with  Him against the unwise. Then shall the right-aiming thunderbolts go abroad; and  from the clouds, as from a well drawn bow, shall they be cast as out of a stone bow,  and the water of the sea shall rage against them, and the floods shall cruelly drown  them. Yea, a mighty wind shall stand up against them, and like a storm shall blow  them away: thus iniquity shall lay waste the whole earth, and ill dealing shall  overthrow the thrones of the mighty. Hear, therefore, aye kings, and understand;  learn, ye that be judges of the ends of the earth. Give ear, ye that rule the people, and  glory in the multitude of nations. For power is given you by the Lord, and sovereignty  from the Most High.  </p><h3>A READING FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON  </h3><p>Though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shall he be in rest. For  honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by  number of years. But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old  age. He pleased God, and was beloved of Him: so that living among sinners he was  translated. Yea, speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness should alter his  understanding, or deceit beguile his soul. For the bewitching of naughtiness doth  obscure things that are honest; and the wandering of concupiscence doth undermine  the simple mind. He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a long time: for his  soul pleased the Lord; therefore hasted He to take him away from among the wicked.  This the people saw, and understood not, neither laid they up this in their minds: that  His grace and mercy is with His saints, and that He hath respect unto His chosen.

<h3>Psalm9</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the secrets of the Son
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will speak of all thy
marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O thou
most Highest.
While mine enemies are driven back: they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in the throne that
judgest right.
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly: thou hast put out
their name for ever and ever.
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: even as the cities which
thou hast destroyed, their memorial is perished with them.
But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath also prepared his seat for judgement.
For he shall judge the world in righteousness: and minister true judgement unto
the people.
The Lord also will be a defence for the oppressed: even a refuge in due time of
trouble.
And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast
never failed them that seek thee.
O praise the Lord which dwelleth in Sion: show the people of his doings.
For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them :and forgetteth
not the complaint of the poor.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider the trouble which I suffer of them that
hate me: thou that liftest me up from the gates of death.
That I may shew all thy praises within the ports of the daughter of Sion: I will
rejoice in thy salvation.
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the same net which they
hid privily, is their foot taken.
The Lord is known to execute judgement: the ungodly is trapped in the work of
his own hands.
The wicked shall be turned into hell: and all the people that forget God.
For the poor shall not always be forgotten: the patient abiding of the meek shall
not perish for ever.
Up, Lord, and let not man have the upper hand: let the heathen be judged in thy
sight.
Put them in fear, O Lord: that the heathen may know themselves to be but men.
Why standest thou so far off, O Lord: and hidest thy face in the needful time of
trouble?
The ungodly for his own lust doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the
crafty wiliness that they have imagined.
For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire: and speaketh good of
the covetous, whom God abhorreth.
The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God ; neither is God in all his
thoughts.
His ways are always grievous: thy judgments are far above out of his sight, and
therefore defieth he all his enemies.
For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down: there shall no
harm happen unto me.
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is ungodliness
and vanity.
He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets: and privily in his lurking
dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.
For he lieth waiting secretly, even as a lion lurketh he in his den: that he may
ravish the poor.
He doth ravish the poor: when he getteth him into his net.
He falleth down, and humbleth himself: that the congregation of the poor may
fall into the hands of his captains.
He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face, and
he will never see it.
Arise, O Lord God, and lift up thine hand: forget not the poor.
Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God: while he doth say in his heart,
Tush, thou God carest not for it.
Surely thou hast seen it: for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong.
That thou mayest take the matter into thy hand: the poor committeth himself
unto thee; for thou art the helper of the friendless.
Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious: take away his ungodliness,
and thou shalt find none.
The Lord is King for ever and ever: and the heathen are perished out of the land.
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the poor: thou preparest their heart, and
thine ear hearkeneth thereto;
To help the fatherless and poor unto their right: that the man of the earth be no
more exalted against them.
<h3>Psalm10</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
IN THE Lord put I my trust: how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a
bird unto the hill?
For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the
quiver: that they may privily shoot at them which are true of heart.
For the foundations will be cast down: and what have the righteous done?
The Lord is in his holy temple: the Lord's seat is in heaven.
His eyes consider the poor: and his eye-lids try the children of men.
The Lord alloweth the righteous: but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in
wickedness, doth his soul abhor.
Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest:
this shall be their portion to drink.
For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness: his countenance will behold the
thing that is just

<h3>Psalm11</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, upon the eighth
HELP me, Lord, for there is not one godly man left: for the faithful are minished
from among the children of men,
They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour: they do but flatter with their
lips, and dissemble in their double heart.
The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips: and the tongue that speaketh proud
things;
Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail: we are they that ought to
speak , who is lord over us?
Now for the comfortless trouble's sake of the needy: and because of the deep
sighing of the poor,
I will up, saith the Lord: and will help every one from him that swelleth against
him, and will set him at rest.
The words of the Lord are pure words: even as the silver, which from the earth is
tried, and purified seven times in the fire.
Thou shalt keep them, O Lord: thou shalt preserve him from this generation for
ever.
The ungodly walk on every side: when they are exalted, the children of men are
put to rebuke.
<h3>Psalm12</h3>
For the end, psalm of David
HOW long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever: how long wilt thou hide thy face
from me?
How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart: how long
shall mine enemies triumph over me?
Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in
death.
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: for if I be cast down, they
that trouble me will rejoice at it.
But my trust is in thy mercy: and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.
I will sing of the Lord, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me: yea, I will
praise the Name of the Lord most Highest.
<h3>Psalm13</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE fool hath said in his heart: There is no God.
They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings: there is none that
doeth good, no not one.
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there
were any that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is none that doeth good, no not one.
Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have they deceived: the
poison of asps is under their lips.
Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood.
Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they not
known ; there is no fear of God before their eyes.
Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief: eating up my
people as it were bread, and call not upon the Lord?
There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was: for God is in the
generation of the righteous.
As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor: because he putteth
his trust in the Lord.
Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turneth the
captivity of his people: then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

<h3>Psalm14</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle: or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?
Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life: and doeth the thing which is right, and
speaketh the truth from his heart.
He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour: and
hath not slandered his neighbour.
He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes: and maketh much of
them that fear the Lord.
He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not: thou it were to
his own hindrance.
He that hath not given his money upon usury: nor taken reward against the
innocent.
Whoso doeth these things: shall never fall.
<h3>Psalm15</h3>
A writing of David
PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee have I put my trust.
O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, my goods are nothing
unto thee.
All my delight is upon the saints, that are in the earth: and upon such as excel in
virtue.
But they that run after another god: shall have great trouble.
Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer: neither make mention of their
names within my lips.
The Lord himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou shalt
maintain my lot.
The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will thank the Lord for giving me warning: my reins also chasten me in the
night-season.
I have set God always before me: for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not
fall.
Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiced: my flesh also shall rest in
hope.
For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell: neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy
One to see corruption.
Thou shalt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is the fulness of joy: and at
thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.
<h3>Psalm16</h3>
A prayer of David
HEAR the right, O Lord, consider my complaint: and hearken unto my prayer,
that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence: and let thine eyes look upon the
thing that is equal.
Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night-season; thou hast tried me,
and shalt find no wickedness in me; for I am utterly purposed that my
mouth shall not offend.
Because of men's works, that are done against the words of thy lips: I have kept
me from the ways of the destroyer.
O hold thou up my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps slip not.
I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: incline thine ear to me,
and hearken unto my words.
Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which
put their trust in thee: from such as resist thy right hand.
Keep me as the apple of an eye: hide me under the shadow of thy wings.
From the ungodly that trouble me: mine enemies compass me round about to
take away my soul.
They are enclosed in their own fat: and their mouth speaketh proud things.
They lie waiting in our way on every side: turning their eyes down to the ground.
Like of a lion that is greedy of his prey: and as it were a lion's whelp. lurking in
secret places.
Up, Lord, disappoint him, and cast him down: deliver my soul from the ungodly,
which is a sword of thine;
From the men of thy hand, O Lord, from the men, I say, and from the evil world:
which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid
treasure.
They have children at their desire: and leave the rest of their substance for their
babes.
But as for me, I will behold thy presence in righteousness: and when I awake up
after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied with it.</div>

<h3>Psalm 17</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David the servant of the Lord. The words which he spoke to the Lord,
even the words of this song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his
enemies, and out of the hand of Saul. And he said:
I WILL love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony rock, and my
defence: my saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust, my
buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.
I will call upon the Lord, which is worthy to be praised: so shall I be safe from
mine enemies.
The sorrows of death compassed me: and the overflowings of ungodliness made
me afraid.
The pains of hell came about me: the snares of death overtook me.
In my trouble I will call upon the Lord: and complain unto my God.
So shall he hear my voice out of his holy temple: and my complaint shall come
before him, it shall enter even into his ears.
The earth trembled and quaked: the very foundations also of the hills shook, and
were removed, because he was wroth.
There went a smoke out in his presence: and a consuming fire out of his mouth,
so that coals were kindled at it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and it was dark under his feet.
He rode upon the cherubim, and did fly: he came flying upon the wings of the
wind.
He made darkness his secret place: his pavilion round about him, with dark
water and thick clouds to cover him.
At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed: hail-stones and coals of
fire.
The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hailstones and coals of fire.
He sent out his arrows, and scattered them: he cast forth lightnings, and
destroyed them.
The springs of water were seen, and the foundations of the round world were
discovered, at thy chiding, O Lord: at the blasting of the breath of thy
displeasure.
He shall send down from on high to fetch me: and shall take me out of many
waters.
He shall deliver from me my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me: for
they are too mighty for me.
They prevented me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my upholder.
He brought me forth also into a place of liberty: he brought me forth even
because he had a favour unto me.
The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing: according to the cleanness
of my hands shall he recompense me.
Because I have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not forsaken my God, as the
wicked doth.
For I have an eye unto all his laws: and will not cast out his commandments from
me.
I was also uncorrupt before him: and eschewed mine own wickedness.
Therefore shall the Lord reward me after my righteous dealing: and according
unto the cleanness of my hands in his eye-sight.
With the holy thou shalt be holy: and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.
With the clean thou shalt be clean: and with the froward thou shalt learn
frowardness.
For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity: and shalt bring down the
high looks of the proud.
Thou also shalt light my candle: the Lord my God shall make my darkness to be
light.
For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men: and with the help of my God I shall
leap over the wall.
The way of God is an undefiled way: the word of the Lord also is tried in the fire;
he is the defender of all them that put their trust in him.
For who is God, but the Lord: or who hath any strength, except our God?
It is God, that girdeth me with strength of war: and maketh my way perfect.
He maketh my feet like harts' feet: and setteth me up on high.
He teacheth mine hands to fight: and mine arms shall break even a bow of steel.
Thou hast given me the defence of my salvation: thy right hand also shall hold
me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.
Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go: that my footsteps shall not
slide.
I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them: neither will I turn again till I
have destroyed them.
I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand: but fall under my feet.
Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou shalt throw done mine
enemies under me.
Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me: and I shall
destroy them that hate me.
They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them: yea, even unto the Lord
shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.
I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I will cast them out as the
clay in the streets.
Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people: and thou shalt make me
the head of the heathen.
A people whom I have not known: shall serve me.
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: but the strange children shall
dissemble with me.
The strange children shall fail: and be afraid out of their prisons.
The Lord liveth, and blessed be my strong helper: and praised be the Lord of my
salvation.
Even the God that seeth that I be avenged: and subdueth the people unto me.
It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine
adversaries: thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.
For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles: and sing
praises unto thy Name.
Great prosperity giveth he unto his King: and showeth loving-kindness unto
David his Anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.

<h3>Psalm 18</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament showeth his
handiwork.
One day telleth another: and one night certifieth another.
There is neither speech nor language: but their voices are heard among them.
Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words into the ends of the world.
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun: which cometh forth as a
bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.
It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the
end of it again: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, converting the soul: the testimony of the
Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: the commandment of
the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever: the judgments of the Lord
are true, and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also
than honey, and the honey-comb.
Moreover, by them is thy servant taught: and in keeping of them there is great
reward.
Who can tell how oft he offendeth: O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.
Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion over
me: so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart: be alway
acceptable in thy sight,
O Lord: my strength, and my redeemer.
<h3>Psalm 19</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the Name of the God of Jacob defend
thee;
Send thee help from the sanctuary: and strengthen thee out of Sion;
Remember all thy offerings: and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
Grant thee thy heart's desire: and fulfil all thy mind.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God:
the Lord perform all thy petitions.
Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Anointed, and will hear him from his holy
heaven: even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.
Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the
Name of the Lord our God.
They are brought down, and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, Lord and hear us, O King of heaven: when we call upon thee.
<h3>Psalm 20</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be of thy
salvation.
Thou hast given him his heart's desire: and hast not denied him the request of
his lips.
For thou shalt prevent him with the blessings of goodness: and shalt set a crown
of pure gold upon his head.
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life: even for ever and ever.
His honour is great in thy salvation: glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon
him.
For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity: and make him glad with the joy of thy
countenance.
And why? because the King putteth his trust in the Lord: and in the mercy of the
most Highest he shall not miscarry.
All thine enemies shall feel thine hand: thy right hand shall find out them that
hate thee.
Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: the Lord shall
destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.
Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth: and their seed from among the
children of men.
For they intended mischief against thee: and imagined such a device as they are
not able to perform.
Therefore shalt thou put them to flight: and the strings of thy bow shalt thou
make ready against the face of them.
Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so we will sing, and praise thy
power.

<h3>Psalm 21</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the morning aid.
MY GOD, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me: and art so far from
my health, and from the words of my complaint?
O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not: and in the night-season
also I take no rest.
And thou continuest holy: O thou worship of Israel.
Our fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them.
They called upon thee, and were holpen: they put their trust in thee, and were
not confounded.
But as for me, I am a worm, and no man: a very scorn of men, and the outcast of
the people.
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot our their lips, and shake their
heads, saying,
He trusted in God, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, if he will have
him.
But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: thou wast my hope, when
I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.
I have been left unto thee ever since I was born: thou art my God, even from my
mother's womb.
O go not from me, for trouble is hard at hand: and there is none to help me.
Many oxen are come about me: fat bulls of Basan close me in on every side.
They gape upon me with their mouths: as it were a ramping and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart also in the
midst of my body is even like melting wax.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my gums: and
thou shalt bring me into the dust of death.
For many dogs are come about me: and the council of the wicked layeth siege
against me.
They pierced my hands and my feet; I may tell all my bones: they stand staring
and looking upon me.
They part my garments among them: and casts lots upon my vesture.
But be not thou far from me, O Lord: thou art my succour, haste thee to help me.
Deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth: thou hast heard me also from among the horns of
the unicorns.
I will declare thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I
praise thee.
O praise the Lord, ye that fear him: magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob, and
fear him, all ye seed of Israel.
For he hath not despised, nor abhorred, the low estate of the poor: he hath not
hid his face from him, but when he called unto him he heard him.
My praise is of thee in the great congregation: my vows will I perform in the
sight of them that fear him.
The poor shall eat and be satisfied: they that seek after the Lord shall praise him;
your heart shall live for ever.
All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned unto the
Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him.
For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the Governor among the people.
All such as be fat upon earth: have eaten and worshipped.
All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him: and no man hath
quickened his own soul.
My seed shall serve him: they shall be counted unto the Lord for a generation.
They shall come, and the heavens shall declare his righteousness: unto a people
that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.
<h3>Psalm 22</h3>
A psalm of David
THE Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside the waters of
comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness, for
his Name's sake.
Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort me.
Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble me: thou hast
anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.
But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
<h3>Psalm 23</h3>
A psalm of David on the first day of the week
THE earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and
they that dwell therein.
For he hath founded it upon the seas: and prepared it upon the floods.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall rise up in his holy place?
Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart: and that hath not lift up his
mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord: and righteousness from the God of
his salvation.
This is the generation of them that seek him: even of them that seek thy face, O
Jacob.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: it is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty
in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: even the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.

And  whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but  unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven.

The sacred Confessor <i class="name">Photius</i> cried out: I will not sacrifice to idols, neither do I fear death or physical tortures, for I confess One God known in the Trinity.

Thy life was made illustrious by abstinence, and thy suffering confirmed this, O divinely-wise one, for thou hast openly glorified Christ, proclaiming: “O God of our fathers, Blessed art Thou”.  Girding thyself with manliness and the purity of chastity, thou hast obtained by grace the radiant crown of Confession, O God-pleasing Father <i class="name">Photius</i>, crying: “Blessed art Thou, God of our Fathers”.

Thou hast shone forth unto the Church of Christ, like light from a great sun, illumining the thoughts of the faithful; now making thine abode in the never-fading light, thou dost sing the Trisagion hymn unto the Uncreated Trinity.  The earth hath been adorned with thy holy tomb and with thy sacred relics, O all-praised <i class="name">Photius</i>, and the souls of the righteous rejoiced when the Angels received thy spirit, O blessed one; with them remember us who hymn thee.

        <h3>THE EPISTLE OF ST. PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS (6:10-17)</h3><p>Brethren: be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might Put on the whole 
armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we 
wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against 
the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 
Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand 
in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt 
about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod 
with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, 
wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the 
helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:

<h3>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE (12, 8-12)</h3><p>The Lord said: I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall 
the Son of man also confess before the Angels of God: But he that denieth me before 
men shall be denied before the Angels of God. And whosoever shall speak a word 
against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth 
against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven. And when they bring you unto the 
synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing 
ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same 
hour what ye ought to say.

        <h3>The Reading from the Book of Exodus (20:12-18).</h3><p>The Lord said unto Moses: Come up to Me into the mount and be there; and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written that thou mayest teach them. And Moses and his minister Joshua rose up and went up into the mount of God, and Moses said unto the elders: Tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you; and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. And the glory of the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And the seventh day the Lord called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. And Moses went into the midst of the cloud and gat him up into the mount; and was in the mount forty days and forty nights.</p><h3>The Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy. (4:1,6-15).</h3><p> Moses said unto the people: Now hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them, that ye may live. Keep therefore and do them;3 for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of thenations, which shall hear all these statutes and say: surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon Him for. And now take heed to yourselves, all ye the house of Israel, and keep your souls diligently, lest ye forget the things which your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your hearts all the days of your life. But teach them your sons and your sons' sons, specially the day that ye stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me: Gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children. .And ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds and thick darkness. And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude, only ye heard a voice. And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform. Aid the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that ye might do them in the land. The Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.</p><h3>The Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy (5:1-7,9,10,23-26,28; 6:1,2,4,5,13,18).</h3><p>Moses called all Israel, and said unto them: Hear, O Israel the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them and keep and do them: The Lord God made a covenant with you in Horeb, not with your fathers alone did the Lord make His covenant, but with you also. The Lord talked face to face in Horeb out of the midst of the fire, and I stood between the Lord and you at that time to declare unto you the words of the Lord saying: I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; there are no others gods beside Me, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments. And it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of fire, and the mountain did burn with fire, that ye all came near unto me,and ye said: Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed us His glory, and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God doth talk with man and he liveth. Now, why should we die? for this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die. For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the Lord speaking out of the midst of the fire, and liveth? And the Lord heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke unto me, and I said unto you all the commandments, the statutes and the judgments which the Lord commanded you that ye might fear all His statutes, that He may be merciful unto you and that ye may increase in the land. Hear, Israel, the Lord your God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy thought, with all thy heart, with all thy soul and with all thy might; thou shalt fear Him and serve Him alone, cleave unto Him, thou shalt swear by His name and shalt do that which is good in His sight, that it may be well with thee.

<h3>Psalm 24</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my trust in thee: O
let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.
For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed: but such as transgress
without a cause shall be put to confusion.
Shew me thy ways, O Lord: and teach me thy paths.
Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God of my salvation; in
thee hath been my hope all the day long.
Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender mercies: and thy loving-kindnesses,
which have been ever of old.
O remember not the sins and offences of my youth: but according to thy mercy
think thou upon me, O Lord, for thy goodness.
Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Them that are meek shall he guide in judgement: and such as are gentle, them
shall he learn his way.
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth: unto such as keep his covenant
and his testimonies.
For thy Name's sake, O Lord: be merciful unto my sin, for it is great.
What man is he that feareth the Lord: him shall he teach in the way that he shall
choose.
His soul shall dwell at ease: and his seed shall inherit the land.
The secret of the Lord is among them that fear him: and he will show them his
covenant.
Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out of the
net.
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am desolate and in misery.
The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my troubles.
Look upon my adversity and misery: and forgive me all my sin.
Consider mine enemies, how many they are: and they bear a tyrannous hate
against me.
O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be confounded, for I have put my
trust in thee.
Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me: for my hope hath been in
thee.
Deliver Israel, O God: out of all his troubles.
<h3>Psalm 25</h3>
A psalm of David
BE THOU my judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently: my trust hath been
also in the Lord, therefore shall I not fall.
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me: try out my reins and my heart.
For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes: and I will walk in thy truth.
I have not dwelt with vain persons: neither will I have fellowship with the
deceitful.
I have hated the congregation of the wicked: and will not sit among the ungodly.
I will wash my hands in innocency, O Lord: and so will I go to thine altar.
That I may show the voice of thanksgiving: and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house: and the place where thine honour
dwelleth.
O shut not up my soul with the sinners: nor my life with the blood-thirsty.
In whose hands is wickedness: and their right hand is full of gifts.
But as for me, I will walk innocently: O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.
My foot standeth right: I will praise the Lord in the congregations.
<h3>Psalm 26</h3>
A psalm of David before he was anointed
THE Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom then shall I fear: the Lord is the
strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my
flesh: they stumbled and fell.
Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid:
and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.
One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may dwell
in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of
the Lord, and to visit his temple.
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle: yea, in the secret
place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone.
And now shall he lift up mine head: above mine enemies round about me.
Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness: I will sing,
and speak praises unto the Lord.
Hearken unto my voice, O Lord, when I cry unto thee: have mercy upon me, and
hear me.
My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: Thy face, Lord, will I seek.
O hide not thou thy face from me: nor cast thy servant away in displeasure.
Thou hast been my succour: leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me: the Lord taketh me up.
Teach me the way, O Lord: and lead in the right way, because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: for there are false
witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.
I should utterly have fainted: but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the
Lord in the land of the living.
O tarry thou the Lord's leisure: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart ; and
put thou thy trust in the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 27</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee will I cry, O Lord my strength: think no scorn of me; lest, if thou
make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go down into the
pit.
Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee: when I hold up my
hands towards the mercy-seat of thy holy temple.
O pluck me not away, neither destroy me, with the ungodly and wicked doers:
which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mischief in their
hearts.
Reward them according to their deeds: and according to the wickedness of their
own inventions.
Recompense them after the work of their hands: pay them that they have
deserved.
For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his
hands: therefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.
Praised be the Lord: for he hath heard the voice of my humble petitions.
The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and I am
helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise
him.
The Lord is my strength: and he is the wholesome defence of his Anointed.
O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: feed them , and
set them up for ever.
<h3>Psalm 28</h3>
A psalm of David on the occasion of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle
BRING unto the Lord, O ye mighty, bring young rams unto the Lord: ascribe unto
the Lord worship and strength.
Give the Lord the honour due unto his Name: worship the Lord with holy
worship.
It is the Lord that commandeth the waters: it is the glorious God that maketh the
thunder.
It is the Lord that ruleth the sea; the voice of the Lord is mighty in operation: the
voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar-trees: yea, the Lord breaketh the
cedars of Libanus.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf: Libanus also, and Sirion, like a young
unicorn.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the Lord shaketh
the wilderness: yea, the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Cades.
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and discovereth the
thick bushes: in his temple doth every man speak of his honour.
The Lord sitteth above the water -flood: and the Lord remaineth a King for ever.
The Lord shall give strength unto his people: the Lord shall give his people the
blessing of peace.
<h3>Psalm 29</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song at the dedication of the house of David
I WILL magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up: and not made my foes to
triumph over me.
O Lord my God, I cried unto thee: and thou hast healed me.
Thou, Lord, hast brought my soul out of hell: thou hast kept my life from them
that go down to the pit.
Sing praises unto the Lord, O ye saints of his: and give thanks unto him for a
remembrance of his holiness.
For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his pleasure is life:
heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: thou, Lord, of thy
goodness hast made my hill so strong.
Thou didst turn thy face from me: and I was troubled.
Then cried I unto thee, O Lord: and gat me to my Lord right humbly.
What profit is there in my blood: when I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust give thanks unto thee: or shall it declare thy truth?
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.
Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and
girded me with gladness.
Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing: O my God, I
will give thanks unto thee for ever.

<h3>Psalm 30</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David; an utterance of extreme fear
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion, deliver
me in thy righteousness.
Bow down thine ear to me: make haste to deliver me.
And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence: that thou mayest save me.
For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: be thou also my guide, and lead me
for thy Name's sake.
Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my
strength.
Into thy hands I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou
God of truth.
I have hated them that hold of superstitious vanities: and my trust hath been in
the Lord.
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble, and
hast known my soul in adversities.
Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: but hast set my feet in a
large room.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord , for I am in trouble: and mine eye is consumed for
very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.
For my life is waxen old with heaviness: and my years with mourning.
My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity: and my bones are consumed.
I became a reproof among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours: and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me; and they
that did see me without conveyed themselves from me.
I am clean forgotten, as a dead man out of mind: I am become like a broken
vessel.
For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude: and fear is on every side, while
they conspire together against me, and take their counsel to take away my
life.
But my hope hath been in thee, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my God.
My time is in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies: and from
them that persecute me.
Shew thy servant the light of thy countenance: and save me for thy mercy's sake.
Let me not be confounded, O Lord for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be
put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.
Let the lying lips be put to silence: which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully,
speak against the righteous.
O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee:
and that thou hast prepared for them that put their trust in thee, even
before the sons of men!
Thou shalt hide them privily by thine own presence from the provoking of all
men: thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle from the strife of
tongues.
Thanks be to the Lord: for he hath shewed me marvellous great kindness in a
strong city.
And when I made haste, I said: I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.
Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer: when I cried unto thee.
26.O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth them that are
faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.
Be strong, and he shall establish your heart: all that ye put your trust in the
Lord.
<h3>Psalm 31</h3>
A psalm of instruction by David
BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven: and whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no sin: and in whose spirit
there is no guile.
For while I held my tongue: my bones consumed away through my daily
complaining.
For thy hand is heavy upon me day and night: and my moisture is like the
drought in summer.
I will acknowledge my sin unto thee: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.
I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord: and so thou forgavest the wickedness
of my sin.
For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a time when
thou mayest be found: but in the great water-floods they shall not come
nigh him.
Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shalt preserve me from trouble: thou shalt
compass me about with songs of deliverance.
I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go: and I will
guide thee with mine eyes.
Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding: whose mouths
must be held with bit and bridle. lest they fall upon thee.
Great plagues remain for the ungodly: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord,
mercy embraceth him on every side.
Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord: and be joyful, all ye that are true
of heart.

<h3>Psalm 32</h3>
A psalm of David
REJOICE in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to be thankful.
Praise the Lord with harp: sing praises unto him with the lute, and instrument of
ten strings.
Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing praises lustily unto him with a good
courage.
For the word of the Lord is true: and all his works are faithful.
He loveth righteousness and judgement: the earth is full of the goodness of the
Lord.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the hosts of them by the
breath of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap: and layeth
up the deep, as in a treasure-house.
Let all the earth fear the Lord: stand in awe of him, all ye that dwell in the world.
For he spake, and it was done: he commanded and it stood fast.
The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: and maketh the devices
of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the counsels of princes.
The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever: and the thoughts of his heart from
generation to generation.
Blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord Jehovah: and blessed are the folk,
that he hath chosen to him to be his inheritance.
The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the children of men: from the
habitation of his dwelling he considereth all them that dwell on the earth.
He fashioneth all the hearts of them: and understandeth all their works.
There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host: neither is any
mighty man delivered by much strength.
A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man: neither shall he deliver any
man by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him: and upon them that put
their trust in his mercy.
To deliver their soul from death: and to feed them in the time of dearth.
Our soul hath patiently tarried for the Lord: for he is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in him: because we have hoped in his holy Name.
Let thy merciful kindness, O Lord, be upon us: like as we do put our trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 33</h3>
A psalm of David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech, and he was dismissed
and departed
I WILL alway give thanks unto the Lord: his praise shall ever be in my mouth.
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be
glad.
O praise the Lord with me: and let us magnify his Name together.
I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he delivered me out of all my fear.
They had an eye unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
ashamed.
Lo, the poor crieth, and the Lord heareth him: yea, and saveth him out of all his
troubles.
The angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him: and delivereth
them.
O taste, and see, how gracious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusteth in
him.
O fear the Lord, ye that are his saints: for they that fear him lack nothing.
The lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they who seek the Lord shall want no
manner of thing that is good.
Come, ye children, and hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
What man is he that lusteth to live: and would fain see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil: and thy lips, that they speak no guile.
Eschew evil, and do good: seek peace, and ensue it.
The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous: and his ears are open unto their
prayers.
The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil: to root out the
remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them: and delivereth them out of all
their troubles.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and will save such as be
of an humble spirit.
Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of all.
He keepeth all his bones: so that not one of them is broken.
But misfortune shall slay the ungodly: and they that hate the righteous shall be
desolate.
The Lord delivereth the souls of his servants: and all they that put their trust in
him shall not be destitute.

<h3>Psalm 34</h3>
A psalm of David
PLEAD thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: and fight thou
against them that fight against me.
Lay hand upon the shield and buckler: and stand up to help me.
Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto
my soul, I am thy salvation.
Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seek after my soul :let them be
turned back and brought to confusion, that imagine mischief for me.
Let them be as the dust before the wind: and the angel of the Lord scattering
them.
Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord persecute them.
For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause: yea, even
without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.
Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net, that he hath laid
privily, catch himself: that he may fall into his own mischief.
And, my soul, be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, who deliverest the poor from
him that is too strong for him: yea, the poor, and him that is in misery, from
him that spoileth him?
False witnesses did rise up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
They rewarded me evil for good: to the great discomfort of my soul.
Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with
fasting.: and my prayer shall turn into mine own bosom.
I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother: I went heavily,
as one that mourneth for his mother.
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the
very abjects came together against me unawares, making mouths at me,
and ceased not.
With the flatterers were busy mockers: who gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, how long wilt though look upon this: O deliver my soul from the calamities
which they bring on me, and my darling from the lions.
So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among
much people.
O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly: neither let them
wink with their eyes that they hate me without a cause.
And why? their communing is not for peace; but they imagine deceitful words
against them that are quiet in the land.
They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said: Fie on thee, fie on thee, we
saw it with our eyes.
This thou hast seen, O Lord: hold not thy tongue then, go not far from me, O
Lord.
Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel: avenge thou my cause, my God, and
my Lord.
Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness: and let them not
triumph over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, There, there, so would we have it: neither let
them say, We have devoured him.
Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at my trouble: let
them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that boast themselves against
me.
Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing: yea, let them say
alway, Blessed be the Lord, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
servant.
And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness: and of thy praise
all the day long.
<h3>Psalm 35</h3>
For the end. By David the servant of the Lord
MY HEART sheweth me the wickedness of the ungodly: that there is no fear of
God before his eyes.
For he flattereth himself in his own sight: until his abominable sin be found out.
The words of his mouth are unrighteous, and full of deceit: he hath left off to
behave himself wisely, and to do good.
He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good way:
neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.
Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth unto the heavens: and thy faithfulness unto the
clouds.
Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: thy judgments are like the
great deep.
Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast; How excellent is thy mercy, O God:
and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy
wings.
They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house: and thou shalt give
them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.
For with thee is the well of life: and in thy light shall we see light.
O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee: and thy
righteousness unto them that are true of heart.
O let not the foot of pride come against me: and let not the hand of the ungodly
cast me down.
There are they fallen, all that work wickedness: they are cast down, and shall not
be able to stand.

<h3>Psalm 36</h3>
A psalm of David
FRET not thyself because of the ungodly: neither be thou envious against the
evil-doers.
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass: and be withered even as the
green herb.
Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good: dwell in the land, and verily
thou shalt be fed.
Delight thou in the Lord: and he shall give thee thy heart's desire.
Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him: and he shall bring it to
pass.
He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light ; and thy just dealing as the
noon-day.
Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon him: but grieve not thyself at
him whose way doth prosper, against the man that doeth after evil
counsels.
Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: fret not thyself, else shalt thou be
moved to do evil.
Wicked doers shall be rooted out: and they that patiently abide the Lord, those
shall inherit the land.
Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: thou shalt look after his
place, and he shall be away.
But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth: and shall be refreshed in the
multitude of peace.
The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just: and gnasheth upon him with his
teeth.
The Lord shall laugh him to scorn: for he hath seen that his day is coming.
The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow: to cast down
the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of a right conversation.
Their sword shall go through their own heart: and their bow shall be broken.
A small thing that the righteous hath: is better than great riches of the ungodly.
For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken: and the Lord upholdeth the
righteous.
The Lord knoweth the days of the godly: and their inheritance shall endure for
ever.
They shall not be confounded in the perilous time: and in the days of dearth they
shall have enough.
As for the ungodly, they shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord shall consume
as the fat of lambs: yea, even as the smoke shall they consume away.
The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous is merciful and
liberal.
Such as are blessed of God shall possess the land: and they that are cursed of
him shall be rooted out.
The Lord ordereth a good man's going: and maketh his way acceptable to
himself.
Though he fall, he shall not be cast away: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
hand.
I have been young, and now am old: and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging their bread.
The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth: and his seed is blessed.
Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good: and dwell for evermore.
For the Lord loveth the thing that is right: he forsaketh not his that be godly, but
they are preserved for ever.
The unrighteous shall be punished: as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be
rooted out.
The righteous shall inherit the land: and dwell therein forever.
The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and his tongue will be talking
of judgement.
The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not slide.
The ungodly seeth the righteous: and seeketh occasion to slay him.
The Lord will not leave him in his hand: nor condemn him when he is judged.
Hope thou in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee, that thou
shalt possess the land: when the ungodly shall perish, thou shalt see it.
I myself have seen the ungodly in great power: and flourishing like a green baytree.
I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him, but his place could no where be
found.
Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right: for that shall bring a
man peace at the last.
As for the transgressors, they shall perish together: and the end of the ungodly
is, they shall be rooted out at the last.
But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord: who is also their strength
in the time of trouble.
And the Lord shall stand by them, and save them: he shall deliver them from the
ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him.

    <h3>Ode I</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> Unto Him that of old hath instructed Israel running away from Pharaoh's bondage, and hath fed them in the wilderness, unto our God, the Deliverer, let us sing; for He is glorified. On the day set apart for our festival let us, O people, open our mouths and expound with our tongues the divine manifestation of Christ our God in <i class="name">Meeting</i> cheerfully singing: For He is glorified. The Light Ever-existing, carrying out the words of the Father and desiring to shew His grace, hath taken the form of a servant for our sake and manifested Himself in the manner of His divine <i class="name">Meeting</i>, highly illumining us with light. O come ye all, let us in faith celebrate Christ's <i class="name">Meeting</i>, and intelligently offering the divine melody, let us glorify Him and vociferate harmoniously: Christ is come
    unto the restoration of the darkened. Let us sing unto Him, for He is glorified.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> This day's manifestation of the birth of the God incarnate we have truly learned through thee, O all-pure one, and honouring thee were accounted worthy to behold <i class="name">Meeting</i> of thy Son; Whom supplicate to save us from every danger.</p>
    <p><i class="note">For Katavasia:</i> Covered with divine darkness, the one slow of speech hath proclaimed the God-written law, for, having thrown the mire off his mental eye, he doth see the Existing One and ac- quireth knowledge of the Spirit, praising with divine songs.</p>
    <h3>Ode III</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> Neither in wisdom, nor in power and riches we glory, but in Thee,O Christ, the Hypo static Wisdom of the Father, for there is no one moreholy than Thou art, O Lover of man. Master by nature, Thou, O Christ, didst unite Thyself untoThy servants and becamest visible, working for us various forms of salvation which we now glorify in Thy <i class="name">Meeting</i>, for there is no one more holy than Thou art, O Lover of man. Thy people, O Christ, who are enlightened by the faith in Thee, brightly celebrate Thy divine festival <i class="name">Meeting</i>; honouring which we get delivered from dangers; vouchsafe unto us, O Saviour, the Kingdom of heaven also. O Life Hypostatical ! Having now tasted of death in the flesh and thereby made life to flow unto the dead, Thou hast, O Christ, granted us as meditator of life Thine awaking and Thy <i class="name">Meeting</i>.
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> The salvation hath before shone forth in the flesh out of thee in the world, and now unto the faithful through thee, O God's Mother, the life appeared in Christ's light-bearing <i class="name">Meeting</i> ; for the sake thereof do, O Theotokos, supplicate thy Son to deliver us from dangers and from everlasting torments.
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia: The fetters of the childless womb, and the unbearable insults from a</i> fruitful foe have of old been done away with in the case of Anna the prophetess solely by her prayer, brought with an afflicted spirit unto the Mighty One and God of wisdom.
    <p><i class="note">The Sessional Hymn, Tone IV:</i></p><p><i class="note">Spec. Mel.: "Thou that wastlifted up on the cross..."</i></p>
    <p>We implore Thee, O Master and Merciful Saviour, to deliver from all enemies both visible and invisible, from incursions of other nations and from all manner of dangers and confusion, us who in faith and with love celebrate Thy divine <i class="name">Meeting</i> ; for the sake thereof do vouchsafe that we may obtain the enjoyment of eternal good things. <p>Glory ..., Now & Ever ...,</p> We implore Thee, O Master and Merciful Saviour, to deliver from all enemies both visible and invisible, from incursions of other nations and from all manner of dangers and confusion, us who in faith and with love celebrate Thy divine <i class="name">Meeting</i> ; for the sake thereof do vouchsafe that we may obtain the enjoyment of eternal good things.</p>
    <h3>Ode IV</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p>Perceiving the unfathomable divine council with regard to the incarnation from the virgin of Thee, the High One, the prophet Habbakuk called out: Glory to Thy might, O Lord. The divine festival of One Who in the flesh drew so near unto men, as a light hath come to the newly elected Israel and enlighteneth to day the ends of the whole world by His <i class="name">Meeting</i>: Glory to Thy might, O Lord. Having been illumined, Moses was of old made worthy to see God's glory in Thy signs, and the new Israel doth now behold Thee, the Deliverer, clearly face to face: Glory to Thy might, O Lord. Behold, all ye people, the wonderful things, rejoice now in spirit, hymning <i class="name">Meeting</i> of Christ, Who hath appeared on earth unto men for their salvation: Glory to Thy might, O Lord.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O most pure Theotokos, save us that flee unto thee and celebrate Thy Son's divine <i class="name">Meeting</i>, and always supplicate Him to grant us remission of sins.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia:</i> O King of Kings, Sole from the only One, the Only Word of the Uncaused Father, Thou in Thy bounty hast truly sent down Thy Co-equal in might Spirit upon the apostles that hymn Thee: Glory to Thy might, O Lord.</p>
    <h3>Ode V</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> Thou Who hast dispersed the primordiate light that the works may in the light hymn Thee, O Christ, as the Creator, do in Thy light direct our paths. Let us to-day clap our hands and shout with our voices the praises of the Lord, for, behold, He hath truly appeared, enlightening all the faithful with the divine <i class="name">Meeting</i> of His most pure body. The assemblies of the faithful are to-day enlightened and the bands of heretics put to shame at the sight of the adoration of <i class="name">Meeting</i> of Christ, the Deliverer having assumed the bodily form. The festivity is come and the great mystery hath shone forth light from the countenance of the Lord in the well-arranged festival of the divine <i class="name">Meeting</i> of the Lord, for therewithal were granted unto all the captives peace and joy.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> Let the clouds drop sweetness from above unto the earthly, at thine intercession, O most holy Virgin; having taken compassion of the world, thy Son and our God hath to-day raised the horn of the Christians ; to-day hath He granted salvation unto the faithful by his divine <i class="name">Meeting</i>. </p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia:</i> O ye, illustrious children of the church ! Receive the fire-breathing dew of the Spirit for the perfect purification of sins, for now from Zion hath gone forth the law - the grace of the Spirit in the shape of the tongues of fire.</p>
    <h3>Ode VI</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p>Celebrating this divine and all-honourable feast of the Mother of God, come ye Godly- wise, let us clap our hands, glorifying the God that was born of her. Life hath shone forth unto the dead, and light hath come unto those that were already blind, and unto those grievously afflicted hath sprung up a cure, and salvation hath come nigh unto all through the lightbearing <i class="name">Meeting</i> of Christ. Let every intelligence rejoice, now clearly seeing the spiritual festival of the divine <i class="name">Meeting</i>, which doth shed enlightenment unto those that adore Him. O Lord, the heavens, seeing Thee, declare Thy glory, O Jesus Christ, they call together all Thy faithful to the hymning of Thy divine <i class="name">Meeting</i>, and those that are to come unto the knowledge of true repentance. </p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> O Mother of God ! there appeared unto the nations a sign and sure salvation, O pure Virgin, in the light of the honoured <i class="name">Meeting</i> of Thy Son; Him supplicate to save us that recall Thee, and deliver from dangers and incursions of pagans with thine interces- sions. </p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia:</i> O Christ! Thou hast shone forth from the Virgin unto us, O Master, as propitiation and salvation, that, just as once the prophet Jonah out of the belly of a sea-monster, Thou mightest rescue from corruption Adam, fallen with all his race.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Kontakion, in Tone II:</i> O uncircumscribed Word of the Father! knowing Thine undrawn by hand, but God-made icon to be the trophy of Thine ineffable and divine economy respecting men and of Thine undoubted incarnation, we honour Thee in kissing it.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Ikos:</i> Giving assurance unto men of the mystery of His incarnation, the Lord becometh Himself circumscribed by His God-and-man form; the Archetype thereof doth He seat on the Father's throne to be worshipped of the bodiless angels, and the adoration of an image of the Archetype hath He granted unto us; which embracing with our souls and hearts, we honour Him in kissing it.</p>
    <h3>Ode VII</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> The Abrahamic youths have once in Babylon trodden under their feet the flame of the furnace, calling out in songs: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou. Every city and country rejoice together with the new Zion in faithful celebration; for the King of her glory, Christ, hath come in the form of His venerable festival <i class="name">Meeting</i> and saveth those that adore Him and vociferate: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou. The sayings of the God-voiced prophets have been fulfilled in the Holy Scriptures, for now we see the accomplishment in Christ's <i class="name">Meeting</i>; thereby is the world enlightened and with its brilliant shine are saved those that sing: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou. </p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> With the earthly the heavenly are rejoicing, and the multitude of all the saints participate in the rejoicings; both the kings and princes, the rich and poor * we are all celebrating; for Christ hath prepared for us an enlightenment in the picture of His festival ** the god-effecting similitude which He hath received from the Virgin.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia :</i> Harmoniously have once resounded the instruments in honour of the golden-made, lifeless idol, and the light-bearing grace of the Comforter doth animate to the vociferation: O Sole Trinity, equal in might, unoriginate, blessed art Thou.
    <h3>Ode VIII</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos:</i></p><p> The youths in Babylon, burning with the divine zeal, have manfully scorned both the tyrant and the flame, and being thrown into the midst of the fire, but bedewed, sung : Bless the Lord, all ye the works of the Lord. Being perfect God by nature, Thou wast seen a perfect man also, preserving in both natures their properties, and as God giving assurance of the divine <i class="name">Meeting</i> in the flesh; Him adoring we sing: Bless the Lord, all ye the works of the Lord. Exalt the horn, O Word of God, of those who confess Thee to be God and man and who glorify Thy <i class="name">Meeting</i>, wherewith Thou hast vouchsafed unto all the faithful the life eternal and made of no effect the rage of the pagans, haters of Thy divine might. The new law shineth and the church is adorned, for the lightof Thy divine glory, O Christ the God, hath gone forth and manifested Thy light-like countenance in Thy <i class="name">Meeting</i> unto the salvation of Thy people that vociferate unto Thee: Bless the Lord, all ye the works of the Lord. </p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> O Thou, restoration of the fallen, joy of the despairing, instructress of those gone astray, healer of the sick and salvation for all Christians - do preserve, O Sovereign-Lady Theotokos, us that honour <i class="name">Meeting</i> of Thy Son; supplicate of Him that we may be delivered from the incursions of foreign nations.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia: The triply-shining form of Godhead looseth the chains and bedeweth</i> the flame; the youths hymn and the whole creation blesseth the Only Saviour and Maker as Benefactor.</p>
    <h3>Ode IX</h3>
    <p><i class="note">The Irmos :</i></p><p> Thy bringing forth hath proved incorrupt : God hath passed out of thy loins, as flesh-bearer did He appear on earth and hath lived among men ; wherefore we all magnify thee, O Theotokos. Let us sing an ode of thanksgiving unto the Lord who was pleased to grant us exceedingly abundant riches in <i class="name">Meeting</i> of His divine flesh which in battles affordeth so strong a support and honouring which we the faithful magnify Thee. O the wonders above understanding which Thou, O Lord, hast made for us that trust in Thee! For just as <i class="name">Meeting</i> was, Thou hast ineffably and awfully shown unto all the image thereof; do deliver those that honour it, from every anger and fall. O Word of God, Wisdom and Might and Image of the Father! O God comprehensible! Do make us worthy to accomplish the joyful celebration of Thy festival <i class="name">Meeting</i> in the light of good works, spiritually magnifying Thee.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Thetokion:</i> Truly thy height, O most pure one, is that of the mystery of God and the depth that of the divine and ineffable wisdom. For the Most High was unspeakably born of thee and the Invisible One became Visible in His fleshly <i class="name">Meeting</i>; adoring which we the faithful magnify thee.</p>
    <p><i class="note">Katavasia: Hail thou, O Queen, the glory of both mother and maiden, for no</i> mouth, however fluent and well-spoken, can be so eloquent as worthily to hymn thee, and every mind faileth to comprehend thy bringing forth; wherefore we with one voice glorify thee.</p>

<h3>Psalm 37</h3>
A psalm of David . For remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day
PUT me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy heavy
displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me: and thy hand presseth me sore.
There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure: neither is there any
rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.
For my wickednesses are gone over my head: and are like a sore burden, too
heavy for me to bear.
My wounds stink, and are corrupt: through my foolishness.
I am brought into so great trouble and misery: that I go mourning all the day
long.
For my loins are filled with a sore disease: and there is no whole part in my body.
I am feeble, and sore smitten: I have roared for the very disquietness of my
heart.
Lord, thou knowest all my desire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me: and the sight of mine eyes is gone
from me.
My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble: and my
kinsmen stood afar off.
They also that sought after my life laid snares for me: and they that went about
to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit all the day long.
As for me I was like a deaf men, and heard not: and as one that is dumb, who
doth not open his mouth.
I became even as a man that heareth not: and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my
God.
I have required that they, even mine enemies should not triumph over me: for
when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me.
And I, truly, am set in the plague: and my heaviness is ever in my sight.
For I will confess my wickedness: and be sorry for my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are mighty: and they that hate me wrongfully are
many in number.
They also that reward evil for good are against me: because I follow the thing
that good is.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me.
Haste thee to help me: O Lord God of my salvation.
<h3>Psalm 38</h3>
For the end. A song of David, for Idithun
I SAID, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not in my tongue.
I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle: while the ungodly is in my sight.
I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even from good words;
but it was pain and grief to me.
My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire kindled: and at
the last I spake with my tongue;
Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may be certified
how long I have to live.
Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long: and mine age is even as
nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is altogether vanity.
For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth
up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.
And now, Lord, what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.
Deliver me from all mine offences: and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.
I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.
Take thy plague away from me: I am even consumed by the means of thy heavy
hand.
When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to
consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man
therefore is but vanity.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling: hold not thy
peace at my tears.
For I am a stranger with thee: and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence, and be no
more seen
<h3>Psalm 39</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
I WAITED patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and heard my calling.
He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay: and set my
feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth: even a thanksgiving unto our God.
Many shall see it, and fear: and shall put their trust in the Lord.
Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the Lord: and turned not unto the
proud, and to such as go about with lies.
O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like as be
also thy thoughts which are to us-ward: and yet there is no man that
ordereth them unto thee:
If I should declare them, and speak of them: they should be more than I am able
to express.
Sacrifice and meat-offering thou wouldest not: but mine ears hast thou opened.
Burnt-offerings, and sacrifice for sin, hast thou not required: then said I, Lo, I
come,
In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil thy will, O my
God: I am content to do it; yea, thy law is within my heart.
I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I will not refrain
my lips, O Lord, and that thou knowest.
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart: my talk hath been of thy truth
and of thy salvation.
I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth: from the great congregation.
Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord: let thy loving-kindness and thy
truth alway preserve me.
For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such hold upon
me that I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the
hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.
O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me: make haste, O Lord, to help me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after my soul to
destroy it: let them be driven backward and put to rebuke, that wish me
evil.
Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame: that say unto me, Fie upon
thee, fie upon thee.
Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let such as love thy
salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and needy: but the Lord careth for me.
Thou art my helper and redeemer: make no long tarrying, O my God.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 40</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him
in the time of trouble.
The Lord preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth:
and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.
The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick upon his bed: make thou all his bed in
his sickness.
I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies speak evil of me: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: and his heart conceiveth falsehood
within himself, and when he cometh forth he telleth it.
All mine enemies whisper together against me: even against me do they imagine
this evil.
Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him: and now that he lieth, let him
rise up no more.
Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted: who did also eat of my
bread, hath laid great wait for me.
But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord: raise thou me up again, and I shall reward
them.
By this I know thou favourest me: that mine enemy doth not triumph against me.
And when I am in my health, thou upholdest me: and shalt set me before thy face
for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: world without end. Amen.
<h3>Psalm 41</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: when shall I come to
appear before the presence of God?
My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where
is now thy God?
Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the
multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;
In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day.
Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted
within me?
Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his
countenance.
My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore will I remember thee concerning
the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermon.
One deep calleth another, because of the noise of the water-pipes: all thy waves
and storms are gone over me.
The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time: and in the nightseason did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me: why go I
thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword: while mine enemies that trouble
me cast me in the teeth;
Namely, while they say daily unto me: Where is now thy God?
Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.
<h3>Psalm 42</h3>
A psalm of David
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people:
O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.
For thou art the God of my strength, why hast thou put me from thee: and why
go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me: and bring me unto thy
holy hill, and to thy dwelling.
And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and
gladness: and upon the harp I will give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 43</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
WE HAVE heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us: what thou hast
done in their time of old;
How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted them in: how
thou hast destroyed the nations and cast them out.
For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword: neither was it
their own arm that helped them;
But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance: because
thou hadst a favour unto them.
Thou art my King, O God: send help unto Jacob.
Through thee will we overthrow our enemies: and in thy Name will we tread
them under, that rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow: it is not my sword that shall help me;
But it is thou that savest us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion that
hate us.
We make our boast of God all day long: and will praise thy Name for ever.
But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion: and goest not forth with our
armies.
Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies: so that they which hate us
spoil our goods.
Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep: and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Thou sellest thy people for nought: and takest no money for them.
Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours: to be laughed to scorn, and had
in derision of them that are round about us.
Thou makest us to be a by-word among the heathen: and that the people shake
their heads at us.
My confusion is daily before me: and the shame of my face hath covered me;
For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer: for the enemy and avenger.
And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee: nor behave
ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.
Our heart is not turned back: neither our steps gone out of thy way;
No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons: and covered us with
the shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to any
strange God: shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very secrets of
the heart.
For thy sake also are we killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep
appointed to be slain.
Up, Lord, why sleepest thou: awake, and be not absent from us for ever.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face: and forgettest our misery and trouble?
For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
ground.
Arise, and help us: and deliver us for thy mercy's sake.
<h3>Psalm 44</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses by the sons of Core, for instruction. A Song concerning the
beloved
MY HEART is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the thing which I have made
unto the King.
My tongue is the pen: of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, because God
hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most Mighty: according to thy
worship and renown.
Good luck have thou with thine honour: ride on, because of the word of truth , of
meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible
things.
Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be subdued unto thee: even in
the midst among the King's enemies.
Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, even thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia: out of the ivory palaces,
whereby they have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did
stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, incline thine ear ; forget also thine own
people, and thy father's house.
So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty: for his is thy Lord God, and
worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: like as the rich also among
the people shall make their supplication before thee.
The King's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work: the virgins that be
her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee.
With joy and gladness shall they be brought: and shall enter into the King's
palace.
Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children: whom thou mayest make princes
in all lands.
I will remember thy Name from one generation to another: therefore shall the
people give thanks unto thee, world without end.
<h3>Psalm 45</h3>
For the end. For the sons of Core; a psalm concerning secret things
GOD is our hope and strength: a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved: and though the hills be
carried into the midst of the sea;
Though the waters thereof rage and swell: and though the mountains shake at
the tempest of the same.
The rivers of the flood thereof shall make glad the city of God: the holy place of
the tabernacle of the most Highest.
God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed: God shall help
her, and that right early.
The heathen make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved: but God hath shewed
his voice, and the earth shall melt away.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.
O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord: what destruction he hath
brought upon the earth.
He maketh wars to cease in all the world: he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the
spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.
Be still then, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I
will be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

         </p><h3>THE READING IS FROM ISAIAH </h3><p>Thus saith the Lord: Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people  be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them  bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: our let them hear, and say, It is  truth. Ye (are) my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen:  that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I (am) he: before me there was  no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the LORD; and beside  me there is no savior. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there  was) no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that  I am God. Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of  my hand: I will work, and who shall let it? Thus saith the LORD, your Redeemer, the  Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all  their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. Thus saith the Lord. The  Holy One of Israel </p><h3>THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON </h3><p>The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God, and there shall no torment  touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die, and their departure is  taken for misery, and their going from us to be utter destruction, but they are in  peace. For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of  immortality. And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded, for  God proved them and found them worthy for Himself. As gold in the furnace hath  He tried them, and received them as a burnt offering. And in the time of their  visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. They  shall judge the nations and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign  for ever. They that put their trust in Him shall understand the truth; and such as be  faithful in love shall abide with Him; for grace and mercy is to His saints and  visitation for His elect.  </p><h3>THE READING FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON </h3><p>Though the righteous man happen to die, yet shall he rest in peace. For honorable  age is not that which is so for a length of time, nor that which is measured by the  number of years. But wisdom and a spotless life to a ripe old age is the true gray hair  of a man. He pleased God, and was beloved of Him, so that living among sinners he  was taken away. Yea, speedily was he taken up, lest wickedness should pervert his  understanding, or deceit beguile his soul. For the beguilement of transgression doth  obscure things that are good, and the wanderings of lust doth undermine the  innocent mind. Made perfect in a short time, he fulfilled many years; for his soul  pleased the Lord; therefore the Lord hastened to take him away from among the  wicked. This the people saw, and did not understand, neither did they lay this up in  their hearts, that grace and mercy is with His saints, and that the Lord doth visit His  chosen ones.

For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O CLAP your hand together, all ye people: O sing unto God with the voice of
melody.
For the Lord is high, and to be feared: he is the great King upon all the earth.
He shall subdue the people under us: and the nations under our feet.
He shall choose out an heritage for us: even the worship of Jacob, whom he
loved.
God is gone up with a merry noise: and the Lord with the sound of the trump.
O sing praises, sing praises unto our God: O sing praises, sing praises unto our
King.
For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon his holy seat.
The princes of the people are joined unto the people of the God of Abraham: for
God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the earth, as it were with a
shield.
<h3>Psalm 47</h3>
A psalm of praise for the sons of Core on the second day of the week
GREAT is the Lord, and highly to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his
holy hill.
The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth: upon the north-side
lieth the city of the great King; God is well known in her palaces as a sure
refuge.
For lo, the kings of the earth: are gathered, and gone by together.
They marvelled to see such things: they were astonished, and suddenly cast
down.
Fear came there upon them, and sorrow: as upon a woman in her travail.
Thou shalt break the ships of the sea: through the east wind.
Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the
city of our God: God upholdeth the same for ever.
We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God: in the midst of thy temple.
O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's end: thy right
hand is full of righteousness.
Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad: because of thy
judgements.
Walk about Sion, and go round about her: and tell the towers thereof.
Mark well her bulwarks, set up her houses: that ye may tell them that come
after.
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he shall be our guide unto death.
<h3>Psalm 48</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O HEAR ye this, all ye people: ponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the
world;
High and low, rich and poor: one with another.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom: and my heart shall muse of understanding.
I will incline mine ear to the parable: and shew my dark speech upon the harp.
Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness: and when the wickedness of
my heels compasseth me round about?
There be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches.
But no man may deliver his brother: nor make agreement unto God for him;
For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that alone for ever;
Yea, though he live long: and see not the grave.
For he seeth that wise men also die, and perish together: as well as the ignorant
and foolish, and leave their riches for other.
And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever: and that their
dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the
lands after their own names.
Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour: seeing that he may be compared
unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them.
This is their foolishness: and their posterity praise their saying.
They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and the righteous shall
have domination over them in the morning: their beauty shall consume in
the sepulchre out of their dwelling.
But God hath delivered my soul from the place of hell: for he shall receive me.
Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich: or if the glory of his house be
increased.
For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth: neither shall his pomp
follow him.
For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man: and so long as thou doest
well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.
He shall follow the generation of his fathers: and shall never see light.
Man being in honour hath no understanding: but is compared unto the beasts
that perish.

<h3>Psalm 49</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
THE Lord, even the most mighty God, hath spoken: and called the world, from
the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Out of Sion hath God appeared: in perfect beauty.
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: there shall go before him a
consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up round about him.
He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth, that he may judge his people.
Gather my saints together unto me: those that have made a covenant with me
with sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is Judge himself.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak: I myself will testify against thee, O Israel;
for I am God, even thy God.
I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt-offerings:
because they were not alway before me.
I will take no bullock out of thine house: nor he-goat out of thy folds.
For all the beasts of the forest are mine: and so are the cattle upon a thousand
hills.
I know all the fowls upon the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are in
my sight.
If I be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the whole world is mine, and all that is
therein.
Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh: and drink the blood of goats?
Offer unto God thanksgiving: and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.
And call upon me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise
me.
But unto the ungodly said God: Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my
covenant in thy mouth;
Whereas thou hatest to be reformed: and has cast my words behind thee?
When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him: and hast been partaker
with the adulterers.
Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness: and with thy tongue thou hast set
forth deceit.
Thou satest, and spakest against thy brother: yea, and hast slandered thine own
mother's son.
These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest
wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and
set before thee the things that thou hast done.
O consider this, ye that forget God: lest I pluck you away, and there be none to
deliver you.
Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation right will I shew the salvation of God.
<h3>Psalm 50</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to
Bathsheba
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according to the
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.
Wash me throughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.
Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin hath my mother conceived me.
But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand
wisdom secretly.
Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice.
Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.
Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health: and
my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.
Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy praise.
For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou delightest not in
burnt-offerings.
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt
thou not despise.
O be favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burntofferings and oblations: then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine
altar.

<h3>Psalm 51</h3>
For the end. A psalm of instruction by David, when Doeg the Idumean came and told Saul that
David had gone to the house of Abimelech
WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant: that thou canst do mischief;
Whereas the goodness of God: endureth yet daily?
Thy tongue imagineth wickedness: and with lies thou cuttest like a sharp rasor.
Thou hast loved unrighteousness more then goodness: and to talk of lies more
than righteousness.
Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt: O thou false tongue.
Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever: he shall take thee, and pluck thee out
of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of the living.
The righteous also shall see this, and fear: and shall laugh him to scorn;
Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength: but trusted unto the
multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: my trust is in the
tender mercy of God for ever and ever.
I will always give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done: and I will hope in thy
Name, for thy saints like it well.
<h3>Psalm 52</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David upon Maeleth, of instruction
THE foolish body hath said in his heart: There is no God.
Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness: there is none that
doeth good.
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there were any
that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is also none that doeth good, no not one.
Are not they without understanding, that work wickedness: eating up my people
as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.
They were afraid where no fear was: for God hath broken the bones of him that
besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because God hath despised
them.
O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion: O that the Lord would
deliver his people out of captivity!
Then should Jacob rejoice: and Israel should be right glad.
<h3>Psalm 53</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of instruction by David. When the Ziphites came and said to Saul,
Lo, is not David hid with us?
SAVE me, O God, for thy Name's sake: and avenge me in thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God: and hearken unto the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me: and tyrants, which have not God before
their eyes, seek after my soul.
Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy truth.
An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O Lord: because
it is so comfortable.
For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire
upon mine enemies.
<h3>Psalm 54</h3>
For the end. Among hymns of instruction by David
HEAR my prayer, O God: and hide not thyself from my petition.
Take heed unto me, and hear me: how I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed.
The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast: for they are minded to
do me some mischief; so maliciously are they set against me.
My heart is disquieted within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me: and an horrible dread hath
overwhelmed me.
And I said, O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I flee away, and be at
rest.
Lo, then would I get me away far off: and remain in the wilderness.
I would make haste to escape: because of the stormy wind and tempest.
Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them: for I have spied unrighteousness
and strife in the city.
Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow
are in the midst of it.
Wickedness is therein: deceit and guile go not out of their streets.
For it is not an open enemy, that hath done me this dishonour: for then I could
have borne it.
Neither was it mine adversary, that did magnify himself against me: for then
peradventure I would have hid myself from him.
But it was even thou, my companion: my guide, and mine own familiar friend.
We took sweet counsel together: and walked in the house of God as friends.
Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for
wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord shall save me.
In the evening, and morning, and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly: and
he shall hear my voice.
It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
for there were many with me.
Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them down: for
they will not turn, nor fear God.
He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him: and he brake his covenant.
The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart: his
words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very swords.
O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: and shall not suffer
the righteous to fall for ever.
And as for them: thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction.
The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days:
nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.

<h3>Psalm 55</h3>
For the end. Concerning the people that were removed from the sanctuary. By David for a
memorial, when the Philistines caught him in Gath
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me: he is daily
fighting, and troubling me.
Mine enemies are daily in hand to swallow me up: for they be many that fight
against me, O thou most Highest.
Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid: yet put I my trust in thee.
I will praise God, because of his word: I have put my trust in God, and will not
fear what flesh can do unto me.
They daily mistake my words: all that they imagine is to do me evil.
They hold all together, and keep themselves close: and mark my steps, when
they lay wait for my soul.
Shall they escape for their wickedness: thou, O God, in thy displeasure shalt cast
them down.
Thou tellest my flittings; put my tears into thy bottle: are not these things noted
in thy book?
Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight: this I
know; for God is on my side.
In God's word I will rejoice: in the Lord's word will I comfort me.
Yea, in God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows: unto thee will I give thanks.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling: that I may
walk before God in the light of the living.
<h3>Psalm 56</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David, for a memorial. When he fled from the presence of Saul to
the cave
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, be merciful unto me, for my soul trusteth in
thee: and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until this
tyranny be over-past.
I will call unto the most high God: even unto the God that shall perform the
cause which I have in hand.
He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him that would eat
me up.
God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among lions.
And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are
spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they have digged a
pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, and give praise.
Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee
among the nations.
For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens: and thy truth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 57</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation: and do ye judge the
thing that is right, O ye sons of men?
Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth: and your hands deal with
wickedness.
The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb: as soon as they are
born, they go astray, and speak lies.
They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent: even like the deaf adder that
stoppeth her ears.
Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer: charm he never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; smite the jaw-bones of the lions, O
Lord: let them fall away like water that runneth apace; and when they
shoot their arrows let them be rooted out.
Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of a woman:
and let them not see the sun.
Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns: so let indignation vex him, even as a
thing that is raw.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his
footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: doubtless
there is a God that judgeth the earth.

<h3>Psalm 58</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David for a memorial, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill
him
DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God: defend me from them that rise up
against me.
O deliver me from the wicked doers: and save me from the blood-thirsty men.
For lo, they lie waiting for my soul: the mighty men are gathered against me,
without any offence or fault of me, O Lord.
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: arise thou therefore to help
me, and behold.
Stand up, O Lord God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the heathen: and be
not merciful unto them that offend of malicious wickedness.
They go to and fro in the evening: they grin like a dog, and run about through the
city.
Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips: for who doth
hear?
But thou. O Lord, shalt have them in derision: and thou shalt laugh all the
heathen to scorn.
My strength will I ascribe unto thee: for thou art the God of my refuge.
God sheweth me his goodness plenteously: and God shall let me see my desire
upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget it: but scatter them abroad among the
people, and put them down, O Lord, our defence.
For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be taken in
their pride: and why? their preaching is of cursing and lies.
Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish: and know that
it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.
And in the evening they will return: grin like a dog, and will go about the city.
They will run here and there for meat: and grudge if they be not satisfied.
As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betimes in the
morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
trouble.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my
merciful God.
<h3>Psalm 59</h3>
For the end. For them that shall yet be changed. For an inscription by David for instruction.
When he had burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syrian Sobal, and Joab had returned and smitten
twelve thousand in the Valley of Salt
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad: thou hast also been
displeased; O turn thee unto us again.
Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: heal the sores thereof, for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewed thy people heavy things: thou hast given us a drink of deadly
wine.
Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee: that they may triumph because of
the truth.
Therefore were thy beloved delivered: help me with thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Sichem: and mete out
the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head;
Judah is my law-giver.
Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, be thou glad
of me.
Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou cast us out, O God: wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
O be thou our help in trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Through God will we do great acts: for it is he that shall tread down our enemies.
<h3>Psalm 60</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of David
HEAR my crying, O God: give ear unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth will I call unto thee: when my heart is in heaviness.
O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I: for thou hast been my hope, and
a strong tower for me against the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: and my trust shall be under the covering of
thy wings.
For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires: and hast given an heritage unto those
that fear thy Name.
Thou shalt grant the King a long life: that his years may endure throughout all
generations.
He shall dwell before God for ever: O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness,
that they may preserve him.
So will I always sing praise unto thy Name: that I may daily perform my vows.

<h3>Psalm 61</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David for Idithun
MY SOUL truly waiteth still upon God: for of him cometh my salvation.
He verily is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
greatly fall.
How long will ye imagine mischief against every man: ye shall be slain all the
sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and like a broken hedge.
Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt: their delight is in
lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse with their heart.
Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God: for my hope is in him.
He truly is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
fall.
In God is my health, and my glory: the rock of my might, and in God is my trust.
O put your trust in him alway, ye people: pour out your hearts before him, for
God is our hope.
As for the children of men, they are but vanity: the children of men are deceitful
upon the weights, they are altogether lighter than vanity itself.
O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselves unto vanity: if riches
increase, set not your heart upon them.
God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same: that power belongeth
unto God;
And that thou, Lord, art merciful: for thou rewardest every man according to his
work.
<h3>Psalm 62</h3>
A psalm of David. When he was in the wilderness of Idumea
O GOD, thou art my God: early will I seek thee.
My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee: in a barren and dry
land where no water is.
Thus have I looked for thee in holiness: that I might behold thy power and glory.
For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: my lips shall praise thee.
As long as I live will I magnify thee on this manner: and lift up my hands in thy
Name.
My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness: when my
mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.
Have I not remembered thee in my bed: and thought upon thee when I was
waking?
Because thou hast been my helper: therefore under the shadow of thy wings will
I rejoice.
My soul hangeth upon thee: thy right hand hath upholden me.
These also that seek the hurt of my soul: they shall go under the earth.
Let them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be a portion for foxes.
But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him shall be
commended: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
<h3>Psalm 63</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the gathering together of the froward: and from the insurrection of
wicked doers;
Who have whet their tongue like a sword: and shoot out their arrows, even bitter
words;
That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: suddenly do they hit him, and
fear not.
They encourage themselves in mischief: and commune among themselves how
they may lay snares, and say that no man shall see them.
They imagine wickedness, and practise it: that they keep secret among
themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.
But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow: that they shall be
wounded.
Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall insomuch that whoso seeth them
shall laugh them to scorn.
And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done: for they shall perceive that
it is his work.
The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and put his trust in him: and all they that
are true of heart shall be glad.

        <h3>   THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE, (12, 2-12).  </h3><p>The Lord said, there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid,  that shall not be known. Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be  heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be  proclaimed upon the housetops. And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of  them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will  forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to  cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. Are not five sparrows sold for two  farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? But even the very hairs of  your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many  sparrows. Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the  Son of man also confess before the Angels of God: But he that denieth me before  men shall be denied before the Angels of God. And whosoever shall speak a word  against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth  against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven. And when they bring you unto the  synagogues, and (unto) </h3><p>magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what  thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the  same hour what ye ought to say.  </p>

        <h3>THE SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY (2:1-10)</h3><p>Brethren: Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things that thou 
hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who 
shall be able to teach others also. Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier 
of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; 
that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. And if a man also strive 
for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. The husbandman that 
laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. Consider what I say; and the Lord give 
thee understanding in all things. Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David 
was raised from the dead according to my gospel: Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil 
doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. Therefore I endure all 
things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ 
Jesus with eternal Glory ..., 
</p><p><i class="note">Alleluia, in Tone IV:</i> The righteous man shall flourish like a palm-tree; like a 
cedar in Lebanon shall he be multiplied.

God shall they blossom forth. 
<h3>THE HOLY GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. JOHN (15:17- 16:2)</h3><p>The Lord said unto His disciples: These things I command you, that ye love one 
another. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye 
were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, 
but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember 
the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have 
persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will 
keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, 
because they know not him that sent me. If I had not come and spoken unto them, 
they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin. He that hateth me 
hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them the works which none other 
man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and 
my Father. But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in 
their law, They hated me without a cause. But when the Comforter is come, whom I 
will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from 
the Father, he shall testify of me: 27 And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have 
been with me from the beginning. These things have I spoken unto you, that ye 
should not be offended. They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time 
cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.

<h3>Psalm 64</h3>
For the end. A psalm and song of David
THOU, O God, art praised in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed in
Jerusalem.
Thou that hearest the prayer: unto thee shall all flesh come.
My misdeeds prevail against me: O be thou merciful unto our sins.
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: he shall dwell
in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house, even of
thy holy temple.
Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation: thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that remain in the broad sea.
Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains: and is girded about with power.
Who stilleth the raging of the sea: and the noise of his waves, and the madness of
the people.
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afraid at thy
tokens: thou that makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
praise thee.
Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very plenteous.
The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest
for the earth.
Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof: thou
makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop fatness.
They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and the little hills shall
rejoice on every side.
The folds shall be full of sheep: the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn,
that they shall laugh and sing.
<h3>Psalm 65</h3>
For the end. A song of a plasm of resurrection
O BE joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of his Name, make
his praise to be glorious.
Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the greatness of
thy power shall thine enemies be found liars unto thee.
For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy Name.
O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is in his doing
toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the water on foot;
there did we rejoice thereof.
He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people: and such as will
not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.
O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to slip.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our loins.
Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water, and
thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay thee my vows, which I
promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of rams: I will offer
bullocks and goats.
O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what he hath
done for my soul.
I called unto him with my mouth: and gave him praises with my tongue.
If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart: the Lord will not hear me.
But God hath heard me: and considered the voice of my prayer.
Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned his mercy from me.
<h3>Psalm 66</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns
GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his countenance,
and be merciful unto us:
That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the folk righteously,
and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God, shall
give us his blessing.
God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

<h3>Psalm 67</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song of David
LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee
before him.
Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away: and like as wax
melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the presence of God.
But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them also be merry and
joyful .
O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name: magnify him that rideth upon
the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise him in his Name JAH, and
rejoice before him.
He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows: even God
in his holy habitation.
He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the
prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates continue in scarceness.
O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through
the wilderness;
The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God: even as Sinai
also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.
Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreshedst it
when it was weary.
Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness
prepared for the poor.
The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers.
Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited: and they of the household
divided the spoil.
Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove: that
is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.
When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake: then were they as white as
snow in Salmon.
As the hill of Basan, so is God's hill: even an high hill, as the hill of Basan.
Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which it pleaseth him to
dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: and the Lord
is among them, as in the holy place of Sinai.
Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for
men: yea, even for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among
them.
Praised be the Lord daily: even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his benefits
upon us.
He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is the Lord, by
whom we escape death.
God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalp of such a one as
goeth on still in his wickedness.
The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan: mine own
will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the tongue of
thy dogs may be red through the same.
It is well seen, O God, how thou goest: how thou, my God and King, goest in the
sanctuary.
The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the damsels
playing with the timbrels.
Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations: from the ground
of the heart.
There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their counsel: the
princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.
Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing, O God, that thou
hast wrought in us,
For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem: so shall kings bring presents unto thee.
When the company of the spear-men, and multitude of the mighty are scattered
abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they humbly bring pieces of
silver: and when he hath scattered the people that delight in war;
Then shall the princes come out of Eqypt: the Morians' land shall soon stretch
our her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord;
Who sitteth in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he doth send out his
voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.
Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel: his worship and strength is in the
clouds.
O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: even the God of Israel, he will give
strength and power unto his people; blessed be God.

<h3>Psalm 68</h3>
For the end. A Psalm of David for alternate verses
SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.
I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is: I am come into deep waters, so
that the floods run over me.
I am weary of crying; my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for waiting so long
upon my God.
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that
are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.
I paid them the things that I never took: God, thou knowest my simpleness, and
my faults are not hid from thee.
Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my cause:
let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of
Israel.
And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof: shame hath covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an alien unto my mother's
children.
For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me: and the rebukes of them that
rebuked thee are fallen upon me.
I wept, and chastened myself with fasting: and that was turned to my reproof.
I put on sackcloth also: and they jested upon me.
They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs upon
me.
But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.
Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the truth of thy salvation.
Take me out of the mire, that I sink not: O let me be delivered from them that
hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up: and let
not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable: turn thee unto me
according to the multitude of thy mercies.
And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: O haste thee, and
hear me.
Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: O deliver me, because of mine enemies.
Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are
all in thy sight.
Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to
have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.
They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and let the things that
should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.
Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not: and ever bow thou down their backs.
Pour out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold
of them.
Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they talk how they may vex
them whom thou hast wounded.
Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and not come into thy
righteousness.
Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be written among the
righteous.
As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God, shall lift me up.
I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with thanksgiving.
This also shall please the Lord: better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God, and your soul
shall live.
For the Lord heareth the poor: and despiseth not his prisoners.
Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea, and all that moveth therein.
For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah: that men may dwell there,
and have it in possession.
The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his Name
shall dwell therein.
<h3>Psalm 69</h3>
For the end. By David for a remembrance; that the Lord may save me
HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned
backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.
Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame: that cry over me, There,
there.
But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let all such as
delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and in misery: haste thee unto me, O God.
Thou art my helper and my redeemer: O Lord, make no long tarrying.

        <h3>The Reading from the Book of Exodus (20:12-18).</h3><p>The Lord said unto Moses: Come up to Me into the mount and be there; and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written that thou mayest teach them. And Moses and his minister Joshua rose up and went up into the mount of God, and Moses said unto the elders: Tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you; and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. And the glory of the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And the seventh day the Lord called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. And Moses went into the midst of the cloud and gat him up into the mount; and was in the mount forty days and forty nights.</p><h3>The Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy. (4:1,6-15).</h3><p> Moses said unto the people: Now hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them, that ye may live. Keep therefore and do them;3 for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of thenations, which shall hear all these statutes and say: surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon Him for. And now take heed to yourselves, all ye the house of Israel, and keep your souls diligently, lest ye forget the things which your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your hearts all the days of your life. But teach them your sons and your sons' sons, specially the day that ye stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me: Gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children. .And ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds and thick darkness. And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude, only ye heard a voice. And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform. Aid the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that ye might do them in the land. The Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.</p><h3>The Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy (5:1-7,9,10,23-26,28; 6:1,2,4,5,13,18).</h3><p>Moses called all Israel, and said unto them: Hear, O Israel the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them and keep and do them: The Lord God made a covenant with you in Horeb, not with your fathers alone did the Lord make His covenant, but with you also. The Lord talked face to face in Horeb out of the midst of the fire, and I stood between the Lord and you at that time to declare unto you the words of the Lord saying: I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; there are no others gods beside Me, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments. And it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of fire, and the mountain did burn with fire, that ye all came near unto me,and ye said: Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed us His glory, and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God doth talk with man and he liveth. Now, why should we die? for this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die. For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the Lord speaking out of the midst of the fire, and liveth? And the Lord heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke unto me, and I said unto you all the commandments, the statutes and the judgments which the Lord commanded you that ye might fear all His statutes, that He may be merciful unto you and that ye may increase in the land. Hear, Israel, the Lord your God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy thought, with all thy heart, with all thy soul and with all thy might; thou shalt fear Him and serve Him alone, cleave unto Him, thou shalt swear by His name and shalt do that which is good in His sight, that it may be well with thee.

<h3>Psalm 70</h3>
By David. A psalm sung by the sons of Jonadab and the first that were taken captive
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: but rid
me and deliver me in thy righteousness, incline thine ear unto me, and save
me.
Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may alway resort: thou hast promised to
help me, for thou art my house of defence and my castle.
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the hand of the
unrighteous and cruel man.
For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope, even from
my youth.
Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: thou art he that took
me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall be always of thee.
I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is in thee.
O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy glory and honour
all the day long.
Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength faileth
me.
For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul take their
counsel together, saying: God hath forsaken him; persecute him, and take
him, for there is none to deliver him.
Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me.
Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul: let them be covered
with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.
As for me, I will patiently abide alway: and will praise thee more and more.
My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation: for I know no end
thereof.
I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy
righteousness only.
Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I tell of
thy wondrous works.
Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed: until I have
shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that
are yet for to come.
Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are they that thou hast
done; O God, who is like unto thee?
O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me, and yet didst thou
turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth
again.
Thou hast brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every side.
Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an
instrument of musick: unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Holy One
of Israel.
My lips will be fain when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul whom thou hast
delivered.
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are
confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.
<h3>Psalm 71</h3>
For Solomon
GIVE the King thy judgements, O God: and thy righteousness unto the King's
son.
Then shall he judge thy people according unto right: and defend the poor.
The mountains also shall bring peace: and the little hills righteousness unto the
people.
He shall keep the simple folk by their right: defend the children of the poor, and
punish the wrong-doer.
They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth: from one generation
to another.
He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool: even as the drops that
water the earth.
In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea, and abundance of peace, so long as
the moon endureth.
His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other: and from the flood unto
the world's end.
They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him: his enemies shall lick
the dust.
The kings of Tharsis and of the isles shall give presents: the kings of Arabia and
Saba shall bring gifts.
All kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do him service.
For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth: the needy also, and him that hath
no helper.
He shall be favourable to the simple and needy: and shall preserve the souls of
the poor.
He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong: and dear shall their blood
be in his sight.
He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia: prayer shall be
made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.
There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills: his fruit shall
shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city like grass upon the earth.
His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the
posterities: which shall be blessed through him; and all the heathen shall
praise him.
Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel: which only doeth wondrous
things;
And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: and all the earth shall be filled
with his majesty. Amen, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 72</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
TRULY God is loving unto Israel: even unto such as are of a clean heart.
Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone: my treadings had well-nigh slipt.
And why? I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such
prosperity.
For they are in no peril of death: but are lusty and strong.
They come in no misfortune like other folk: neither are they plagued like other
men.
And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride: and overwhelmed with
cruelty.
Their eyes swell with fatness: and they do even what they lust.
They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy: their talking is against the
most High.
For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their tongue goeth
through the world.
Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no small advantage.
Tush, say they, how should God perceive it: is there knowledge in the most High?
Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in
possession: and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed
mine hands in innocency.
All the day long have I been punished: and chastened every morning.
Yea, and I had almost said even as they: but lo, then I should have condemned
the generation of thy children.
Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me,
Until I went into the sanctuary of God: then understood I the end of these men;
Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places: and castest them down, and
destroyest them.
O how suddenly do they consume: perish, and come to a fearful end!
Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh: so shalt thou make their image to
vanish out of the city.
Thus my heart was grieved: and it went even through my reins.
So foolish was I, and ignorant: even as it were a beast before thee.
Nevertheless, I am alway by thee: for thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel: and after that receive me with glory.
Whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth that I desire in
comparison of thee.
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my
portion for ever.
For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that
commit fornication against thee.
But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord God: and
to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
<h3>Psalm 73</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot
against the sheep of thy pasture?
O think upon thy congregation: whom thou hast purchased and redeemed of old.
Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance: and mount Sion, wherein thou hast
dwelt.
Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy: which hath done
evil in thy sanctuary.
Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations: and set up their
banners for tokens.
He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees: was known to bring it to an
excellent work.
But now they break down all the carved work thereof: with axes and hammers.
They have set fire upon thy holy places: and have defiled the dwelling-place of
thy Name, even unto the ground.
Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether: thus have
they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.
We see not our tokens, there is not one prophet more: no, not one is there among
us, that understandeth any more.
O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour: how long shall the enemy
blaspheme thy Name, for ever?
Why withdrawest thou thy hand: why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy
bosom to consume the enemy?
For God is my King of old: the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself.
Thou didst divide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the
dragons in the waters.
Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces: and gavest him to be meat for the
people in the wilderness.
Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks: thou driedst up
mighty waters.
The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked: and how the foolish
people hath blasphemed thy Name.
O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the enemies: and
forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.
Look upon the covenant: for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel
habitations.
O let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the poor and needy give praise
unto thy Name.
Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
blasphemeth thee daily.
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the presumption of them that hate thee
increaseth ever more and more.

<h3>Psalm 74</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: A psalm of a song for Asaph
UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks: yea, unto thee do we give thanks.
Thy Name also is so nigh: and that do thy wondrous works declare.
When I receive the congregation: I shall judge according unto right.
The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the pillars of it.
I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly: and to the ungodly, Set not up your horn.
Set not up your horn on high: and speak not with a stiff neck.
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west: nor yet from the
south.
And why? God is the Judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixed,
and he poureth out of the same.
As for the dregs thereof: all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and suck
them out.
But I will talk of the God of Jacob: and praise him for ever.
All the horns of the ungodly also will I break: and the horns of the righteous shall
be exalted.
<h3>Psalm 75</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns, a psalm for Asaph: A song for the Assyrian
IN JEWRY is God known: his Name is great in Israel.
At Salem is his tabernacle: and his dwelling in Sion.
There brake he the arrows of the bow: the shield, the sword, and the battle.
Thou art of more honour and might: than the hills of the robbers.
The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep: and all the men whose hands
were mighty have found nothing.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob: both the chariot and horse are fallen.
Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when thou art
angry?
Thou didst cause thy judgement to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled,
and was still;
When God arose to judgement: and to help all the meek upon earth.
The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise: and the fierceness of them shalt
thou refrain.
Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that are round about him:
bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
He shall refrain the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among the kings of the
earth.
<h3>Psalm 76</h3>
For the end. For Idithun, a psalm of Asaph
I WILL cry unto God with my voice: even unto God will I cry with my voice, and
he shall hearken unto me.
In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran and ceased not in the
night-season ; my soul refused comfort.
When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God: when my heart is vexed, I will
complain.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble, that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old: and the years that are past.
I call to remembrance my song: and in the night I commune with mine own
heart, and search out my spirits.
Will the Lord absent himself for ever: and will he be no more intreated?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly to an end for
evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his loving-kindness in
displeasure?
And I said, It is mine own infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right
hand of the most Highest.
I will remember the works of the Lord: and call to mind thy wonders of old time.
I will think also of all thy works: and my talking shall be of thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is holy: who is so great a God as our God?
Thou art the God that doeth wonders: and hast declared thy power among the
people.
Thou hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid: the depths
also were troubled.
The clouds poured out water, the air thundered: and thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: the lightnings shone upon the
ground: the earth was moved, and shook withal.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and thy footsteps are
not known.
Thou leddest thy people like sheep: by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<h3>Psalm 77</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
HEAR my law, O my people: incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hard sentences of old;
Which we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told us;
That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to come: but
to shew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he
hath done.
He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law: which he commanded our
forefathers to teach their children;
That their posterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn;
To the intent that when they came up: they might shew their children the same;
That they might put their trust in God: and not to forget the works of God, but to
keep his commandments;
And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation: a
generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not
stedfastly unto God;
Like as the children of Ephraim: who being harnessed, and carrying bows,
turned themselves back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his law;
But forgat what he had done: and the wonderful works that he had shewed for
them.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt:
even in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea, and let them go through: he made the waters to stand on an
heap.
In the day-time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night through with a
light of fire.
He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness: and gave them drink thereof, as it had
been out of the great depth.
He brought waters out of the stony rock: so that it gushed out like the rivers.
Yet for all this they sinned more against him: and provoked the most Highest in
the wilderness.
They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their lust.
They spake against God also, saying: Shall God prepare a table in the
wilderness?
He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
flowed withal: but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?
When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and
there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;
Because they believed not in God: and put not their trust in his help.
So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.
He rained down manna also upon them for to eat: and gave them food from
heaven.
So man did eat angels' food: for he sent them meat enough.
He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven: and through his power he
brought in the south-west-wind.
He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand
of the sea.
He let it fall among their tents: even round about their habitation.
So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire: they were
not disappointed of their lust.
But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon
them, and slew the wealthiest of them: yea, and smote down the chosen
men that were in Israel.
But for all this they sinned yet more: and believed not his wondrous works.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years in trouble.
When he slew them, they sought him: and turned them early, and inquired after
God.
And they remembered that God was their strength: and that the high God was
their redeemer.
Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and dissembled with him
in their tongue.
For their heart was not whole with him: neither continued they stedfast in his
covenant.
But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds: and destroyed them not.
Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not suffer his whole
displeasure to arise.
For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were even a wind that
passeth away, and cometh not again.
Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness: and grieved him in the
desert.
They turned back, and tempted God: and moved the Holy One in Israel.
They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered them from the
hand of the enemy;
How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
He turned their waters into blood: so that they might not drink of the rivers.
He sent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to destroy them.
He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar: and their labour unto the grasshopper.
He destroyed their vines with hail-stones: and their mulberry-trees with the frost.
He smote their cattle also with hail-stones: and their flocks with hot
thunderbolts.
He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure and trouble:
and sent evil angels among them.
He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death: but gave
their life over to the pestilence;
And smote all the first-born in Egypt: the most principal and mightiest in the
dwellings of Ham.
But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep: and carried them in the
wilderness like a flock.
He brought them out safely, that they should not fear: and overwhelmed their
enemies with the sea.
And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary: even to his mountain
which he purchased with his right hand.
He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land to be divided among
them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not his testimonies;
But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers: starting aside like a
broken bow.
For they grieved him with their hill-altars: and provoked him to displeasure with
their images.
When God heard this, he was wroth: and took sore displeasure at Israel.
So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that he had pitched
among men.
He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with his inheritance.
The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not given to
marriage.
Their priests were slain with the sword: and there were no widows to make
lamentation.
So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep: and like a giant refreshed with wine.
He smote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a perpetual shame.
He refused the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
But chose the tribe of Judah: even the hill of Sion which he loved.
And there he built his temple on high: and laid the foundation of it like the
ground which he hath made continually.
He chose David also his servant: and took him away from the sheep-folds.
As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him: that he might
feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
So he fed them with a faithful and true heart: and ruled them prudently with all
his power.

<h3>Psalm 78</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they
defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the
air: and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.
Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem: and there was
no man to bury them.
We are become an open shame to our enemies: a very scorn and derision unto
them that are round about us.
Lord, how long wilt thou be angry: shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?
Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee: and upon
the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.
For they have devoured Jacob: and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon: for we are
come to great misery.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: O deliver us, and be
merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake.
Wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?
O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed: be openly shewed upon
the heathen in our sight.
O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to the
greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die.
And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee: reward
thou them , O Lord, seven-fold into their bosom.
So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for
ever: and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to
generation.
<h3>Psalm 79</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses. A testimony for Asaph: a Psalm concerning the Assyrian
HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep: shew
thyself also, thou that sittest upon the cherubims.
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses: stir up thy strength, and come, and
help us.
Turn us again, O God: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
O Lord God of hosts: how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears: and givest them plenteousness of
tears to drink.
Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh us
to scorn.
Turn us again, thou God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall
be whole.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and
planted it.
Thou madest room for it: and when it had taken root it filled the land.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it: and the boughs thereof were like
the goodly cedar-trees.
She stretched out her branches unto the sea: and her boughs unto the river.
Why hast thou then broken down her hedge: that all they that go by pluck off her
grapes?
The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up: and the wild beasts of the field
devour it.
Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven: behold, and visit this
vine;
And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted: and the branch
that thou madest so strong for thyself.
It is burnt with fire, and cut down: and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy
countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man, whom
thou madest so strong for thine own self.
And so will not we go back from thee: O let us live, and we shall call upon thy
Name.
Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.
<h3>Psalm 80</h3>

SING we merrily unto God our strength: make a cheerful noise unto the God of
Jacob.
Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret: the merry harp with the lute.
Blow up the trumpet in the new-moon: even in the time appointed, and upon our
solemn feast-day.
For this was made a statute for Israel: and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony: when he came out of the land of
Egypt, and had heard a strange language.
I eased his shoulder from the burden: and his hands were delivered from making
the pots.
Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee: and heard thee what
time as the storm fell upon thee.
I proved thee also: at the waters of strife.
Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel: if thou wilt hearken unto me,
There shall no strange god be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any other god.
I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy
mouth wide, and I shall fill it.
But my people would not hear my voice: and Israel would not obey me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts: and let them follow their own
imaginations.
O that my people would have hearkened unto me: for if Israel had walked in my
ways,
I should soon have put down their enemies: and turned my hand against their
adversaries.
The haters of the Lord should have been found liars: but their time should have
endured for ever.
He should have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour: and with honey out of
the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

But ye shall die like men: and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth: for thou shalt take all heathen to thine
inheritance.
<h3>Psalm 82</h3>
A song of a psalm for Asaph
HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: refrain not thyself, O God.
For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring: and they that hate thee have lift up
their head.
They have imagined craftily against thy people: and taken counsel against thy
secret ones.
They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people:
and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
For they have cast their heads together with one consent: and are confederate
against thee;
The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismaelites: the Moabites and
Hagarenes;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek: the Philistines, with them that dwell at Tyre.
Assur also is joined with them: and have holpen the children of Lot.
But do thou to them as unto the Madianites: unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the
brook of Kison;
Who perished at Endor: and became as the dung of the earth.
Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeb: yea, make all their princes like
as Zeba and Salmana;
Who say, Let us take to ourselves: the houses of God in possession.
O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and as the stubble before the wind;
Like as the fire that burneth up the wood: and as the flame that consumeth the
mountains.
Persecute them even so with thy tempest: and make them afraid with thy storm.
Make their faces ashamed, O Lord: that they may seek thy Name.
Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more: let them be put to
shame, and perish.
And they shall know that thou, whose Name is Jehovah: art only the most Highest
over all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 83</h3>
For the end. A song for the sons of Core, concerning the winepresses
O HOW amiable are thy dwellings: thou Lord of hosts!
My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the Lord: my heart
and my flesh rejoice in the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest where she may
lay her young: even thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be alway praising thee.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are thy ways.
Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well: and the pools are filled
with water.
They will go from strength to strength: and unto the God of gods appeareth every
one of them in Sion.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer :hearken, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our defender: and look upon the face of thine Anointed.
For one day in thy courts: is better than a thousand.
I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God: than to dwell in the tents
of ungodliness.
For the Lord God is a light and defence: the Lord will give grace and worship,
and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a godly life.
O Lord God of hosts: blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 84</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou hast turned away the
captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people: and covered all their sins.
Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure: and turned thyself from thy wrathful
indignation.
Turn us then, O God our Saviour: and let thine anger cease from us.
Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever: and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from
one generation to another?
Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Shew us thy mercy, O Lord: and grant us thy salvation.
I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak
peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again.
For his salvation is nigh them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each
other.
Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness hath looked down from
heaven.
Yea, the Lord shall shew loving-kindness: and our land shall give her increase.
Righteousness shall go before him: and he shall direct his going in the way.

        </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the precious & life-creating Cross, the acrostic whereof is, “Grace be to God, Who was nailed to the Tree”, the composition of Joseph, in Tone VII: </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The wonderworking staff of Moses, * striking and dividing the sea in the figure of a cross, * once drowned Pharaoh the pursuing charioteer, * while it saved the fleeing people of Israel * as they fled on foot, * chanting a hymn unto God. O Word, having died on the Cross, Thou hast given life to me who was slain by the tree through pleasing food, and thereby adorned me with glory. I worship Thy dominion, glorifying Thy sufferings and infinite tender compassion. When the uncultivated Grape hung upon the Tree, He exuded for us the wine of divine grace which gladdeneth our hearts, wholly doing away with the drunkenness of error, and washing away sins. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Arrayed in wounds and adorned with the pangs of your sufferings, O great martyrs, ye stood with glory before the beneficent Master, rejoicing most gloriously, recognized as godlike. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Manifestly strengthened by divine power, ye manfully cast down all the pernicious power of the mighty one; and beautifully invested with crowns of victory, ye stand before God, rejoicing. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Standing before Thy Cross, O Lord, she who knew not wedlock, beholding Thy wounds, O Master, was wounded, and said: “Woe is me, O my Child! I escaped pain at Thy birth but am now rent apart by pain!” </p><p><i class="note">Another canon, of the most holy Theotokos, in Tone VII: </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i></i> Same as the foregoing. In thee, O Virgin, I have placed my hope of salvation. Wash me clean of all the filth of sin and make me pure, that I may act and be well-pleasing to thy Son and God and His all-holy name. O portal of the Light, enlighten mine eyes which the gloomy serpent hath enshrouded with the darkness of transgressions. Open unto me the doors of repentance, O Virgin; guide me to life, and rescue me from the flame and darkness. As thou hast boldness before Him Who was born from thee: the only-begotten Word Who with the Father is without beginning: pray thou, O all-immaculate one, that He deliver my soul from the oppression of the demons, from fire and every torment. O blessed and most pure Bride of God, blessed is the Fruit of thy womb whereby all of us mortals have been delivered from the curse: an ineffable wonder, incomprehensible knowledge, the salvation of all the faithful! </p><h3>Ode III</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Christ fortify me on the rock of Thy commandments, * Thou Who in the beginning didst establish the heavens with understanding * and didst establish the earth upon the waters, * for there is none holy save Thee, O only Lover of mankind. O Thou Who established the heavens, Who set the foundations of the earth and set the boundaries of the sea by Thy word, Thou wast bound for my sake and nailed to the Cross, that Thou mightest release me from the bonds of sin, O Lover of mankind. Hurling himself against the tree of the Cross, the enemy and his pernicious demons were slain; he who was condemned for wickedly eating hath found mercy; and creation hath been made steadfast by the confirmation of piety. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The godly and valiant spiritual athletes had their naked bodies subjected to all manner of wounds, sharp blades, and wild beasts by the wicked persecutors; but, protected by God’s hand, they remained undaunted. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Looking in thought with watchful mind toward things to come, the glorious martyrs of Christ utterly spurned transitory things; wherefore, rejoicing, they endured unbearable wounds. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The greatly hymned Ewe-lamb, beholding the Lamb unjustly lifted up upon the Tree, cried out, weeping and shedding maternal tears. And she hymned and glorified His long-suffering. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Lord, thou art the confirmation of those who flee to Thee, * Thou art the Light of those in darkness, * and my spirit doth hymn Thee. All my desire is directed toward thee, O pure Lady: quickly free me of carnal desires. O Lady, portal of the Light, shine upon me the pure rays of repentance, and dispel the gloom of my sins. O only all-immaculate one, deliver us from every lust, from the temptations which assail us, and everlasting fire. Haste thou, O most pure one, to visit me who am sick, and deliver me from grievous wounds and every affliction. </p><h3>Ode IV</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Thou, O Lord, art my strength and Thou art my power, * Thou art my God and Thou art my joy, * Thou Who, while never leaving the bosom of Thy Father, * hast visited our poverty. * Therefore with the Prophet Habbakuk I cry unto Thee, * ‘Glory to Thy power, O Lover of mankind!’ The race of mankind hath been recalled from the fall which the first-formed man suffered of old; for the Creator of all was lifted up upon the Tree, His fingers bloody, His hands run through with nails of His own will, His side pierced by a spear. When the Cross was set up, all deceit was felled; when Thy garments, O Savior, were removed, the alien one was stripped naked, and Adam was arrayed in a robe of divine incorruption. Creation was enlightened when Thou wast crucified on the Tree, O Christ, and the sun dimmed its rays. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Like sheep, O martyrs, ye offered yourselves to the slaughtered Word as a new sacrifice; and drying up the sea of falsehood with streams of blood and divine grace, ever halting the outflow of the passions with the rain of miracles, O glorious ones. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye endured the mutilation of all your members, O martyrs: the uprooting of your teeth and nails, the pitiless amputation of your hands, tongues, feet and bodily extremities: wherefore, ye have been deemed worthy of the greatest glory, and stand before the God of all. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Seeing her Bullock lifted up upon the Tree, the unblemished heifer cried out, exclaiming: “O my Child, how hath the assembly of the iniquitous failed to have pity on Thee Who had pity on them, but instead by a deceitful plot they unjustly willed to murder Thee?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Lord, I have heard the mystery of Thy dispensation; * I have considered Thy works, * and I have glorified Thy Divinity. With light illumine my soul, which hath been darkened by transgressions, O Ever-virgin, for thou hast given birth to the Sun of righteousness. Rescue me from temptations and the soul-destroying tempest of life, O Bride of God, and free me from everlasting fire. O sacred vessel of virginity, habitation of Him Who by nature is uncontainable: Enlighten my soul, which hath been darkened by many passions. O all-holy Bride of God, Sovereign Lady of the world: Save me, delivering me from misfortunes and dispelling the tumult of the passions. </p><h3>Ode V</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Light never-waning, * why hast Thou turned Thy face from me * and why hath the alien darkness surrounded me, * wretched though I be? * But do Thou guide my steps I implore Thee * and turn me back towards the light of Thy commandments. That Thou mightest deliver me from the beguiling taste (of the fruit), Thou didst deign to taste gall, O Long-suffering One; and that Thou mightest strip me of the mortality of the passions, O Jesus, Thou didst will to be nailed, naked, to the Tree. I hymn Thy loving-kindness! Making new my soul, which had been corrupted by the passions, O Word, Thou didst commit Thy soul to the Father, whilst hanging on the Tree. Perceiving this, the inanimate earth could not bear it, but quaked in fear, hymning Thee. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Arrayed in divine sufferings, having followed in the steps of Him Who by His sufferings hath granted dispassion unto all: the only-begotten Word of the beginningless Father: ye were adorned, O martyrs; wherefore, ye are glorified with Him. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having rejected things below, ye inherited invisible things, making your abode in the divine habitations of heaven, immaterially deified by divine communion, O invincible martyrs of the Savior. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “A strange sight do I see,” the all-hymned one cried; “How hast Thou, at the sight of Whom the whole earth doth quake, fallen asleep lifted up upon the Tree, desiring to wake those asleep from all ages? I bow down before Thy long-suffering, O my Son!” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Rising early we cry to Thee, O Lord; * save us, for Thou art our God, * and we know none other besides Thee. We hymn thee, O all-hymned and most immaculate Virgin, who contained the Word of God in thy womb. As thou hast the power to spare and to cure, deliver me from the unquenchable fire and the worm, O Mother of God. Thou art the bulwark and might of the faithful, O all-holy one, from temptations saving those who hymn thee. Heal thou mine ailing soul, O most pure Lady who hast given birth to the Salvation of all Who taketh away our infirmities. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The abyss of my sins and the storm of my transgressions * disquieten me and thrust me down * into the depths of despondency; * but do Thou stretch forth Thy mighty arm, * unto me as Thou didst to Peter, * and save me, O my Guide.  All the hosts of heaven sang and were amazed, seeing Thee hanging upon the Cross, O Word, for by Thy wounds Thou didst heal wounded Adam, and the curse hath been annulled Mankind was released from unbreakable bonds when Thou wast bound in the flesh, O Word; and the tyrant is bound like a bird, reviled by all the faithful. Glory to Thy tender compassion, O Christ! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye were shown to be like burning coals consuming all the tinder of ungodliness with grace, O godly passion-bearers, for seared on burning coals of fire, ye received divine coolness. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> As sheep of the true Shepherd, ye remained unharmed even in the midst of wild wolves, O passion-bearers; and having finished your race well, O divine ones, ye now dwell in the fold of heaven. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “I gave birth to Thee, the Lord of my life, Who art comely in beauty more than the sons of men,” the Virgin cried out; “How dost Thou now die crucified, bereft of beauty, O my Son Who by Thy hand didst make all beautiful?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Cleanse me, O Savior, * for many are mine iniquities; * lead me up from the abyss of evils I pray Thee, * for unto Thee have I cried, * and Thou hast hearkened unto me, * O God of my salvation.  O Mary, pure and most honorable habitation of the Creator of all, grant me tears to purify my soul, and rescue me from the judgment and torment to come. O Theotokos, thou gate of God, reveal to my lowly soul the divine entry, that entering therein with confession, I may receive remission of mine evil deeds. My mind is tempest-tossed in the deep of sins amid the waves of despair. Have pity, O Lady, extend thy hand to me, and save me, O thou who hast given birth to the Savior. Amid the depths of evils, ever beset by turmoil and tribulations, all of us, the faithful, have thee as an intercessor and support, O Theotokos, thou only refuge of the faithful. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Once in Babylon the fire stood in awe * of God's condescension; * for which sake the youths in the furnace, * dancing with joyous steps as in a meadow, chanted: * O God of our fathers, Blessed art Thou!  The hands wherewith Thou didst work wonders were wounded, O Christ; and Thou didst endure wounds, healing all my wounds. O only Long-suffering One, I hymn Thee, crying out: Blessed is the God of our fathers! Crucified, Thy hands and feet were run through with nails, and Thy side, pierced, poured forth drops of remission upon all who unceasingly chant and say: Blessed is the God of our fathers! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Let us form a choir, hymning the martyrs of God, who are numbered with the angelic choirs, enlighten those on earth, who ever chant: Blessed is the God of our fathers! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Sanctified, ye have come to dwell amid the splendors of the saints, O divine martyrs, sending down upon all who praise you, sanctification and deliverance; wherefore they sing unto Christ: Blessed is the God of our fathers! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “O never-setting Sun, how hast Thou set, crucified on the Tree?”, the Virgin cried out to Thee, O Word; “The sun, seeing this, hath halted in its circuit, unable to shine when Thou art suffering, O Master. I hymn Thine innocence, O my Son!” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The Hebrew children in the furnace * boldly trampled upon the flames, * changing the fire into dew, they cried aloud: * 'Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, throughout the ages'.  I beseech thee, O most pure Virgin: Slay the sin which liveth in me, grant that I may receive life, and deliver me from the lot of those who are tormented in the life to come. Divers passions disquiet me, O pure one who hast given birth to the Source of dispassion. By thy prayers O Theotokos, deliver me from their oppression and from everlasting fire. I sin of mine own free will, and, enslaved to unseemly habits, I flee now to thy customary mercy. Save me who am despairing, O all-holy Theotokos. Quench thou the flame of my passions, and still the tempest of my heart, O pure Mother of God; and deliver me from the tyranny of the demons and from everlasting fire, O most pure one. </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> In his wrath the Chaldean Tyrant made the furnace blaze, * with heat fanned sevenfold for the servants of God; * but when he perceived that they had been saved by a greater power * he cried aloud to the Creator and Redeemer; * ‘ye children bless, ye priests praise, * ye people, supremely exalt Him throughout all ages’. Thou didst spring forth, incarnate, from the root of Jesse, and, wearing the crown of thorns, uprooted the burgeoning thorns of Adam’s crime. Nailed to the Tree, Thou hast healed the curse which sprang forth from a tree, and saving those who chant: Hymn O ye priests! Supremely exalt Him O ye people, throughout all ages! That Thou mightest make man god, Thou didst become man, O Lover of mankind; and affixed to the Cross, Thou wast pierced in the side and given vinegar and gall to drink. But saved by Thy sufferings, O Word, we cry out in thanksgiving: O ye priests! Supremely exalt Him O ye people, throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Bound, and slaughtered like lambs, mercilessly roasted in the fire, cast to the wild beasts, your heads cut off, ye rejoiced with indescribable joy, O martyrs, crying out: Ye children, bless; ye priests, hymn; ye people, exalt Christ supremely forever! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O crowned martyrs, companions of the angels, who trampled the incorporeal foe underfoot: make entreaty for us to the Lord, that we may live in love and great oneness of mind, crying out with unwavering heart: Ye children bless; ye priests hymn; ye people, supremely exalt Christ throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Groaning with pain, thou didst cry out maternally; and unable to bear the turmoil in thy womb, thou didst look upon Him Who was born from thy womb hanging upon the Cross, and didst cry out: “What is this sight, O my Child? How is it that Thou sufferest, Who art by nature dispassionate, desiring in every way to free the race of mankind from the passions?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The King of heaven, * Who is glorified by the hosts of angels, * let us praise and supremely exalt throughout all ages. O Virgin Birthgiver of God, ease thou the burden of my sins and transgressions, that I may magnify thee. O pure one, who hast given birth to God the Judge, by thine appeasing supplications show Him to be merciful unto me, that He may deliver me, from everlasting fire. My many transgressions have increased, O Theotokos. Grant me now a helping hand, and deliver me, the useless one, from the ever-burning flame. O most pure one, I pray thee: Enlighten the eyes of my heart, which have been blinded by the blackness of sin; and show them to be receptive to divine radiance, that for thy sake I may be shown to be pure for thy Son. We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the </p><p><i class="note">refrain:</i> “More honorable than the cherubim ...”<i class="note"> Prostrations.</i> </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Heaven was stricken with awe, * and the ends of the earth were filled with amazement, * for God hath appeared in the flesh, * and thy womb was rendered more spacious than the heavens. * Wherefore, the ranks of men and of angels * magnify thee as the Theotokos.  With Thy wounded and blood-stained hands Thou didst heal my wounds, O Master and Lord, in that Thou art good; and Thou didst show me how to walk the paths of salvation, Thy feet affixed to the Cross - those feet at the sight of which, our first parents of old they hid themselves when they beheld Thee walking in paradise. When Thou wast set upright on the Cross, the first-formed man, who had suffered a great fall, was set aright, all the might of the enemy fell, and the whole earth was sanctified by the blood and water which flowed from Thy side. Wherefore, we magnify Thee unceasingly, O most Compassionate One. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Bound, O holy martyrs, ye loosed the bonds of the evil one, and with the bonds which ye patiently endured ye bound him and set him under your feet, full of shame, and by divine grace made him a mockery for those who saw him. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> By the deposition of the sacred relics of the martyrs the earth hath been sanctified; for having acquired them as a divine wellspring, they pour forth all manner of healings, unceasingly healing the passions of soul and body, and with divine grace annulling the bane of the demons. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Having escaped maternal pangs when I gave birth to Thee, O Long-suffering One, I now suffer pangs in my womb, and my soul is filled with pain, as Thou now willingly partakest of suffering, and dost accept pain!”, cried the most pure one, whom we magnify as is meet. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Every ear is awestruck at hearing of God's ineffable condescension, * for the Most High voluntarily descended and assumed flesh, * becoming man in the Virgin's womb; * wherefore we the faithful magnify the most pure Theotokos. Take pity on my wretched soul, O most pure one, mortify my destructive passions, and dispel the perplexity which torments me; and grant me holy and ever-vivifying streams of tears, whereby I may be delivered from the grievous condemnation which awaits me. O pure Virgin Bride of God, thou art a bulwark for Christians and a safe refuge for the world, wherein we are saved; for God, having become incarnate from thee, hath given thee to all as a saving protection. Wherefore, save me who am unworthy, O pure one. “O my Son, beginningless Word of the Father, Who art co-enthroned with the Holy Spirit, how is it that Thou hast stretched out Thy most precious feet upon the Cross? What is this great abasement, O Supremely good One?”, the all-immaculate one cried out, standing before Thee as Thou wast crucified. O thou who hast given birth to the Sweetness of all, letting drops of divine sweetness fall, sweeten my soul, which hath been made bitter by the venom of the serpent, O sure intercessor of the faithful, ever estranging me to bitter sin by thy mediation.

<h3>Psalm 85</h3>
A prayer of David
BOW down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor, and in misery.
Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: my God, save thy servant that putteth his
trust in thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I will call daily upon thee.
Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, art good and gracious: and of great mercy unto all them that call
upon thee.
Give ear, Lord, unto my prayer: and ponder the voice of my humble desires.
In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou hearest me.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord: there is not one that can do
as thou doest.
All nations whom thou hadst made shall come and worship thee, O Lord: and
shall glorify thy Name.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in thy truth: O knit my heart unto
thee, that I may fear thy Name.
I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and will praise thy Name for
evermore.
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the
nethermost hell.
O God, the proud are risen against me: and the congregations of naughty men
have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.
But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, plenteous
in goodness and truth.
O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength unto thy
servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.
Shew some token upon me for good, that they who hate me may see it and be
ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
<h3>Psalm 86</h3>
A psalm of a song for the sons of Core
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loveth the gates of Sion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Very excellent things are spoken of thee: thou city of God.
I will think upon Rahab and Babylon: with them that know me.
Behold ye the Philistines also: and they of Tyre, with the Morians; lo, there was
he born.
And of Sion it shall be reported that he was born in her: and the most High shall
stablish her.
The Lord shall rehearse it when he writeth up the people: that he was born
there.
The singers also and trumpeters shall he rehearse: All my fresh springs shall be
in thee.
<h3>Psalm 87</h3>
A song of a psalm for the sons of Core. For the end. Upon Maeleth, for responsive strains.
Concerning instruction for Æman the Israelite
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: O let my
prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling.
For my soul is full of trouble: and my life draweth nigh unto hell.
I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit: and I have been even as a
man that hath no strength.
Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded, and lie in the grave: who
are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit: in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
Thine indignation lieth hard upon me: and thou hast vexed me with all thy
storms.
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me: and made me to be
abhorred of them.
I am so fast in prison: that I cannot get forth.
My sight faileth for very trouble: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have
stretched forth my hands unto thee.
Dost thou shew wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise up again, and
praise thee?
Shall thy loving-kindness be shewed in the grave: or thy faithfulness in
destruction?
Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy righteousness in the
land where all things are forgotten?
Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come before thee.
Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face from me?
I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die: even from my youth
up thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me: and the fear of thee hath undone me.
They came round about me daily like water: and compassed me together on
every side.
My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me: and hid mine acquaintance
out of my sight.

<h3>Psalm 88</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Ætham the Israelite
MY SONG shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the Lord: with my mouth will I
ever be shewing thy truth from one generation to another.
For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever: thy truth shalt thou stablish in the
heavens.
I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn unto David my servant;
Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne from one generation to
another.
O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and thy truth in the
congregation of the saints.
For who is he among the clouds: that shall be compared unto the Lord?
And what is he among the gods: that shall be like unto the Lord?
God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints: and to be had in
reverence of all them that are round about him.
O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee: thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on
every side.
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.
Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it: thou hast scattered thine enemies
abroad with thy mighty arm.
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast laid the foundation of
the round world, and all that therein is.
Thou hast made the north and the south: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy
Name.
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat: mercy and truth shall go
before thy face.
Blessed is the people, O Lord, that can rejoice in thee: they shall walk in the light
of thy countenance.
Their delight shall be daily in thy Name: and in thy righteousness shall they
make their boast.
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy loving-kindness thou shalt lift
up our horns.
For the Lord is our defence: the Holy One of Israel is our King.
Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help
upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
I have found David my servant: with my holy oil have I anointed him.
My hand shall hold him fast: and my arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not be able to do him violence: the son of wickedness shall not
hurt him.
I will smite down his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.
My truth also and my mercy shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be
exalted.
I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand in the floods.
He shall call me, Thou art my Father: my God, and my strong salvation.
And I will make him my first-born: higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast with
him.
His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the days of
heaven.
But if his children forsake my law: and walk not in my judgements;
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I will visit their
offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.
Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my
truth to fail.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: I
have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David.
His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the sun before me.
He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the faithful witness in
heaven.
But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed: and art displeased at him.
Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his crown to the ground.
Thou hast overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong holds.
All they that go by spoil him: and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all his adversaries to
rejoice.
Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword: and givest him not victory in the
battle.
Thou hast put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: and covered him with dishonour.
Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever: and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
O remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men for
nought?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death: and shall he deliver his soul
from the hand of hell?
Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses: which thou swarest unto David in thy
truth?
Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I do bear in my
bosom the rebukes of many people.
Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of
thine Anointed: Praised be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 89</h3>
A prayer of Moses the man of God
LORD, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of
men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a
watch in the night.
As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut down,
dried up and withered.
For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance.
For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our years to an end, as
it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong
that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but labour and
sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.
But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man feareth,
so is thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be glad all the
days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us: and for the years
wherein we have suffered adversity.
Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou the work
of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handywork.
<h3>Psalm 90</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the most High: shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty..
I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my strong hold: my God, in him
will I trust.
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome
pestilence.
He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers:
his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by
day;
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness that destroyeth
in the noon-day.
A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall
not come nigh thee.
Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold: and see the reward of the ungodly.
For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of defence very high.
There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou
tread under thy feet.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him
up, because he hath known my Name.
He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble; I will
deliver him, and bring him to honour.
With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation.

Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen:  that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was  no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the LORD; and beside  me there is no savior. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when  (there was) no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the  LORD, that I am God. Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can  deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it? Thus saith the LORD, your  Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have  brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. Thus  saith the Lord. The Holy One of Israel </p><h3>THE READING IS FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON </h3><p>The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God, and there shall no torment  touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die, and their departure is  taken for misery, and their going from us to be utter destruction, but they are in  peace. For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of  immortality. And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded, for  God proved them and found them worthy for Himself. As gold in the furnace hath  He tried them, and received them as a burnt offering. And in the time of their  visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. They  shall judge the nations and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign  for ever. They that put their trust in Him shall understand the truth; and such as be  faithful in love shall abide with Him; for grace and mercy is to His saints and  visitation for His elect.  </p><h3>THE READING IS FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON </h3><p>The righteous live unto the ages; their reward is also with the Lord, and the care  of them is with the most High. Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom and a  beautiful crown from the Lord’s hand, for with His right hand shall He cover them,  and with His arm shall He protect them. He shall take to Him His jealousy for  complete armor, and make the creature His weapon for the revenge of His enemies.  He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate and true judgment instead of an helmet.  He shall take holiness for an invincible shield. His severe wrath shall He sharpen for a  sword, and the world shall fight with Him against the unwise. Then shall the right- arming thunderbolts go abroad, and from the clouds, as from a well-drawn bow, shall  they fly to the mark. And from the hailstones full of wrath and cast as out of a sIn  Tone bow the cities shall fall down, and the water of the sea shall rage against them,  and the floods shall cruelly drown them. Yea, a mighty wind shall stand up against  them, and like a storm shall blow them away; thus iniquity shall lay waste the whole  earth, and ill dealing shall overthrow the Thrones of the mighty. Hear therefore, O ye  kings, and understand; learn ye that be judges of the ends of the earth.

<h3>Psalm 91</h3>
A psalm of a song for the Sabbath-day
IT IS a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy
Name, O most Highest.
To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning: and of thy truth in the nightseason.
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute: upon a loud instrument,
and upon the harp.
For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works: and I will rejoice in giving
praise for the operations of thy hands.
O Lord, how glorious are thy works: thy thoughts are very deep.
An unwise man doth not well consider this: and a fool doth not understand it.
When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish: then shall they be destroyed for ever; but thou,
Lord, art the most Highest for evermore.
For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, lo, thine enemies shall perish: and all the workers
of wickedness shall be destroyed.
But mine horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn: for I am anointed with
fresh oil.
Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies: and mine ear shall hear his
desire of the wicked that arise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar
in Libanus.
Such as are planted in the house of the Lord: shall flourish in the courts of the
house of our God.
They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age: and shall be fat and wellliking.
That they may shew how true the Lord my strength is: and that there is no
unrighteousness in him.
<h3>Psalm 92</h3>
For the day before the Sabbath. When the land was first inhabited, the praise of a song by David
THE Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his
apparel, and girded himself with strength.
He hath made the round world so sure: that it cannot be moved.
Ever since the world began hath thy seat been prepared: thou art from
everlasting.
The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lift up their voice: the floods lift up
their waves.
The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly: but yet the Lord, who
dwelleth on high, is mightier.
Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becometh thine house for ever.
<h3>Psalm 93</h3>
A psalm of David for the fourth day of the week
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth: thou God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself.
Arise, thou Judge of the world: and reward the proud after their deserving.
Lord, how long shall the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly triumph?
How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully: and make such proud
boasting?
They smite down thy people, O Lord: and trouble thine heritage.
They murder the widow and the stranger: and put the fatherless to death.
And yet they say, Tush, the Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob
regard it.
Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the eye, shall he not
see?
Or he that nurtureth the heathen: it is he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not
he punish?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man: that they are but vain.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him in thy law.
That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity: until the pit be digged
up for the ungodly.
For the Lord will not fail his people: neither will he forsake his inheritance;
Until righteousness turn again unto judgement: all such as are true in heart shall
follow it.
Who will rise up with me against the wicked: or who will take my part against
the evil-doers?
If the Lord had not helped me: it had not failed but my soul had been put to
silence.
But when I said, My foot hath slipt: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.
In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart: thy comforts have
refreshed my soul.
Wilt thou have any thing to do with the stool of wickedness: which imagineth
mischief as a law?
They gather them together against the soul of the righteous: and condemn the
innocent blood.
But the Lord is my refuge: and my God is the strength of my confidence.
He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own
malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

<h3>Psalm 94</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
O COME, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our
salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: and shew ourselves glad in
him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God: and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hills is his
also.
The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep
of his hand.
To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the provocation,
and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: It is a people that
do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways;
Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.
<h3>Psalm 95</h3>
When the house was built after the captivity. A song by David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the whole earth.
Sing unto the Lord, and praise his Name: be telling of his salvation from day to
day.
Declare his honour unto the heathen: and his wonders unto all people.
For the Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised: he is more to be feared
than all gods.
As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols: but it is the Lord that made
the heavens.
Glory and worship are before him: power and honour are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people: ascribe unto the Lord
worship and power.
Ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his Name: bring presents, and come
into his courts.
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let the whole earth stand in awe of
him.
Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King: and that it is he who hath
made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; and how that he
shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea make a noise, and
all that therein is.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood
rejoice before the Lord.
For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: and with righteousness to judge
the world, and the people with his truth.
<h3>Psalm 96</h3>
For David, when his land is established
THE Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
may be glad thereof.
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgement are the
habitation of his seat.
There shall go a fire before him: and burn up his enemies on every side.
His lightnings gave shine unto the world: the earth saw it, and was afraid.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord
of the whole earth.
The heavens have declared his righteousness: and all the people have seen his
glory.
Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in vain
gods: worship him, all ye gods.
Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad, because of
thy judgements, O Lord.
For thou, Lord, art higher than all that are in the earth: thou art exalted far
above all gods.
O ye that love the Lord, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: the Lord
preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of
the ungodly.
There is sprung up a light for the righteous: and the joyful gladness for such as
are true-hearted.
Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous: and give thanks for a remembrance of his
holiness.

<h3>Psalm 97</h3>
A Psalm of David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous things.
With his own right hand, and with his holy arm: hath he gotten himself the
victory.
The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the
sight of the heathen.
He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel: and all the
ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.
Shew yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing, rejoice, and give thanks.
Praise the Lord upon the harp: sing to the harp with a psalm of thanksgiving.
With trumpets also and shawms: O shew yourselves joyful before the Lord the
King.
Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round world, and they that
dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together before the
Lord: for he is come to judge the earth.
With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with equity.
<h3>Psalm 98</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord is King, be the people never so unpatient: he sitteth between the
cherubims, be the earth never so unquiet.
The Lord is great in Sion: and high above all people.
They shall give thanks unto thy Name: which is great, wonderful, and holy.
The King's power loveth judgement; thou hast prepared equity: thou hast
executed judgement and righteousness in Jacob.
O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before his footstool, for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call upon his
Name: these called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar: for they kept his testimonies, and
the law that he gave them.
Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou forgavest them, O God, and
punishedst their own inventions.
O magnify the Lord our God, and worship him upon his holy hill: for the Lord our
God is holy.
<h3>Psalm 99</h3>
A psalm for thanksgiving
O BE joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come
before his presence with a song.
Be ye sure that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we
ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:
be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.
For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting: and his truth endureth from
generation to generation.
<h3>Psalm 100</h3>
A Psalm of David
MY SONG shall be of mercy and judgement: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.
O let me have understanding: in the way of godliness.
When wilt thou come unto me: I will walk in my house with a perfect heart.
I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of unfaithfulness: there shall
no such cleave unto me.
A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour: him will I destroy.
Whoso hath also a proud look and high stomach: I will not suffer him.
Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land: that they may dwell with
me.
Whoso leadeth a godly life: he shall be my servant.
There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house: he that telleth lies shall not
tarry in my sight.
I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land: that I may root out all
wicked doers from the city of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 101</h3>
A prayer for the poor, when he is deeply afflicted and pours out his supplication before the Lord
HEAR my prayer, O Lord: and let my crying come unto thee.
Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine ear unto me
when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.
For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt up as it
were a firebrand.
My heart is smitten down, and withered liked grass: so that I forget to eat my
bread.
For the voice of my groaning: my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.
I am become like a pelican in the wilderness: and like an owl that is in the desert.
I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that sitteth alone upon the
house-top.
Mine enemies revile me all the day long: and they that are mad upon me are
sworn together against me.
For I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping.
And that because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and
cast me down.
My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.
But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever: and thy remembrance throughout all
generations.
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that thou have mercy
upon her, yea, the time is come.
And why? thy servants think upon her stones: and it pitieth them to see her in
the dust.
The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy
majesty;
When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall appear;
When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute: and despiseth not
their desire.
This shall be written for those that come after: and the people which shall be
born shall praise the Lord.
For he hath looked down from his sanctuary: out of the heaven did the Lord
behold the earth;
That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity: and deliver the
children appointed unto death;
That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion: and his worship at
Jerusalem;
When the people are gathered together: and the kingdoms also, to serve the
Lord.
He brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.
But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age: as for thy
years, they endure throughout all generations.
Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax old as doth a
garment;
And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art
the same, and thy years shall not fail.
The children of thy servants shall continue: and their seed shall stand fast in thy
sight.
<h3>Psalm 102</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me praise his holy Name.
Praise the Lord, O my soul: and forget not all his benefits;
Who forgiveth all thy sin: and healeth all thine infirmities;
Who saveth thy life from destruction: and crowneth thee with mercy and lovingkindness;
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: making thee young and lusty as an
eagle.
The Lord executeth righteousness and judgement: for all them that are
oppressed with wrong.
He shewed his ways unto Moses: his works unto the children of Israel.
The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and of great goodness.
He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth he his anger for ever.
He hath not dealt with us after our sins: nor rewarded us according to our
wickednesses.
For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth: so great is his mercy
also toward them that fear him.
Look how wide also the east is from the west: so far hath he set our sins from us.
Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children: even so is the Lord merciful unto
them that fear him.
For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that we are but dust.
The days of man are but as grass: for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.
For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone: and the place thereof shall know
it no more.
But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon them that
fear him: and his righteousness upon children's children;
Even upon such as keep his covenant: and think upon his commandments to do
them.
The Lord hath prepared his seat in heaven: and his kingdom ruleth over all.
O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength: ye that fulfil his
commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words.
O praise the Lord, all ye his hosts: ye servants of his that do his pleasure.
O speak good of the Lord, all ye works of his, in all places of his dominion: praise
thou the Lord, O my soul.

<h3>Psalm 103</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art become exceeding
glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.
Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment: and spreadest out the
heavens like a curtain.
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: and maketh the clouds his
chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.
He maketh his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire.
He laid the foundations of the earth: that it never should move at any time.
Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment: the waters stand in the
hills.
At thy rebuke they flee: at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.
They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath: even unto the
place which thou hast appointed for them.
Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass: neither turn again to
cover the earth.
He sendeth the springs into the rivers: which run among the hills.
All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild asses quench their thirst.
Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation: and sing among the
branches.
He watereth the hills from above: the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
He bringeth forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the service of men;
That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of
man: and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen
man's heart.
The trees of the Lord also are full of sap: even the cedars of Libanus which he
hath planted;
Wherein the birds make their nests: and the fir-trees are a dwelling for the stork.
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats: and so are the stony rocks for the
conies.
He appointed the moon for certain seasons: and the sun knoweth his going down.
Thou makest darkness that it may be night: wherein all the beasts of the forest
do move.
The lions roaring after their prey: do seek their meat from God.
The sun ariseth, and they get them away together: and lay them down in their
dens.
Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour: until the evening.
O Lord, how manifold are thy works: in wisdom hast thou made them all; the
earth is full of thy riches.
So is the great and wide sea also: wherein are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great beasts.
There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan: whom thou hast made to take his
pastime therein.
These wait all upon thee: that thou mayest give them meat in due season.
When thou givest it them they gather it: and when thou openest thy hand they
are filled with good.
When thou hidest thy face they are troubled: when thou takest away their breath
they die, and are turned again to their dust.
When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made: and thou shalt renew
the face of the earth.
The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in
his works.
The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch the hills, they shall
smoke.
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will praise my God while I have my
being.
And so shall my words please him: my joy shall be in the Lord.
As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall
come to an end: praise thou the Lord, O my soul, praise the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 104</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his Name: tell the people what
things he hath done.
O let your songs be of him, and praise him: and let your talking be of all his
wondrous works.
Rejoice in his holy Name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek the Lord and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Remember the marvellous works that he hath done: his wonders, and the
judgements of his mouth.
O ye seed of Abraham his servant: ye children of Jacob his chosen.
He is the Lord our God: his judgements are in all the world.
He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise: that he made to a
thousand generations;
Even the covenant that he made with Abraham: and the oath that he sware unto
Isaac;
And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law: and to Israel for an everlasting
testament;
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan: the lot of your inheritance;
When there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in the land;
What time as they went from one nation to another: from one kingdom to another
people;
He suffered no man to do them wrong: but reproved even kings for their sakes;
Touch not mine Anointed: and do my prophets no harm.
Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land: and destroyed all the provision of
bread.
But he had sent a man before them: even Joseph, who was sold to be a bondservant;
Whose feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his soul;
Until the time came that his cause was known: the word of the Lord tried him.
The king sent, and delivered him: the prince of the people let him go free.
He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his substance;
That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach his senators wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people exceedingly: and made them stronger than their
enemies.
Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people: and dealt untruly with his
servants.
Then sent he Moses his servant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.
And these shewed his tokens among them: and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and it was dark: and they were not obedient unto his word.
He turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs: yea, even in their kings' chambers.
He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies: and lice in all their
quarters.
He gave them hail-stones for rain: and flames of fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and fig-trees: and destroyed the trees that were in
their coasts.
He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable:
and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their
ground.
He smote all the first-born in their land: even the chief of all their strength.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person
among their tribes.
Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were afraid of them.
He spread out a cloud to be a covering: and fire to give light in the night-season.
At their desire he brought quails: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in the
dry places.
For why? he remembered his holy promise: and Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy: and his chosen with gladness.
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people
in possession;
That they might keep his statutes: and observe his laws.

Blessed art thou and well it is with thee, for now, in thy heavenly dwelling where the legions of the righteous, the multitude of the Martyrs and the choirs of the most wise Apostles abide, thou dost with them cry aloud: “Blessed is the God of our Fathers”.  </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thou alone, O most pure Virgin, hath become known as a Mother who knew not wedlock, and the Mother of Him Who created everything in His wisdom; wherefore we fervently call unto thee, saying: “Blessed art thou who hast given birth to God in the flesh”.  </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> God Who descended into the fiery furnace * with the Hebrew children, * and transformed the flame into dew, * do ye works hymn, * and supremely exalt as Lord throughout all ages. With fervor didst thou execute the ministry of the mysteries of Christ, and like a spiritual lamb offered thyself unto Him as an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice, perfected with the spilling of thy blood, O most blessed one.  Adorning thy Hierarchical vestments with virtues, O most wise one, thou didst manifest thyself as a guardian of chastity, a partaker of the true food of abstinence, a teacher of prayer, and an instructor of repentance and law, unto eternal life.  At the time of our oblation, let us always bring forth fruit worthy of repentance, since the barren fig-tree lives ever threatened of being cut off; Fear such a curse O my soul, and worthily receive Christ, the abundant fruit of virtue.  </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O most venerated defender of Christian peoples, do not despise the voice of us thy servants and deliver us, O holy Virgin, from every danger and from every cruel advance of the enemy, for thy motherly intercessions ever incline God to mercy.  </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The Son of the Beginningless Father, God and Lord, * hath appeared to us incarnate of a Virgin, * to enlighten those in darkness, * and to gather the dispersed; * therefore the all-hymned Theotokos do we magnify Thou, O Father, hast destroyed the many and varied arrows of the enemy by the fire of abstinence, burning up the corruption of the flesh with the coals of chastity, wherefore thou wast gloriously deemed worthy of the true purity that exists on high.  Thy radiant memory, O Father, hath shone forth, illuminating the souls of those who reverently celebrate it, rendering them, O right wondrous one, partakers of the divine light; wherefore we offer thee hymns, O divinely-wise one.  Thou, O Father, having received from the right hand of God the reward of thy victory art now adorned with the crown of martyrdom, for finishing thine exploits and resplendent with the divine light, we the faithful now offer thee unto Christ as our fervent intercessor.  </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Virgin and Mother of the Word, the true Theotokos, our mediatrix, thou hast brought forth unto us the eternal Life of God and the Sun of righteousness, Whom we the faithful with one mind magnify in spiritual songs.  </p>

O Nicholas, initiate of the sacred mysteries, who delivered the three generals from death by thine awesome appearance, deliver us also from all deadly harm.

With the power of God ye broke the jaws of the soul-destroying lions, O apostles, for ye were ordained by Christ to be princes on earth, piously submitting in hymnody to this Spirit; wherefore, make the disorderly movements of my heart subject to the laws of God. Preaching the Word of God, Who is more comely than all the sons of mankind, and Who appeared in the world, ye made beautiful your feet, as ones proclaiming peace and life; wherefore, by your prayers bring peace to my soul, which is troubled by the passions. Having mortified your members on earth, ye clothed yourselves in all life, emulating the honored Passion by your sufferings; wherefore, O divinely blessed apostles, with the remedy of true repentance give life to me who have been wounded by the darts of the evil one’s malice. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> In that thou art merciful, O thou who hast given birth to the supremely good God, heal my soul, which hath become sick through grievous passions; and ever deliver me from enemies who goad and attack me, O most pure one, that, saved, I may diligently magnify thee, whom our generation hath magnified. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of Saint Nicholas </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Saved by thee, O pure Virgin, * we confess thee to be truly the Theotokos, * and together with the choirs of the bodiless hosts * thee do we magnify.

        <h3>THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS (13: 7-16)</h3><p>Brethren: Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto 
you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation. 
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. Be not carried about with 
divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with 
grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. 
We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. For 
the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high 
priest for sin, are burned without the camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that he might 
sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. Let us go forth 
therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. For here have we no 
continuing city, but we seek one to come. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of 
praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of (our) lips giving thanks to his name. But 
to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well 
pleased.

righteous shall rejoice.

<h3>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE (12:2-12)</h3><p>The Lord said: There is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, 
that shall not be known. Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be 
heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be 
proclaimed upon the housetops. And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of 
them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will 
forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to 
cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. Are not five sparrows sold for two 
farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? But even the very hairs of 
your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many 
sparrows. Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the 
Son of man also confess before the angels of God: But he that denieth me before 
men shall be denied before the angels of God. And whosoever shall speak a word 
against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth 
against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven. And when they bring you unto the 
synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing 
ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same 
hour what ye ought to say.

<h3>Psalm 105</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for
ever.
Who can express the noble acts of the Lord: or shew forth all his praise?
Blessed are they that alway keep judgement: and do righteousness.
Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation;
That I may see the felicity of thy chosen: and rejoice in the gladness of thy
people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers: we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly.
Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great
goodness in remembrance: but were disobedient at the sea, even at the
Red sea.
Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake: that he might make his power
to be known.
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the
deep, as through a wilderness.
And he saved them from the adversaries' hand: and delivered them from the
hand of the enemy.
As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them: there was not
one of them left.
Then believed they his words: and sang praise unto him.
But within a while they forgat his works: and would not abide his counsel.
But lust came upon them in the wilderness: and they tempted God in the desert.
And he gave them their desire: and sent leanness withal into their soul.
They angered Moses also in the tents: and Aaron the saint of the Lord.
So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of
Abiram.
And the fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the ungodly.
They made a calf in Horeb: and worshipped the molten image.
Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.
And they forgat God their Saviour: who had done so great things in Egypt;
Wondrous works in the land of Ham: and fearful things by the Red sea.
So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood
before him in the gap: to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should
destroy them.
Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no credence unto his
word;
But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord.
Then lift he up his hand against them: to overthrow them in the wilderness;
To cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves unto Baal-peor: and ate the offerings of the dead.
Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions: and the plague was
great among them.
Then stood up Phinees and prayed: and so the plague ceased.
And that was counted unto him for righteousness: among all posterities for
evermore.
They angered him also at the waters of strife: so that he punished Moses for
their sakes;
Because they provoked his spirit: so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Neither destroyed they the heathen: as the Lord commanded them;
But were mingled among the heathen: and learned their works.
Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay: yea,
they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters:
whom they had offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled
with blood.
Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring with their own
inventions.
Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people: insomuch that
he abhorred his own inheritance.
And he gave them over into the hands of the heathen: and they that hated them
were lords over them.
Their enemies oppressed them: and had them in subjection.
Many a time did he deliver them: but they rebelled against him with their own
inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.
Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity: he heard their complaint.
He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude of
his mercies: yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity
them.
Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen: that we may
give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world without end: and
let all the people say, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 106</h3>
Alleluia
Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed: and delivered from the
hand of the enemy;
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west: from the
north and from the south.
They went astray in the wilderness out of the way: and found no city to dwell in;
Hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.
So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: and he delivered them from their
distress.
He led them forth by the right way: that they might go to the city where they
dwelt.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he satisfieth the empty soul: and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: being fast bound in misery
and iron ;
Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly regarded the
counsel of the most Highest;
He also brought down their heart through heaviness: they fell down, and there
was none to help them.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death: and brake
their bonds in sunder.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he hath broken the gates of brass: and smitten the bars of iron in sunder.
Foolish men are plagued for their offence: and because of their wickedness.
Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they were even hard at death's door.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
He sent his word, and healed them: and they were saved from their destruction.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving: and tell out his
works with gladness!
They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their business in great waters;
These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.
For at his word the stormy wind ariseth: which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep: their soul
melteth away because of the trouble.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are at their wits' end.
So when thy cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivereth them out of their
distress.
For he maketh the storm to cease: so that the waves thereof are still.
Then are they glad, because they are at rest: and so he bringeth them unto the
haven where they would be.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people: and praise him
in the seat of the elders!
Who turneth the floods into a wilderness: and drieth up the water-springs.
A fruitful land maketh he barren: for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water: and water-springs of a dry
ground.
And there he setteth the hungry: that they may build them a city to dwell in.
That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards: to yield them fruits of
increase.
He blesseth them so that they multiply exceedingly: and suffereth not their cattle
to decrease.
And again, when they are minished and brought low: through oppression,
through any plague or trouble;
Though he suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants: and let them wander
out of the way in the wilderness.
Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery: and maketh him households like a flock of
sheep.
The righteous will consider this, and rejoice: and the mouth of all wickedness
shall be stopped.
Whoso is wise will ponder these things: and they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 107</h3>
Song of a psalm by David
O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing and give praise with the
best member that I have.
Awake, thou lute, and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing praises unto
thee among the nations.
For thy mercy is greater than the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
That thy beloved may be delivered: let thy right hand save them, and hear thou
me.
God hath spoken in his holiness: I will rejoice therefore, and divide Sichem, and
mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head.
Judah is my law-giver, Moab is my wash-pot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe,
upon Philistia will I triumph.
Who will lead me into the strong city: and who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou forsaken us, O God: and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our
hosts?
O help us against the enemy: for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do great acts: and it is he that shall tread down our
enemies.
<h3>Psalm 108</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise: for the mouth of the ungodly, yea, the
mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.
And they have spoken against me with false tongues: they compassed me about
also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part: but I give
myself unto prayer.
Thus have they rewarded me evil for good: and hatred for my good will.
Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand.
When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned: and let his prayer be
turned into sin.
Let his days be few: and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless: and his wife a widow.
Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread: let them seek it also out of
desolate places.
Let the extortioner consume all that he hath: and let the stranger spoil his
labour.
Let there be no man to pity him: nor to have compassion upon his fatherless
children.
Let his posterity be destroyed: and in the next generation let his name be clean
put out.
Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight of the Lord:
and let not the sin of his mother be done away.
Let them alway be before the Lord: that he may root out the memorial of them
from off the earth.
And that, because his mind was not to do good: but persecuted the poor helpless
man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.
His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him: he loved not blessing,
therefore shall it be far from him.
He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a raiment: and it shall come into his
bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be unto him as the cloke that he hath upon him: and as the girdle that he is
alway girded withal.
Let it thus happen from the Lord unto mine enemies: and to those that speak evil
against my soul.
But deal thou with me, O Lord God, according unto thy Name: for sweet is thy
mercy.
O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor: and my heart is wounded within me.
I go hence like the shadow that departeth: and am driven away as the
grasshopper.
My knees are weak through fasting: my flesh is dried up for want of fatness.
I became also a reproach unto them: they that looked upon me shaked their
heads.
Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy.
And they shall know, how that this is thy hand: and that thou, Lord, hast done it.
Though they curse, yet bless thou: and let them be confounded that rise up
against me; but let thy servant rejoice.
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame: and let them cover themselves with
their own confusion, as with a cloke.
As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth: and praise him
among the multitude.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor: to save his soul from the
unrighteous judges.

         </p><h3>THE READING IS FROM ISAIAH </h3><p>Thus saith the Lord: Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people  be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them  bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: our let them hear, and say, It is  truth. Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen:  that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was  no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the LORD; and beside  me there is no savior. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when  (there was) no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the  LORD, that I am God. Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can  deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it? Thus saith the LORD, your  Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have  brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. Thus  saith the Lord. The Holy One of Israel </p><h3>THE READING IS FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON </h3><p>The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God, and there shall no torment  touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die, and their departure is  taken for misery, and their going from us to be utter destruction, but they are in  peace. For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of  immortality. And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded, for  God proved them and found them worthy for Himself. As gold in the furnace hath  He tried them, and received them as a burnt offering. And in the time of their  visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. They  shall judge the nations and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign  for ever. They that put their trust in Him shall understand the truth; and such as be  faithful in love shall abide with Him; for grace and mercy is to His saints and  visitation for His elect.  </p><h3>THE READING IS FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON </h3><p>The righteous live unto the ages; their reward is also with the Lord, and the care  of them is with the most High. Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom and a  beautiful crown from the Lord’s hand, for with His right hand shall He cover them,  and with His arm shall He protect them. He shall take to Him His jealousy for  complete armor, and make the creature His weapon for the revenge of His enemies.  He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate and true judgment instead of an helmet.  He shall take holiness for an invincible shield. His severe wrath shall He sharpen for a  sword, and the world shall fight with Him against the unwise. Then shall the right- arming thunderbolts go abroad, and from the clouds, as from a well-drawn bow, shall  they fly to the mark. And from the hailstones full of wrath and cast as out of a sIn  Tone bow the cities shall fall down, and the water of the sea shall rage against them,  and the floods shall cruelly drown them. Yea, a mighty wind shall stand up against  them, and like a storm shall blow them away; thus iniquity shall lay waste the whole  earth, and ill dealing shall overthrow the Thrones of the mighty. Hear therefore, O ye  kings, and understand; learn ye that be judges of the ends of the earth. Give ear, ye  that rule the people and glory in the multitude of nations, for power is given you of  the Lord and sovereignty from the Highest.

<h3>Psalm 134</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, laud ye the Name of the Lord: praise it, O ye servants of the
Lord;
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord: in the courts of the house of our God.
O praise the Lord, for the Lord is gracious: O sing praises unto his Name, for it is
lovely.
For why? the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself: and Israel for his own
possession.
For I know that the Lord is great: and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth: and in the sea,
and in all deep places.
He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world: and sendeth forth
lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his treasures.
He smote the first-born of Egypt: both of man and beast.
He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of Egypt:
upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.
He smote divers nations: and slew mighty kings;
Sehon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Basan: and all the kingdoms of
Canaan;
And gave their land to be an heritage: even an heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever: so doth thy memorial, O Lord, from one
generation to another.
For the Lord will avenge his people: and be gracious unto his servants.
As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold: the work of men's
hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, but they see not.
They have ears, and yet they hear not: neither is there any breath in their
mouths.
They that make them are like unto them: and so are all they that put their trust
in them.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Israel: praise the Lord, ye house of Aaron.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, praise the Lord.
Praised be the Lord out of Sion: who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
<h3>Psalm 135</h3>
Alleluia
O give thanks unto the God of all gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O thank the Lord of all lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who only doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who by his excellent wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who laid out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who hath made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The sun to rule the day: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The moon and the stars to govern the night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote Egypt with their first-born: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever;
With a mighty hand, and stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who divided the Red sea in two parts: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And made Israel to go through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever.
But as for Pharaoh and his host, he overthrew them in the Red sea: for his mercy
endureth for ever.
Who led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Yea, and slew mighty kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Sehon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And Og the king of Basan: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And gave away their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Even for an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who remembered us when we were in trouble: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And hath delivered us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 136</h3>
For David. A psalm of Jeremias
BY THE waters of Babylon we sat down and wept: when we remembered thee, O
Sion.
As for our harps, we hanged them up: upon the trees that are therein.
For they that led us away captive required of us then a song, and melody in our
heaviness: Sing us one of the songs of Sion.
How shall we sing the Lord's song: in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem: let my right hand forget her cunning.
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: yea, if I
prefer not Jerusalem in my mirth.
Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem: how they said,
Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.
O daughter of Babylon , wasted with misery: yea, happy shall he be that
rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us.
Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children: and throweth them against the
stones.

<h3>Psalm 137</h3>
A psalm of David, of Aggæus and Zacharias
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: even before the gods
will I sing praise unto thee.
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of thy
loving-kindness and truth: for thou hast magnified thy Name and thy word
above all things.
When I called upon thee, thou heardest me: and enduedst my soul with much
strength.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they have heard the words
of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: that great is the glory of the Lord.
For though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: as for the
proud, he beholdeth them afar off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me: thou shalt
stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy right
hand shall save me.
The lord shall make good his loving-kindness toward me: yea, thy mercy, O Lord,
endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine own hands.
<h3>Psalm 138</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
O LORD, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou knowest my downsitting and mine up-rising, thou understandest my thoughts long before.
Thou art about my path, and about my bed: and spiest out all my ways.
For lo, there is not a word in my tongue: but thou, O Lord, knowest it altogether.
Thou hast fashioned me behind and before: and laid thine hand upon me.
Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me: I cannot attain unto it.
Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit: or whither shall I go then from thy
presence?
If I climb up into heaven, thou art there: if I go down to hell, thou art there also.
If I take the wings of the morning: and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me.
If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall my night be turned
to day.
Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day:
the darkness and light to thee are both alike.
For my reins are thine: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous
are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.
My bones are not hid from thee: though I be made secretly, and fashioned
beneath in the earth.
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect: and in thy book were all
my members written;
Which day by day were fashioned: when as yet there was none of them.
How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God: O how great is the sum of them!
If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: when I wake up I am
present with thee.
Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God: depart from me, ye blood-thirsty men.
For they speak unrighteously against thee: and thine enemies take thy Name in
vain.
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee: and am not I grieved with those that
rise up against thee?
Yea, I hate them right sore: even as though they were mine enemies.
Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart: prove me, and examine my
thoughts.
Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me: and lead me in the way
everlasting.
<h3>Psalm 139</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
DELIVER me, O Lord, from the evil man: and preserve me from the wicked man.
Who imagine mischief in their hearts: and stir up strife all the day long.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: adders' poison is under their
lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly: preserve me from the wicked
men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.
The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with cords: yea, and
set traps in my way.
I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my prayers, O Lord.
O Lord God, thou strength of my health: thou hast covered my head in the day of
the battle.
Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord: let not his mischievous imagination
prosper, lest they be too proud.
Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them: that compass me
about.
Let hot burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire and into the
pit, that they never rise up again.
A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: evil shall hunt the wicked
person to overthrow him.
Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor: and maintain the cause of the
helpless.
The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name: and the just shall continue in
thy sight.

<h3>Psalm 140</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, I call upon thee, haste thee unto me: and consider my voice when I cry
unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense: and let the lifting up of my
hands be an evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and keep the door of my lips.
O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing: let me not be occupied in
ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, lest I eat of such things
as please them.
Let the righteous rather smite me friendly: and reprove me.
But let not their precious balms break my head: yea, I will pray yet against their
wickedness.
Let their judges be overthrown in stony places: that they may hear my words, for
they are sweet.
Our bones lie scattered before the pit: like as when one breaketh and heweth
wood upon the earth.
But mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust , O cast not out my
soul.
Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me: and from the traps of the
wicked doers.
Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together: and let me ever escape them.
<h3>Psalm 141</h3>
A psalm of instruction for David. When he was in the cave; a prayer
I CRIED unto the Lord with my voice: yea, even unto the Lord did I make my
supplication.
I poured out my complaints before him: and shewed him of my trouble.
When my spirit was in heaviness thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I
walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
I looked also upon my right hand: and saw there was no man that would know
me.
I had no place to flee unto: and no man cared for my soul.
I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said: Thou art my hope, and my portion in the land
of the living.
Consider my complaint: for I am brought very low.
O deliver me from my persecutors: for they are too strong for me.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name: which thing if
thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto my company.
<h3>Psalm 142</h3>
A psalm of David when his son pursued him
HEAR my prayer, O Lord, and consider my desire: hearken unto me for thy truth
and righteousness' sake.
And enter not into judgement with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
living be justified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the
ground: he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have been long
dead.
Therefore is my spirit vexed within me: and my heart within me is desolate.
Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works: yea, I exercise
myself in the works of thy hands.
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.
Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint: hide not thy face from
me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for in thee is my trust:
shew thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I flee unto thee to hide me.
Teach me to do a thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God: let thy loving
Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.
Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name's sake: and for thy righteousness' sake bring
my soul out of trouble.
And of thy goodness slay mine enemies: and destroy all them that vex my soul ;
for I am thy servant.

<h3>Psalm 143</h3>
A psalm of David concerning Goliath
BLESSED be the Lord my strength: who teacheth my hands to war, and my
fingers to fight.
My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in whom I trust:
who subdueth my people that is under me.
Lord, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him: or the son of man, that
thou so regardest him?
Man is like a thing of nought: his time passeth away like a shadow.
Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall
smoke.
Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them: shoot out thine arrows, and consume
them.
Send down thine hand from above: deliver me, and take me out of the great
waters, from the hand of strange children.
Whose mouth talketh of vanity: and their right hand is a right hand of
wickedness.
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: and sing praises unto thee upon a tenstringed lute.
Thou hast given victory unto kings: and hast delivered David thy servant from
the peril of the sword.
Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children: whose mouth talketh
of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.
That our sons may grow up as the young plants: and that our daughters may be
as the polished corners of the temple.
That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of store: that our
sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets.

<h3>Psalm 144</h3>
David's Psalm of praise
I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King: and I will praise thy Name for ever and
ever.
Every day will I give thanks unto thee: and praise thy Name for ever and ever.
Great is the Lord, and marvellous worthy to be praised: there is no end of his
greatness.
One generation shall praise thy works unto another: and declare thy power.
As for me, I will be talking of thy worship: thy glory, thy praise, and wondrous
works;
So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts: and I will also tell of
thy greatness.
The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be shewed: and men shall sing of
thy righteousness.
The Lord is gracious and merciful: long-suffering and of great goodness.
The Lord is loving unto every man: and his mercy is over all his works.
All thy works praise thee, O Lord: and thy saints give thanks unto thee.
They shew the glory of thy kingdom: and talk of thy power;
That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom: might be known unto
men.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom: and thy dominion endureth throughout
all ages.
The Lord upholdeth all such as fall: and lifteth up all those that are down.
The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord: and thou givest them their meat in due
season.
Thou openest thine hand: and fillest all things living with plenteousness.
The Lord is righteous in all his ways: and holy in all his works.
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: yea, all such as call upon him
faithfully.
He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will
help them.
The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but scattereth abroad all the
ungodly.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh give thanks unto his
holy Name for ever and ever.

<h3>Psalm 145</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul; while I live will I praise the Lord: yea, as long as I
have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.
O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man: for there is no help in
them.
For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn again to his earth: and then
all his thoughts perish.
Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help: and whose hope is in the
Lord his God;
Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: who keepeth his
promise for ever;
Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong: who feedeth the hungry.
The Lord looseth men out of prison: the Lord giveth sight to the blind.
The Lord helpeth them that are fallen: the Lord careth for the righteous.
The Lord careth for the strangers, he defendeth the fatherless and widow :as for
the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.
The Lord thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore: and throughout all
generations.
<h3>Psalm 146</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God: yea, a
joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: and gather together the out-casts of Israel.
He healeth those that are broken in heart: and giveth medicine to heal their
sickness.
He telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and great is his power: yea, and his wisdom is infinite.
The Lord setteth up the meek: and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground.
O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving: sing praises upon the harp unto our God;
Who covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth: and
maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men;
Who giveth fodder unto the cattle: and feedeth the young ravens that call upon
him.
He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse: neither delighteth he in any
man's legs.
But the Lord's delight is in them that fear him: and put their trust in his mercy.
<h3>Psalm 147</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.
For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates: and hath blessed thy children within
thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: and his word runneth very
swiftly.
He giveth snow like wool: and scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who is able to abide his frost?
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he bloweth with his wind, and the
waters flow.
He sheweth his word unto Jacob: his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with any nation: neither have the heathen knowledge of his
laws.

<h3>Psalm 148</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord of heaven: praise him in the height.
Praise him, all ye angels of his: praise him, all his host.
Praise him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars and light.
Praise him, all ye heavens: and ye waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the Name of the Lord: for he spake the word, and they were
made; he commanded, and they were created.
He hath made them fast for ever and ever: he hath given them a law which shall
not be broken.
Praise the Lord upon earth: ye dragons, and all deeps;
Fire and hail, snow and vapours: wind and storm, fulfilling his word;
Mountains and all hills: fruitful trees and all cedars;
Beasts and all cattle: worms and feathered fowls;
Kings of the earth and all people: princes and all judges of the world;
Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of the Lord: for
his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven and earth.
He shalt exalt the horn of his people; all his saints shall praise him: even the
children of Israel, even the people the serveth him.
<h3>Psalm 149</h3>
Alleluia
O SING unto the Lord a new song: let the congregation of saints praise him.
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: and let the children of Sion be joyful in
their King.
Let them praise his Name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with
tabret and harp.
For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: and helpeth the meek-hearted.
Let the saints be joyful with glory: let them rejoice in their beds.
Let the praises of God be in their mouth: and a two-edged sword in their hands;
To be avenged of the heathen: and to rebuke the people;
To bind their kings in chains: and their nobles with links of iron.
That they may be avenged of them, as it is written: Such honour have all his
saints.
<h3>Psalm 150</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE God in his holiness: praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him in his noble acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.
Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: praise him upon the lute and harp.
Praise him in the cymbals and dances: praise him upon the strings and pipe.
Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: praise him upon the loud cymbals.
Let every thing that hath breath: praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 151</h3>
This psalm is ascribed to David and is outside the number. When he slew Goliath in single
combat.
LITTLE was I among my brethren: a younger brother in my father’s house.
My hands, they made an instrument of music: my fingers, they prepared a
psaltery.
And who shall bring back tidings to my master? The Lord himself, himself gives
ear.
Himself sent forth his messenger: and took me from among my father’s sheep;
and with the oil of his anointing He anointed me.
Comely my brethren were and tall: and yet they found not favor with the Lord.
But I, I sallied forth to meet the alien: and he reviled me by all his idols.
But I drew forth the sword that was beside him: I cut his head off with it, and
from the sons of Israel removed reproach.</div>

Adorning thy Hierarchical vestments with virtues, O most wise one, thou didst manifest thyself as a guardian of chastity, a partaker of the true food of abstinence, a teacher of prayer, and an instructor of repentance and law, unto eternal life.

        </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the precious & life-creating Cross.  </i>The composition of Joseph, in Tone VII: </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Inscribing the invincible weapon of the Cross upon the waters, * Moses marked a straight line before him with his staff * and divided the Red Sea, * opening a path for Israel who went over dry-shod. * Then he marked a second line across the waters * and united them in one, * overwhelming the chariots of Pharaoh. * Therefore let us sing to Christ our God, * for He hath been glorified. Stretching forth Thy divine hands on the Cross, O Jesus, Thou didst gather to Thyself the creation of Thine own hands’, freeing all from the hands of the evil one and subdueing him with Thy mighty hand, O King of all. Wherefore we the faithful hymn Thy majesty, for Thou hast been glorified. Harmful was the bitter eating of the tree in Eden, which brought death upon us; but, dying on the Cross, Christ hath poured forth life upon all, slaying the serpent with His divine power. Wherefore, let us sing to Him, our God, for He hath been glorified! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Waging war, the multitude of the martyrs fought against the passions with Thy Cross and sufferings, O Jesus, and before the enemy they confessed Thee to reign over creation; and they endured tortures and boundless tribulations. Wherefore, they have received the glory of the Lord of glory. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Finding deliverance through the sprinkling of Thy deifying precious blood, O Lord, Thy martyrs truly shed their own blood, and, unjustly tortured, they refused to offer sacrifice to the vile soul-destroying demons. Wherefore, they brought themselves as honorable whole-burnt offerings unto Thee, the King of all. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> When she saw Thee, Who seest all things, nailed to the Cross, the immaculate one said, lamenting: “What is this, O my Child? How have those who enjoyed Thy many gifts rewarded Thee? How can I bear the pain? Glory be to Thy compassion and awesome dispensation, O Long-suffering One!” </p><p><i class="note">Another canon, of the most holy Theotokos, in Tone VII: </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i></i> Having passed through the water as upon dry land, * and having escaped the malice of the Egyptians, * the Israelites cried aloud: * Unto our God and Redeemer let us sing. By thy visitation, O Mother of God, enlighten my soul, which hath been darkened by the pleasures of life and is constantly vexed by the griefs of the world. The gates of heaven have been opened by thy divine birthgiving, O Mother of God. As thou art merciful, grant entry therein to my soul, and guide me to them. O Virgin, by thy mercy heal my soul, which hath been shot by the darts loosed by the evil one and is wounded by his wiles and schemes. As the hope of the hopeless and setting aright of the fallen, O thou who hast given birth to the divine Light, illumine my soul, which is in darkness. </p><h3>Ode III</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The rod of Aaron is an image of this mystery, * for when it budded it showed who should be priest. * So in the Church, that once was barren, * the wood of the Cross hath now budded forth, * filling her with strength and steadfastness. Beholding Thee unjustly suspended upon the Tree, the sun changed its bright vesture to black, the rocks split asunder, and the whole earth quaked, O only Savior, Thou deliverance of all. Stretching out his arms, Moses prefigured the precious Cross; and we, now making the sign thereof with goodly wisdom, vanquish all the alien hordes of the demons, immune to all their harm. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Enduring sufferings, the passion-bearers emulated the suffering of Christ, and they underwent all manner of tortures for the sake of Him Who willingly suffered, slaying the passions and shining forth life upon the world. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Unwaveringly treading the path of torment, the right glorious passion-bearers cast from their hearts the stumbling-blocks of delusiion, and hastened in gladness to the place of divine rest. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “I gave birth to Thee in a manner transcending the ways of men’s laws, O my Child,” the Theotokos declared, weeping; “How then have the iniquitous lifted Thee up upon the Tree in the midst of malefactors, O Thou Who alone set forth the law of life?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Lord, Creator of the vault of Heaven * and Builder of the Church, * do Thou strengthen me in Thy love, O Summit of desire, * O Support of the faithful, * O only Lover of mankind. Grant me loud sighs, ardent tears and a contrite heart, O Virgin, that I may weep over what I have done; and destroy my growing passions, O thou who alone art all-hymned. Rescue my soul, which is heavy with sinful slumber and sunk in the bowels of Hades, O Lady, and grant me the thought of true repentance, O divinely blessed one. Love of contrition and the virtues do thou grant unto my soul, which hath been sunk by my transgressions, that it might love the life of heaven and possess divine desire. On thee do I set my hope, O Mother of God, and I am quickly delivered from despair; for I know, I know the richness of thy tender mercies and the power of thy boldness. </p><h3>Ode IV</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Lord, I have heard the mystery of Thy dispensation; * I have considered Thy works, * and I have glorified Thy Divinity. Bearing piety like the cedar, faith like the cypress, and love like the pine, we bow down before the divine Cross. By Thy Cross paradise hath been opened, O Savior, and man who had been condemned hath entered it again, magnifying Thy goodness. Having died, Thou gavest life to all who had died, and didst slay the serpent who introduced sin. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Emulating the sufferings of Christ, the divine martyrs were shown to share in the radiance of heaven. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Uniting themselves to the beautiful Word, the martyrs were adorned; and, loving the Sun of righteousness, they were splendidly enlightened. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Unto Him Who was perfected before all ages hast thou given birth as a little babe, O all-immaculate Maiden; and He hath perfected all things by His Cross and goodness. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Thou, O Lord, art my strength and Thou art my power, * Thou art my God and Thou art my joy, * Thou Who, while never leaving the bosom of Thy Father, * hast visited our poverty. * Therefore with the Prophet Habbakuk I cry unto Thee, * ‘Glory to Thy power, O Lover of mankind!’ O thou who hast ineffably given birth to God the Word, bind up the wounds of my soul with effective herbs, pouring out upon them the precious blood of thy Son, Who destroyed the soul-corrupting belly of Hades, and poured forth resurrection upon the world. O Bride of God, send down upon my soul the cleansing of transgressions, with streams wash away mine evil thoughts, and grant that it may become pure; for I have fled to thy mediation and help, O Virgin Theotokos. Unto thine aid do I now flee, O most pure one. Go thou before me, to deliver me from the cruel tempest of the enemy and the raging torrents of iniquity; and unerringly guide me to thy haven and thy tranquility, O Mother of God. With darts of sin the enemy hath wounded my whole soul; he hath defiled my heart with pleasures and turned me away from the straight path. Wherefore, I cry unto thee: Turning me back, heal and save me! </p><h3>Ode V</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O thrice-blessed Tree, on which Christ the king and Lord was stretched! * Through thee the beguiler fell, * who tempted mankind with the tree. * He was caught in the trap set by God, * who was crucified upon thee in the flesh, * granting peace unto our souls. Desiring to clothe us with the vesture of incorruption, for we have been stripped naked, Thou wast stripped naked; and crucified upon the Cross, Thou didst lay bare the wiles of the enemy. Wherefore, we glorify Thy sufferings. The saving blood which flowed from His side clearly cleansed the world, abolished the blood of the temples of the idols, restored those made subject to corruption by the fruit of knowledge, and poured forth incorruption upon our souls. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Resplendent in the beauty of their many wounds, and signed with the divine Blood, the glorious martyrs passed by the sword which before barred the way, and have made their abode, rejoicing, in paradise. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> How wonderful art Thou, O Christ, in the saints who loved Thee with faith! For, enriched by Thee, they pour forth upon the world rivers of divine healing, drying up the effluence of our passions. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thou hast healed us who have been afflicted by sin, O most pure Virgin, who hast given birth to the Savior and Physician of all, Who was nailed to the tree of the Cross, and poured forth salvation upon our souls. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Light never-waning, * why hast Thou turned Thy face from me * and why hath the alien darkness surrounded me, * wretched though I be? * But do Thou guide my steps I implore Thee * and turn me back towards the light of Thy commandments. With all diligence I hasten to thine aid, O all-immaculate one, and I lift up the eyes of my soul. Turn not away from me, but help and deliver me, in that thou art good, and wash away the defilement of my transgressions. Deadly poison lay in the fangs of sin, but thou didst supply an antidote thereto in the nails and divine spear of thine Offspring, Who in His tender compassion suffered in the flesh for our sake, O only all-hymned one. Grant life to me, who am slain by mine evil ways and corrupted by my transgressions, O thou who hast given birth to eternal Life; and turn me to incorruption by renewing my soul, O divinely blessed one. Deliver me from the evil of the demons and the malice of men, O Lady who alone hast given birth to the Healer of all flesh and offenses, the Savior and Lord, and quickly heal the pain of my soul and body.   </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Jonah stretched out his hands in the form of a cross * within the belly of the sea monster, * plainly prefiguring the redeeming Passion. * Cast out from thence after three days, * he foreshadowed the marvelous Resurrection of Christ our God, * who was crucified in the flesh and enlightened the world * by His Rising on the third day. The Cross was planted in the midst of the earth at the place of the skull, and healed the sickness caused by the tree which grew in the midst of paradise; for Jesus the Messiah, Who alone is righteous, appeared in the midst of two iniquitous thieves, and with Himself hath raised up all, and cast down into the abyss him who fell headlong from the heights. Drawing the divine bow, Thy precious Cross O Christ, Thou didst loose Thine arrows at the slayer; with the nails of Thy hands Thou didst pierce his wrathful and most polluted heart, O Master; and Thou didst utterly slay him, granting life to those he had slain, O Compassionate One. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With the streams of blood which flowed from the bodies of the holy spiritual athletes they quenched all the flame of the madness of idolatry by the Spirit, watered the furrows of the honored Church, and caused the grain of salvation, hope and love to grow, wherewith every soul is nourished by divine grace. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The character of the glorious suffering passion-bearers was enflamed more than with fire, when the evil judges sentenced them to be consumed by material fire; but they were preserved unharmed through the activity and grace of the Holy Spirit, Who crowned them who suffered lawfully. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> A sword pierced thy heart, O most pure Maiden, when thou didst see thy Son stretched out on the Cross, enduring sufferings, willingly pierced in His divine side by the spear, and slaying the adverse serpent of darkness; wherefore, weeping maternally, thou didst magnify Him. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Cleanse me, O Savior, * for many are mine iniquities; * lead me up from the abyss of evils I pray Thee, * for unto Thee have I cried, * and Thou hast hearkened unto me, * O God of my salvation.  Living in fornication, I have fallen away from God. I have become a wretched slave to pleasures, and am stripped bare of all the divine virtues. But visit me, O most pure one. I have shunned the commandments given me, and, having withdrawn from life, I have drawn nigh unto death. But instruct me to return, O most pure Mother of God. My life is wicked, full of indifference, but thy mercy is great and ineffable, O most pure one. Let the tender compassion of thy goodness prevail over my weak mind. O pure one, who hast given birth to the compassionate Savior and Redeemer, have pity on me, and save and deliver me from those who surround me and mercilessly attack my weakness. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The senseless decree of the wicked tyrant, * breathing forth threats and blasphemy hateful to God, * confused the people. * Yet neither the fury of the wild beast nor the roaring of the fire * could frighten the three Children: * but standing together in the flame, * fanned by the wind that brought the dew as refreshment, they sang: * ‘Blessed and supremely praised art Thou, * O our God and the God of our fathers.’ When Thou wast stretched out upon the tree of the Cross like a grape-vine, O Word of the Father, mystically exuding the wine which doeth away with the drunkenness of disobedience gladdening all who acknowledge Thee to be God the Creator, Who willingly suffered. And it saveth those who chant: O all-hymned God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! Thou didst endure the mockery of crucifixion, O Christ my God, bringing an end to the reproaches and sighing of men; Thou didst eat gall, transforming all the bitterness of evil; and Thou didst suffer Thy hands to be wounded, healing the wounds of our souls, O Compassionate One, and commanding us to chant: O all- hymned God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With your pangs, O valiant spiritual athletes, ye gained the life which is devoid of pain; wherefore, having received from on high the grace to heal our sufferings and dispel evil spirits, ye ease our pains, O holy ones; and standing forth before the faithful, ye save those who cry: O all-hymned God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye stood before the tribunal, confessing Christ Who for our sake assumed flesh like ours, though without corruption, O martyrs; and truly showing yourselves to be emulators of His sufferings, ye endured fire and all other tortures, crying out in gladness: O all- hymned God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “I was filled with grief, beholding Thee, my Son, suffering unjustly; and I was wounded in soul when by the spear Thou wast pierced in the side,” weeping and lamenting the Theotokos, the only Lady, cried out, whom we all call blessed as is meet, piously crying aloud: O all-hymned God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The Hebrew children in the furnace * boldly trampled upon the flames, * changing the fire into dew, they cried aloud: * 'Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, throughout the ages'.  Having received the never-waning Light, O pure Virgin, thou art wholly radiant, and dost illumine those who cry to thee with faith: Blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, O most pure one! That thou mightest show forth thy mercy and love for mankind, O Virgin, lead me up from the depths of evils, who cry out: Blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, O most pure one! Wounded by soul-destroying darts, unto thee do I flee, O Virgin Mother. By thy prayer wholly protect me, who cry aloud: Blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, O most pure one! O Mother of the Savior, deliver me, who am held fast by cruel captivity, evil thoughts and sinful guilt, that, saved, I may ever glorify thee as is meet. </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O ye Children, equal in number to the Trinity, * bless ye God the Father and creator; * sing ye the praises of the Word who descended and changed the fire into dew; * and supremely exalt ye throughout the ages * the all-Holy Spirit, who giveth life unto all. Blessed is the Tree whereby all the curse of delusion in Eden was annulled, which resulted from the wicked eating of the tree; and Christ the exceedingly glorious One hath been exalted, for in His tender compassion He willingly desired to be lifted up thereon. Once, the ever-glorious (Jacob), crossing his arms in a sacred manner, blessed his grandsons, revealing the form of the sacred Tree, whereby blessing hath been imparted unto all who were cursed by the malignant fruit of the tree and stumbled headlong into the abyss of evils. All mankind was set aright when Thou, O Master, wast stretched forth on the Cross. The horde of evil demons fell, and those who were scattered came together in unity; and the might of Thine authority and Thy power are exalted throughout all ages. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O divine spiritual athletes of the Lord, ye have inherited blessed glory, incorrupt sustenance and splendid habitations, having joined the ranks of heaven, ye have now received with gladness the fulfillment of your ever-glorious hopes. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Your courage shone forth more brightly than the sun, O radiant spiritual athletes of Christ, with divine power casting into darkness all the deception of the devil, and with pious wisdom enlightening the hearts of all the faithful throughout all ages. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O most pure Virgin, blessed Mother of Him Who created all things, all of us, the faithful, call thee the noetic cloud, the tabernacle of sanctity, the throne of God, the portal and lampstand of the Light, and the daybreak of the Word. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> In his wrath the Chaldean Tyrant made the furnace blaze, * with heat fanned sevenfold for the servants of God; * but when he perceived that they had been saved by a greater power * he cried aloud to the Creator and Redeemer; * ‘ye children bless, ye priests praise, * ye people, supremely exalt Him throughout all ages’. The Lord Almighty, Who dwelt in thy womb, showed thee to the faithful as a tower of confirmation; and fleeing to it we are delivered from perils and misfortunes, and are freed from temptation, chanting together: Ye priests hymn; ye people supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! Let the entreaty of my prayer rise unto the Lord Who issued forth from thy womb, O Lady, that He may deliver me from disobedience to His commandments, from condemnation and the curse of the law, that He may wash away the defilement of my grievous transgressions, in that He alone is merciful. O most pure Birthgiver of God, cleanse thou the wounds of my soul and my stumblings into sin, washing me clean with the streams which flowed from the side of thy Son; for to thee do I cry, to thee do I flee, and upon thee, who art full of the grace of God, do I call. We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the </p><p><i class="note">refrain:</i> “More honorable than the cherubim ...”<i class="note"> Prostrations.</i> </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Today the death that came to man through eating of the tree, * is made of no effect through the Cross. * For the curse of our Mother Eve * that fell on all mankind * is destroyed by the fruit of the pure Mother of God, * whom all the powers of heaven magnify. Exalting Thee most sacredly, O compassionate Master, we bow down before Thy Cross, the spear, the sponge, the reed, and the holy nails which pierced Thy hands and feet, whereby we have found perfect remission and have been deemed worthy to live in paradise. O how unjustly wast Thou condemned to be nailed, crucified, to the Tree, O Thou Who alone art the most just Judge of all, seeking to justify all who with faith glorify thy voluntary sufferings and dispensation, and who magnify Thee, O my Christ, with faith. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Giving their bodies over to tortures with all their soul, the glorious martyrs endured wounds and a violent death, the severing of their members, laceration, and burning by fire, and were aflame with love for the Lord; wherefore, crowned, they dwell in the heavens. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O Thou Who art the delight of the apostles and martyrs, By thy prayers fill us all with mercy, in that Thou art compassionate, granting us the remission of our sins, deliverance from all evils, and a place to dwell in Thy kingdom, O Thou Who for our sake appeared as a man. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O Virgin, thou wast shown to be a radiant bridal-chamber for Him Who made His abode within thine incorrupt womb, Who by His will endured His blessed passion, and in His ineffable mercy granted dispassion unto all. Worshipping Him with faith, we piously magnify thee. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Heaven was stricken with awe, * and the ends of the earth were filled with amazement, * for God hath appeared in the flesh, * and thy womb was rendered more spacious than the heavens. * Wherefore, the ranks of men and of angels * magnify thee as the Theotokos.  O thou who art truly the divine Mother of God, never cease to entreat Him Whom thou didst bear, that He grant now to thy servants remission of sins and perfect forgiveness to them for the evils they have committed; and that He grant them everlasting bliss with all the saints. O most holy Theotokos, gird about my lowly soul with the might and power of the Spirit, with weaponry and dominion, and arm it with the sword of the Cross. And cleanse the wounds of my sin with the dew of thy love for mankind and thy great mercy. Be unto me a pillar of salvation, O pure one; and render the hordes of the demons impotent, dispelling the turmoil of dangers and misfortunes, driving far away the assaults of the passions, and granting all of us pure liberation. O pure and most glorious Mother of God, save those who hymn thee with love, mercifully quelling the tumults of temptation; for as thou hast given birth unto God, O Virgin, thou art able to do whatsoever dost will, and freely grantest mercy. Wherefore, we all magnify thee.

        <h4>From the Menaion</h4>
        
          <p>With the conscience of a Martyr, as one who suffered in the ascetic life, thou hast 
presented thyself unto Christ through Martyrdom as an all-perfect living sacrifice.</p>
        
          <p>By thy sacred life, through thy divine words and with thy divine deeds didst thou 
make ascent in thy heart attaining to the true contemplation of God.</p>
        
          <p>In a divinely-wise manner didst thou direct thy words in accordance with the 
commandments of the Savior, wherefore thou wast revealed to be an invincible 
defender of the faith.</p>
        
          <p>Both a sacrifice and a priest, thou hast wholly given thyself unto God for the sake 
of the faith, and thus preserved undefiled the fulfillment of thy ministry unto Him.</p>
        
          <p>A spectacle seen as slain by the world, yet remaining alive in God, thou O godly-
spoken one, passed over to Christ enriched by the life of incorruption.</p>
        
          <p>Passing from earthly life into the never-waning glory, do thou, O holy one, by thy 
supplications fervently heal and cleanse my soul savaged by the passions.</p>

        <h3>THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS (13: 7-16)</h3><p>Brethren: Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto 
you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation. 
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. Be not carried about with 
divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with 
grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. 
We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. For 
the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high 
priest for sin, are burned without the camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that he might 
sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. Let us go forth 
therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. For here have we no 
continuing city, but we seek one to come. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of 
praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of (our) lips giving thanks to his name. But 
to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well 
pleased. 
</p><p><i class="note">Alleluia, In Tone II:</i> Thy priests shall be clothed with righteousness, and thy 
righteous shall rejoice. 
</p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> For the Lord hath elected Zion; He hath chosen Her to be a habitation 
for Himself.  
<h3>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE (12:2-12)</h3><p>The Lord said: There is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, 
that shall not be known. Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be 
heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be 
proclaimed upon the housetops. And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of 
them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will 
forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to 
cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. Are not five sparrows sold for two 
farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? But even the very hairs of 
your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many 
sparrows. Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the 
Son of man also confess before the angels of God: But he that denieth me before 
men shall be denied before the angels of God. And whosoever shall speak a word 
against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth 
against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven. And when they bring you unto the 
synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing 
ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same 
hour what ye ought to say.

<h3>Psalm 119</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN I was in trouble I called upon the Lord: and he heard me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitful tongue.
What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue: even mighty
and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.
Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech: and to have my
habitation among the tents of Kedar.
My soul hath long dwelt among them: that are enemies unto peace.
I labour for peace, but when I speak unto them thereof: they make them ready to
battle.
<h3>Psalm 120</h3>
A song of ascents
I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel: shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defence upon thy right hand.
So that the sun shall not burn thee by day: neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even he that shall keep thy
soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from this time forth for
evermore.
<h3>Psalm 121</h3>
A song of ascents
I WAS glad when they said unto me: We will go into the house of the Lord.
Our feet shall stand in thy gates: O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city: that is at unity in itself.
For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord: to testify unto Israel, to
give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.
For there is the seat of judgement: even the seat of the house of David.
O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
Peace be within thy walls: and plenteousness within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions' sakes: I will wish thee prosperity.
Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God: I will seek to do thee good.
<h3>Psalm 122</h3>
A song of ascents
UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as
the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even so our eyes wait
upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are utterly despised.
Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy: and with the
despitefulness of the proud.
<h3>Psalm 123</h3>
A song of ascents
IF THE Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say: if the Lord
himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;
They had swallowed us up quick: when thy were so wrathfully displeased at us.
Yea, the waters had drowned us: and the stream had gone over our soul.
The deep waters of the proud: had gone even over our soul.
But praised be the Lord: who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.
Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler: the snare is
broken, and we are delivered .
Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 124</h3>
A song of ascents
THEY that put their trust in the Lord shall be even as the mount Sion: which may
not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.
The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about his
people, from this time forth for evermore.
For the rod of the ungodly cometh not into the lot of the righteous: lest the
righteous put their hand unto wickedness.
Do well, O Lord: unto those that are good and true of heart.
As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness: the Lord shall lead them
forth with the evil-doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 125</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion: then were we like unto them
that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue with joy.
Then said they among the heathen: The Lord hath done great things for them.
Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already: whereof we rejoice.
Turn our captivity, O Lord: as the rivers in the south.
They that sow in tears: shall reap in joy.
He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed: shall
doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.
<h3>Psalm 126</h3>
A song of ascents
EXCEPT the Lord build the house: their labour is but lost that build it.
Except the Lord keep the city: the watchman waketh but in vain.
It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat
the bread of carefulness: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Lo, children and the fruit of the womb: are an heritage and gift that cometh of
the Lord.
Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant: even so are the young children.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed
when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
<h3>Psalm 127</h3>
A song of ascents
BLESSED are all they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: O well is thee, and happy shalt
thou be.
Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of thine house.
Thy children like the olive-branches: round about thy table.
Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the Lord.
The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shalt see Jerusalem in
prosperity all thy life long.
Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children: and peace upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 128</h3>
A song of ascents
MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up: may Israel now
say.
Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up: but they have not
prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed upon my back: and made long furrows.
But the righteous Lord: hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.
Let them be confounded and turned backward: as many as have evil will at Sion.
Let them be even as the grass growing upon the house-tops: which withereth
afore it be plucked up;
Whereof the mower filleth not his hand: neither he that bindeth up the sheaves
his bosom.
So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord prosper you: we wish you
good luck in the Name of the Lord.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 129</h3>
A song of ascents
OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.
O let thine ears consider well: the voice of my complaint.
If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss: O Lord, who may
abide it?
For there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared.
I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him: in his word is my trust.
My soul fleeth unto the Lord: before the morning watch, I say, before the
morning watch.
O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with him is
plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel: from all his sins.
<h3>Psalm 130</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, I am not high-minded: I have no proud looks.
I do not exercise myself in great matters: which are too high for me.
But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his
mother: yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.
O Israel, trust in the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 131</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, remember David: and all his trouble;
How he sware unto the Lord: and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God of Jacob;
I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house: nor climb up into my bed;
I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eye-lids to slumber: neither the
temples of my head to take any rest;
Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord: an habitation for the mighty
God of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of the same at Ephrata: and found it in the wood.
We will go into his tabernacle: and fall low on our knees before his footstool.
Arise, O Lord, into thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness: and let thy saints sing with
joyfulness.
For thy servant David's sake: turn not away the presence of thine Anointed.
The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David: and he shall not shrink from it;
Of the fruit of thy body: shall I set upon thy seat.
If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall learn them:
their children also shall sit upon thy seat for evermore.
For the Lord hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself: he hath longed for
her.
This shall be my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.
I will bless her victuals with increase: and will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will deck her priests with health: and her saints shall rejoice and sing.
There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: I have ordained a lantern for
mine Anointed.
As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame: but upon himself shall his
crown flourish.
<h3>Psalm 132</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is: brethren, to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down unto the beard:
even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts of his clothing.
Like as the dew of Hermon: which fell upon the hill of Sion.
For there the Lord promised his blessing: and life for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 133</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD now, praise the Lord: all ye servants of the Lord;
Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord: even in the courts of the house of
our God.
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary: and praise the Lord.
The Lord that made heaven and earth: give thee blessing out of Sion.

<h3>Psalm 109</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool.
The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: be thou ruler, even in the
midst among thine enemies.
In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free-will offerings with an holy
worship: the dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning.
The Lord sware, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech..
The Lord upon thy right hand: shall wound even kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places with the dead bodies:
and smite in sunder the heads over divers countries.
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up his head.
<h3>Psalm 110</h3>
Alleluia
I WILL give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart: secretly among the
faithful, and in the congregation.
The works of the Lord are great: sought out of all of them that have pleasure
therein.
His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour: and his righteousness
endureth for ever.
The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvellous works: that they
ought to be had in remembrance.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he shall ever be mindful of his
covenant.
He hath shewed his people the power of his works: that he may give them the
heritage of the heathen.
The works of his hands are verity and judgement: all his commandments are
true.
They stand fast for ever and ever: and are done in truth and equity.
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever;
holy and reverend is his Name.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all
they that do thereafter; the praise of it endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 111</h3>
Alleluia
BLESSED is the man that feareth the Lord: he hath great delight in his
commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall be
blessed.
Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth
for ever.
Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness: he is merciful, loving, and
righteous.
A good man is merciful, and lendeth: and will guide his words with discretion.
For he shall never be moved: and the righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance.
He will not be afraid of any evil tidings: for his heart standeth fast, and believeth
in the Lord.
His heart is established, and will not shrink: until he see his desire upon his
enemies.
He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor: and his righteousness
remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him: he shall gnash with his teeth,
and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.

<h3>Psalm 112</h3>
Alleluia
PRAISE the Lord, ye servants: O praise the Name of the Lord.
Blessed be the Name of the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
The Lord's Name is praised: from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of
the same.
The Lord is high above all heathen and his glory above the heavens.
Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling so high: and yet
humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?
He taketh up the simple out of the dust: and lifteth the poor out of the mire;
That he may set him with the princes: even with the princes of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house: and to be a joyful mother of
children.
<h3>Psalm 113</h3>
Alleluia
WHEN Israel came out of Egypt: and the house of Jacob from among the strange
people.
Judah was his sanctuary: and Israel his dominion.
The sea saw that, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams: and the little hills like young sheep.
What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest: and thou Jordan, that thou wast
driven back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams: and ye little hills, like young sheep?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the God of
Jacob.
Who turned the hard rock into a standing water: and the flint-stone into a
springing well.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise: for thy
loving mercy and for thy truth's sake.
Wherefore shall the heathen say: Where is now their God?
As for our God, he is in heaven: he hath done whatsoever pleased him.
Their idols are silver and gold: even the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not.
They have ears, and hear not: noses have they and smell not.
They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not: neither speak
they through their throat.
They that make them are like unto them ; and so are all such as put their trust in
them.
But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their succour and defence.
Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
Ye that fear the Lord, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
The Lord hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us: even he shall bless the
house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.
He shall bless them that fear the Lord: both small and great.
The Lord shall increase you more and more: you and your children.
Ye are the blessed of the Lord: who made heaven and earth.
All the whole heavens are the Lord's: the earth hath he given to the children of
men.
The dead praise not thee, O Lord: neither all they that go down into silence.
But we will praise the Lord: from this time forth for evermore. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 114</h3>
Alleluia
I AM well pleased: that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer.
That he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call upon him as long as I
live.
The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of hell gat hold
upon me.
I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I will call upon the Name of the Lord: O
Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea, our God is merciful
The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.
Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul: for the Lord hath rewarded thee.
And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from tears, and my
feet from falling.
I will walk before the Lord: in the land of the living.

<h3>Psalm 115</h3>
Alleluia
I BELIEVED, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled: I said in my
haste, All men are liars.
What reward shall I give unto the Lord: for all the benefits that he hath done
unto me?
I will receive the cup of salvation: and call upon the Name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: right dear in the sight of
the Lord is the death of his saints.
Behold, O Lord, how that I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thine
handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the Name of
the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of all his people: in the courts of
the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 116</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, all ye heathen: praise him, all ye nations.
For his merciful kindness is ever more and more towards us: and the truth of the
Lord endureth for ever. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 117</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: because his mercy endureth for
ever.
Let Israel now confess that he is gracious: and that his mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
Yea, let them now that fear the Lord confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
I called upon the Lord in trouble: and the Lord heard me at large.
The Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man doeth unto me.
The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire
upon mine enemies.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in man.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in princes.
All nations compassed me round about: but in the Name of the Lord will I destroy
them.
They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side: but in the
Name of the Lord will I destroy them.
They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire among the thorns:
for in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.
Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but the Lord was my help.
The Lord is my strength, and my song: and is become my salvation.
The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous: the right hand of
the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass.
The right hand of the Lord hath the pre-eminence: the right hand of the Lord
bringeth mighty things to pass.
I shall not die, but live: and declare the works of the Lord.
The Lord hath chastened and corrected me: but he hath not given me over unto
death.
Open me the gates of righteousness: that I may go into them, and give thanks
unto the Lord.
This is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into it.
I will thank thee, for thou hast heard me: and art become my salvation.
The same stone which the builders refused: is become the head-stone in the
corner.
This is the Lord's doing: and it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath made: we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Help me now, O Lord: O Lord, send us now prosperity.
Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: we have wished you good
luck , ye that are of the house of the Lord.
God is the Lord who hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, yea,
even unto the horns of the altar.
Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: thou art my God, and I will praise thee.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for ever.

Mine eyes prevent the night-watches: that I might be occupied in thy words.
Hear my voice, O Lord, according unto my loving-kindness: quicken me,
according as thou art wont.
Hear my voice, O Lord, according unto thy loving-kindness: quicken me,
according as thou art wont.
They draw nigh that of malice persecute me: and are far from thy law.
Be thou nigh at hand, O Lord: for all thy commandments are true.
As concerning thy testimonies, I have known long since: that thou hast grounded
them for ever.
O consider mine adversity, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.
Avenge thou my cause, and deliver me: quicken me, according to thy word.
Health is far from the ungodly: for they regard not thy statutes.
Great is thy mercy, O Lord: quicken me, as thou art wont.
Many there are that trouble me, and persecute me: yet do I not swerve from thy
testimonies.
It grieveth me when I see the transgressors: because they keep not thy law.
Consider, O Lord, how I love thy commandments: O quicken me, according to thy
loving-kindness.
Thy word is true from everlasting: all the judgements of thy righteousness
endure for evermore.
Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy
word.
I am as glad of thy word: as one that findeth great spoils.
As for lies, I hate and abhor them: but thy law do I love.
Seven times a day do I praise thee: because of thy righteous judgements.
Great is the peace that they have who love thy law: and they are not offended at
it.
Lord, I have looked for thy saving health: and done after thy commandments.
My soul hath kept thy testimonies: and loved them exceedingly.
I have kept thy commandments and testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.
Let my complaint come before thee, O Lord: give me understanding, according to
thy word.
Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me, according to thy word.
My lips shall speak of thy praise: when thou hast taught me thy statutes.
Yea, my tongue shall sing of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteous.
Let thine hand help me: for I have chosen thy commandments.
I have longed for thy saving health, O Lord: and in thy law is my delight.
O let my soul live, and it shall praise thee: and thy judgements shall help me.
I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost: O seek thy servant, for I do not forget
thy commandments.

Thou hast signed for us a royal reprieve, O Master; wherefore, we entreat Thee

life flow.

thee, is continuous, and where the radiance is eternal, and the voice of him who 
keepeth festival is sweet.

<h4>First Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 1</h3>
BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
stood in the way of sinners: and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful.
But his delight is in the law of the Lord: and in his law will he exercise himself
day and night.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side: that will bring forth his
fruit in due season.
His leaf also shall not wither: and look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper.
As for the ungodly, it is not so with them: but they are like the chaff, which the
wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.
Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment: neither the
sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
But the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: and the way of the ungodly shall
perish.
<h3>Psalm 2</h3>
WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why do the people imagine a
vain thing?
The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together: against the
Lord, and against his Anointed.
Let us break their bonds asunder: and cast away their cords from us.
He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: the Lord shall have them
in derision.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath: and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Yet I have set my King: upon my holy hill of Sion.
I will preach the law, whereof the Lord hath said unto me: Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee.
Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance: and the
utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron: and break them in pieces like a
potter's vessel.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be learned, ye that are judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord in fear: and rejoice unto him with reverence.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way: if his wrath
be kindled, (yea, but a little,) blessed are all they that put their trust in
him.
<h3>Psalm 3</h3>
A psalm of David. When he fled from the presence of his son Absalom
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me: many are they that rise against
me.
Many one there be that say of my soul: There is no help for him in his God.
But thou, O Lord, art my defender: thou art my worship, and the lifter up of my
head.
I did call upon the Lord with my voice: and he heard me out of his holy hill.
I laid me down and slept, and rose up again: for the Lord sustained me.
I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people: that have set themselves
against me round about.
Up, Lord, and help me, O my God: for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the
cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.
    </div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 4</h3>
For the end. A song of David among the Psalms
HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast set me at liberty
when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour: and have such
pleasure in vanity, and seek after leasing?
Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that is godly: when
I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart, and in your chamber,
and be still.
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness: and put your trust in the Lord.
There be many that say: Who will shew us any good?
Lord, lift thou up: the light of thy countenance upon us.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart: since the time that their corn and wine and
oil increased.
I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest: for it is thou, Lord, only, that
makest me dwell in safety.
<h3>Psalm 5</h3>
For the end. A song of David concerning her that inherits
PONDER my words, O Lord: consider my meditation
O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King, and my God: for unto thee
will I make my prayer.
My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O Lord: early in the morning will I direct my
prayer unto thee, and will look up.
For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness: neither shall any devil
dwell with thee.
Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest all of them that
work vanity.
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor both the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude of thy
mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies: make thy way
plain before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in his mouth: their inward parts are very wickedness.
Their throat is an open sepulchre: they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own imaginations: cast
them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebelled
against thee.
And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: they shall ever be giving of
thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be
joyful in thee;
For thou, Lord, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous: and with thy favourable
kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
<h3>Psalm 6</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns for the eighth
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy
displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones are
vexed.
My soul also is sore troubled: but, Lord, how long wilt thou punish me?
Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's sake.
For in death no man remembereth thee: and who will give thee thanks in the pit?
I am weary of my groaning; every night wash I my bed: and water my couch with
my tears.
My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of all mine enemies.
Away from me, all ye that work vanity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my
weeping.
The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer.
All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed: they shall be turned back,
and put to shame suddenly.
    </div>
      
        <div>
<h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 7</h3>
A psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the Benjamite
O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all them that
persecute me, and deliver me;
Lest he devour my soul, like a lion, and tear it in pieces: while there is none to
help.
O Lord my God, if I have done any such thing: or if there be any wickedness in
my hands;
If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me: yea, I have delivered
him that without any cause is mine enemy,
Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me: yea, let him tread my life
down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.
Stand up, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignation of
mine enemies: arise up for me in the judgement that thou hast
commanded.
And so shall the congregation of the people come about thee: for their sakes
therefore lift up thyself again.
The Lord shall judge the people; give sentence with me, O Lord: according to my
righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in me.
O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end: but guide thou the just.
For the righteous God: trieth the very hearts and reins.
My help cometh of God: who preserveth them that are true of heart.
God is a righteous Judge, strong and patient: and God is provoked every day.
If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword: he hath bent his bow, and made it
ready.
He hath prepared for him the instruments of death: he ordaineth his arrows
against the persecutors
Behold, he travaileth with mischief: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth
ungodliness.
He hath graven and digged up a pit: and is fallen on himself into the destruction
that he made for other.
For his travail shall come upon his own head: and his wickedness shall fall on his
own pate.
I will give thanks unto the Lord, according to his righteousness: and I will praise
the Name of the Lord most High.
<h3>Psalm 8</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the winepresses
O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world: thou hast set
thy glory above the heavens!
Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength,
because of thine enemies: that thou mightest still the enemy and the
avenger.
For I will consider thy heavens, even the works of thy fingers: the moon and the
stars, which thou hast ordained.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him: and the son of man, that thou visitest
him?
Thou madest him lower than the angels: to crown him with glory and worship.
Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands: and thou hast put
all things in subjection under his feet;
All sheep and oxen: yea, and the beasts of the field;
The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and whatsoever walketh through
the paths of the seas.
O Lord our Governor: how excellent is thy Name in all the world!

          <div><h3>Ode IV</h3><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Of old, Habbakuk heard wondrous report of Thee O Christ, * and cried aloud in fear: * God shall come forth from Theman, * the Holy One from the mountain overshadowed and densely wooded, * to save His anointed ones! * Glory to Thy power, O Lord!  </p><p>Thee, O Mother of God, hath the ruler of the world described beforehand as comely and all-honored among women, as coming up from the wilderness, and bearing Christ, thine Off­spring, in thine arms; and he cried: Glory to Thy power, O Lord! </p><p>Incline thine ear unto me, O good one, behold mine oppression and the increase of my tribulations!

<h3>Psalm9</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the secrets of the Son
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will speak of all thy
marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O thou
most Highest.
While mine enemies are driven back: they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in the throne that
judgest right.
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly: thou hast put out
their name for ever and ever.
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: even as the cities which
thou hast destroyed, their memorial is perished with them.
But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath also prepared his seat for judgement.
For he shall judge the world in righteousness: and minister true judgement unto
the people.
The Lord also will be a defence for the oppressed: even a refuge in due time of
trouble.
And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast
never failed them that seek thee.
O praise the Lord which dwelleth in Sion: show the people of his doings.
For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them :and forgetteth
not the complaint of the poor.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider the trouble which I suffer of them that
hate me: thou that liftest me up from the gates of death.
That I may shew all thy praises within the ports of the daughter of Sion: I will
rejoice in thy salvation.
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the same net which they
hid privily, is their foot taken.
The Lord is known to execute judgement: the ungodly is trapped in the work of
his own hands.
The wicked shall be turned into hell: and all the people that forget God.
For the poor shall not always be forgotten: the patient abiding of the meek shall
not perish for ever.
Up, Lord, and let not man have the upper hand: let the heathen be judged in thy
sight.
Put them in fear, O Lord: that the heathen may know themselves to be but men.
Why standest thou so far off, O Lord: and hidest thy face in the needful time of
trouble?
The ungodly for his own lust doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the
crafty wiliness that they have imagined.
For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire: and speaketh good of
the covetous, whom God abhorreth.
The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God ; neither is God in all his
thoughts.
His ways are always grievous: thy judgments are far above out of his sight, and
therefore defieth he all his enemies.
For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down: there shall no
harm happen unto me.
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is ungodliness
and vanity.
He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets: and privily in his lurking
dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.
For he lieth waiting secretly, even as a lion lurketh he in his den: that he may
ravish the poor.
He doth ravish the poor: when he getteth him into his net.
He falleth down, and humbleth himself: that the congregation of the poor may
fall into the hands of his captains.
He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face, and
he will never see it.
Arise, O Lord God, and lift up thine hand: forget not the poor.
Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God: while he doth say in his heart,
Tush, thou God carest not for it.
Surely thou hast seen it: for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong.
That thou mayest take the matter into thy hand: the poor committeth himself
unto thee; for thou art the helper of the friendless.
Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious: take away his ungodliness,
and thou shalt find none.
The Lord is King for ever and ever: and the heathen are perished out of the land.
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the poor: thou preparest their heart, and
thine ear hearkeneth thereto;
To help the fatherless and poor unto their right: that the man of the earth be no
more exalted against them.
<h3>Psalm10</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
IN THE Lord put I my trust: how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a
bird unto the hill?
For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the
quiver: that they may privily shoot at them which are true of heart.
For the foundations will be cast down: and what have the righteous done?
The Lord is in his holy temple: the Lord's seat is in heaven.
His eyes consider the poor: and his eye-lids try the children of men.
The Lord alloweth the righteous: but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in
wickedness, doth his soul abhor.
Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest:
this shall be their portion to drink.
For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness: his countenance will behold the
thing that is just
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm11</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, upon the eighth
HELP me, Lord, for there is not one godly man left: for the faithful are minished
from among the children of men,
They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour: they do but flatter with their
lips, and dissemble in their double heart.
The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips: and the tongue that speaketh proud
things;
Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail: we are they that ought to
speak , who is lord over us?
Now for the comfortless trouble's sake of the needy: and because of the deep
sighing of the poor,
I will up, saith the Lord: and will help every one from him that swelleth against
him, and will set him at rest.
The words of the Lord are pure words: even as the silver, which from the earth is
tried, and purified seven times in the fire.
Thou shalt keep them, O Lord: thou shalt preserve him from this generation for
ever.
The ungodly walk on every side: when they are exalted, the children of men are
put to rebuke.
<h3>Psalm12</h3>
For the end, psalm of David
HOW long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever: how long wilt thou hide thy face
from me?
How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart: how long
shall mine enemies triumph over me?
Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in
death.
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: for if I be cast down, they
that trouble me will rejoice at it.
But my trust is in thy mercy: and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.
I will sing of the Lord, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me: yea, I will
praise the Name of the Lord most Highest.
<h3>Psalm13</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE fool hath said in his heart: There is no God.
They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings: there is none that
doeth good, no not one.
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there
were any that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is none that doeth good, no not one.
Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have they deceived: the
poison of asps is under their lips.
Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood.
Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they not
known ; there is no fear of God before their eyes.
Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief: eating up my
people as it were bread, and call not upon the Lord?
There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was: for God is in the
generation of the righteous.
As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor: because he putteth
his trust in the Lord.
Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turneth the
captivity of his people: then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm14</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle: or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?
Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life: and doeth the thing which is right, and
speaketh the truth from his heart.
He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour: and
hath not slandered his neighbour.
He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes: and maketh much of
them that fear the Lord.
He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not: thou it were to
his own hindrance.
He that hath not given his money upon usury: nor taken reward against the
innocent.
Whoso doeth these things: shall never fall.
<h3>Psalm15</h3>
A writing of David
PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee have I put my trust.
O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, my goods are nothing
unto thee.
All my delight is upon the saints, that are in the earth: and upon such as excel in
virtue.
But they that run after another god: shall have great trouble.
Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer: neither make mention of their
names within my lips.
The Lord himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou shalt
maintain my lot.
The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will thank the Lord for giving me warning: my reins also chasten me in the
night-season.
I have set God always before me: for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not
fall.
Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiced: my flesh also shall rest in
hope.
For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell: neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy
One to see corruption.
Thou shalt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is the fulness of joy: and at
thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.
<h3>Psalm16</h3>
A prayer of David
HEAR the right, O Lord, consider my complaint: and hearken unto my prayer,
that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence: and let thine eyes look upon the
thing that is equal.
Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night-season; thou hast tried me,
and shalt find no wickedness in me; for I am utterly purposed that my
mouth shall not offend.
Because of men's works, that are done against the words of thy lips: I have kept
me from the ways of the destroyer.
O hold thou up my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps slip not.
I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: incline thine ear to me,
and hearken unto my words.
Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which
put their trust in thee: from such as resist thy right hand.
Keep me as the apple of an eye: hide me under the shadow of thy wings.
From the ungodly that trouble me: mine enemies compass me round about to
take away my soul.
They are enclosed in their own fat: and their mouth speaketh proud things.
They lie waiting in our way on every side: turning their eyes down to the ground.
Like of a lion that is greedy of his prey: and as it were a lion's whelp. lurking in
secret places.
Up, Lord, disappoint him, and cast him down: deliver my soul from the ungodly,
which is a sword of thine;
From the men of thy hand, O Lord, from the men, I say, and from the evil world:
which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid
treasure.
They have children at their desire: and leave the rest of their substance for their
babes.
But as for me, I will behold thy presence in righteousness: and when I awake up
after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied with it.</div>

<h3>Psalm 17</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David the servant of the Lord. The words which he spoke to the Lord,
even the words of this song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his
enemies, and out of the hand of Saul. And he said:
I WILL love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony rock, and my
defence: my saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust, my
buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.
I will call upon the Lord, which is worthy to be praised: so shall I be safe from
mine enemies.
The sorrows of death compassed me: and the overflowings of ungodliness made
me afraid.
The pains of hell came about me: the snares of death overtook me.
In my trouble I will call upon the Lord: and complain unto my God.
So shall he hear my voice out of his holy temple: and my complaint shall come
before him, it shall enter even into his ears.
The earth trembled and quaked: the very foundations also of the hills shook, and
were removed, because he was wroth.
There went a smoke out in his presence: and a consuming fire out of his mouth,
so that coals were kindled at it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and it was dark under his feet.
He rode upon the cherubim, and did fly: he came flying upon the wings of the
wind.
He made darkness his secret place: his pavilion round about him, with dark
water and thick clouds to cover him.
At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed: hail-stones and coals of
fire.
The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hailstones and coals of fire.
He sent out his arrows, and scattered them: he cast forth lightnings, and
destroyed them.
The springs of water were seen, and the foundations of the round world were
discovered, at thy chiding, O Lord: at the blasting of the breath of thy
displeasure.
He shall send down from on high to fetch me: and shall take me out of many
waters.
He shall deliver from me my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me: for
they are too mighty for me.
They prevented me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my upholder.
He brought me forth also into a place of liberty: he brought me forth even
because he had a favour unto me.
The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing: according to the cleanness
of my hands shall he recompense me.
Because I have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not forsaken my God, as the
wicked doth.
For I have an eye unto all his laws: and will not cast out his commandments from
me.
I was also uncorrupt before him: and eschewed mine own wickedness.
Therefore shall the Lord reward me after my righteous dealing: and according
unto the cleanness of my hands in his eye-sight.
With the holy thou shalt be holy: and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.
With the clean thou shalt be clean: and with the froward thou shalt learn
frowardness.
For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity: and shalt bring down the
high looks of the proud.
Thou also shalt light my candle: the Lord my God shall make my darkness to be
light.
For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men: and with the help of my God I shall
leap over the wall.
The way of God is an undefiled way: the word of the Lord also is tried in the fire;
he is the defender of all them that put their trust in him.
For who is God, but the Lord: or who hath any strength, except our God?
It is God, that girdeth me with strength of war: and maketh my way perfect.
He maketh my feet like harts' feet: and setteth me up on high.
He teacheth mine hands to fight: and mine arms shall break even a bow of steel.
Thou hast given me the defence of my salvation: thy right hand also shall hold
me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.
Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go: that my footsteps shall not
slide.
I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them: neither will I turn again till I
have destroyed them.
I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand: but fall under my feet.
Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou shalt throw done mine
enemies under me.
Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me: and I shall
destroy them that hate me.
They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them: yea, even unto the Lord
shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.
I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I will cast them out as the
clay in the streets.
Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people: and thou shalt make me
the head of the heathen.
A people whom I have not known: shall serve me.
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: but the strange children shall
dissemble with me.
The strange children shall fail: and be afraid out of their prisons.
The Lord liveth, and blessed be my strong helper: and praised be the Lord of my
salvation.
Even the God that seeth that I be avenged: and subdueth the people unto me.
It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine
adversaries: thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.
For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles: and sing
praises unto thy Name.
Great prosperity giveth he unto his King: and showeth loving-kindness unto
David his Anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.

<h3>Psalm 18</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament showeth his
handiwork.
One day telleth another: and one night certifieth another.
There is neither speech nor language: but their voices are heard among them.
Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words into the ends of the world.
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun: which cometh forth as a
bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.
It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the
end of it again: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, converting the soul: the testimony of the
Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: the commandment of
the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever: the judgments of the Lord
are true, and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also
than honey, and the honey-comb.
Moreover, by them is thy servant taught: and in keeping of them there is great
reward.
Who can tell how oft he offendeth: O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.
Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion over
me: so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart: be alway
acceptable in thy sight,
O Lord: my strength, and my redeemer.
<h3>Psalm 19</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the Name of the God of Jacob defend
thee;
Send thee help from the sanctuary: and strengthen thee out of Sion;
Remember all thy offerings: and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
Grant thee thy heart's desire: and fulfil all thy mind.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God:
the Lord perform all thy petitions.
Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Anointed, and will hear him from his holy
heaven: even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.
Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the
Name of the Lord our God.
They are brought down, and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, Lord and hear us, O King of heaven: when we call upon thee.
<h3>Psalm 20</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be of thy
salvation.
Thou hast given him his heart's desire: and hast not denied him the request of
his lips.
For thou shalt prevent him with the blessings of goodness: and shalt set a crown
of pure gold upon his head.
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life: even for ever and ever.
His honour is great in thy salvation: glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon
him.
For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity: and make him glad with the joy of thy
countenance.
And why? because the King putteth his trust in the Lord: and in the mercy of the
most Highest he shall not miscarry.
All thine enemies shall feel thine hand: thy right hand shall find out them that
hate thee.
Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: the Lord shall
destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.
Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth: and their seed from among the
children of men.
For they intended mischief against thee: and imagined such a device as they are
not able to perform.
Therefore shalt thou put them to flight: and the strings of thy bow shalt thou
make ready against the face of them.
Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so we will sing, and praise thy
power.

<h3>Psalm 21</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the morning aid.
MY GOD, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me: and art so far from
my health, and from the words of my complaint?
O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not: and in the night-season
also I take no rest.
And thou continuest holy: O thou worship of Israel.
Our fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them.
They called upon thee, and were holpen: they put their trust in thee, and were
not confounded.
But as for me, I am a worm, and no man: a very scorn of men, and the outcast of
the people.
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot our their lips, and shake their
heads, saying,
He trusted in God, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, if he will have
him.
But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: thou wast my hope, when
I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.
I have been left unto thee ever since I was born: thou art my God, even from my
mother's womb.
O go not from me, for trouble is hard at hand: and there is none to help me.
Many oxen are come about me: fat bulls of Basan close me in on every side.
They gape upon me with their mouths: as it were a ramping and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart also in the
midst of my body is even like melting wax.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my gums: and
thou shalt bring me into the dust of death.
For many dogs are come about me: and the council of the wicked layeth siege
against me.
They pierced my hands and my feet; I may tell all my bones: they stand staring
and looking upon me.
They part my garments among them: and casts lots upon my vesture.
But be not thou far from me, O Lord: thou art my succour, haste thee to help me.
Deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth: thou hast heard me also from among the horns of
the unicorns.
I will declare thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I
praise thee.
O praise the Lord, ye that fear him: magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob, and
fear him, all ye seed of Israel.
For he hath not despised, nor abhorred, the low estate of the poor: he hath not
hid his face from him, but when he called unto him he heard him.
My praise is of thee in the great congregation: my vows will I perform in the
sight of them that fear him.
The poor shall eat and be satisfied: they that seek after the Lord shall praise him;
your heart shall live for ever.
All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned unto the
Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him.
For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the Governor among the people.
All such as be fat upon earth: have eaten and worshipped.
All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him: and no man hath
quickened his own soul.
My seed shall serve him: they shall be counted unto the Lord for a generation.
They shall come, and the heavens shall declare his righteousness: unto a people
that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.
<h3>Psalm 22</h3>
A psalm of David
THE Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside the waters of
comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness, for
his Name's sake.
Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort me.
Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble me: thou hast
anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.
But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
<h3>Psalm 23</h3>
A psalm of David on the first day of the week
THE earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and
they that dwell therein.
For he hath founded it upon the seas: and prepared it upon the floods.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall rise up in his holy place?
Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart: and that hath not lift up his
mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord: and righteousness from the God of
his salvation.
This is the generation of them that seek him: even of them that seek thy face, O
Jacob.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: it is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty
in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: even the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.

        </p><h3>THE READING FROM THE BOOK OF PROVERBS (3, 13-16; 8, 6) </h3><p>The memory of the just is praised, and the blessing of the Lord is upon his head.  Blessed is the man who hath found wisdom, and the mortal who knoweth prudence.  For it is better to traffic for her, than for treasures of gold and silver. And she is more  valuable than precious stones: no precious thing is equal to her in value. For length of  existence and years of life are in her right hand; and in her left hand are wealth and  glory: out of her mouth righteousness proceedeth, and she carrieth law and mercy  upon her tongue. Hearken to me, O children, for I will speak solemn truths. Blessed  is the man who shall keep my ways; for my outgoings are the outgoings of life, and in  them is prepared favor from the Lord. Ye, O men, do I exhort; and utter my voice to  the sons of men. I, wisdom, have built up; upon counsel, knowledge and  understanding have I called. Counsel and safety are mine; prudence is mine, and  strength is mine. I love those that love me; they that seek me shall find grace. O ye  simple, understand subtlety, and ye that are untaught, imbibe knowledge. Hearken  unto me again; for I will speak solemn truths. For my throat shall meditate truth; and  false lips are an abomination before me. All the words of my mouth are in  righteousness; there is nothing in them wrong or perverse. They are all evident to  those that understand, and right to those that find knowledge. For I will instruct you  in truth, that your hope may be in the Lord, and ye may be filled with the Spirit.  </p><h3>THE READING FROM THE BOOK OF PROVERBS (10, 31-32 ; 11, 1-10). </h3><p>The mouth of the righteous droppeth wisdom: but the tongue of the unjust shall  perish. The lips of just men drop grace: but the mouth of the ungodly is perverse.  False balances are an abomination before the Lord: but a just weight is acceptable  unto Him. Wherever pride entereth, there will also disgrace: but the mouth of the  humble doth meditate wisdom. The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the  overthrow of the rebellious shall spoil them. Possessions shall not profit in the day of  wrath, but righteousness will deliver from death. When a just man dieth, he leaveth  regret: but the destruction of the ungodly is speedy and causeth joy. Righteousness  traceth out blameless paths: but ungodliness encountereth unjust dealing. The  righteousness of upright men delivereth them: but transgressors are caught in their  own destruction. At the death of a just man his hope doth not perish: but the boast  of the ungodly perisheth. A righteous man escapeth from a snare, and the ungodly  man is delivered up in his place. In the mouth of ungodly men is a snare for citizens:  but the understanding of righteous men is prosperous. In the prosperity of righteous  men a city prospereth, but at the destruction of the wicked there is exultation. At the  blessing of the upright a city shall be exalted, but by the mouths of ungodly men it is  overthrown. A man void of understanding sneereth at his fellow citizens: but a  sensible man is quiet. </p><h3>THE READING FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON (4, 7-15.) </h3><p>Though the righteous man happen to die, yet shall he rest in peace. For honorable  age is not that which is so for a length of time, nor that which is measured by the  number of years. But wisdom and a spotless life to a ripe old age is the true gray hair  of a man. He pleased God, and was beloved of Him, so that living among sinners he  was taken away. Yea, speedily was he taken up, lest wickedness should pervert his  understanding, or deceit beguile his soul. For the beguilement of transgression doth  obscure things that are good, and the wanderings of lust doth undermine the  innocent mind. Made perfect in a short time, he fulfilled many years; for his soul  pleased the Lord; therefore the Lord hastened to take him away from among the  wicked. This the people saw, and did not understand, neither did they lay this up in  their hearts, that grace and mercy is with His saints, and that the Lord doth visit His  chosen ones.

<h3>Psalm 24</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my trust in thee: O
let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.
For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed: but such as transgress
without a cause shall be put to confusion.
Shew me thy ways, O Lord: and teach me thy paths.
Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God of my salvation; in
thee hath been my hope all the day long.
Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender mercies: and thy loving-kindnesses,
which have been ever of old.
O remember not the sins and offences of my youth: but according to thy mercy
think thou upon me, O Lord, for thy goodness.
Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Them that are meek shall he guide in judgement: and such as are gentle, them
shall he learn his way.
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth: unto such as keep his covenant
and his testimonies.
For thy Name's sake, O Lord: be merciful unto my sin, for it is great.
What man is he that feareth the Lord: him shall he teach in the way that he shall
choose.
His soul shall dwell at ease: and his seed shall inherit the land.
The secret of the Lord is among them that fear him: and he will show them his
covenant.
Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out of the
net.
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am desolate and in misery.
The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my troubles.
Look upon my adversity and misery: and forgive me all my sin.
Consider mine enemies, how many they are: and they bear a tyrannous hate
against me.
O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be confounded, for I have put my
trust in thee.
Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me: for my hope hath been in
thee.
Deliver Israel, O God: out of all his troubles.
<h3>Psalm 25</h3>
A psalm of David
BE THOU my judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently: my trust hath been
also in the Lord, therefore shall I not fall.
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me: try out my reins and my heart.
For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes: and I will walk in thy truth.
I have not dwelt with vain persons: neither will I have fellowship with the
deceitful.
I have hated the congregation of the wicked: and will not sit among the ungodly.
I will wash my hands in innocency, O Lord: and so will I go to thine altar.
That I may show the voice of thanksgiving: and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house: and the place where thine honour
dwelleth.
O shut not up my soul with the sinners: nor my life with the blood-thirsty.
In whose hands is wickedness: and their right hand is full of gifts.
But as for me, I will walk innocently: O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.
My foot standeth right: I will praise the Lord in the congregations.
<h3>Psalm 26</h3>
A psalm of David before he was anointed
THE Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom then shall I fear: the Lord is the
strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my
flesh: they stumbled and fell.
Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid:
and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.
One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may dwell
in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of
the Lord, and to visit his temple.
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle: yea, in the secret
place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone.
And now shall he lift up mine head: above mine enemies round about me.
Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness: I will sing,
and speak praises unto the Lord.
Hearken unto my voice, O Lord, when I cry unto thee: have mercy upon me, and
hear me.
My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: Thy face, Lord, will I seek.
O hide not thou thy face from me: nor cast thy servant away in displeasure.
Thou hast been my succour: leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me: the Lord taketh me up.
Teach me the way, O Lord: and lead in the right way, because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: for there are false
witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.
I should utterly have fainted: but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the
Lord in the land of the living.
O tarry thou the Lord's leisure: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart ; and
put thou thy trust in the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 27</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee will I cry, O Lord my strength: think no scorn of me; lest, if thou
make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go down into the
pit.
Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee: when I hold up my
hands towards the mercy-seat of thy holy temple.
O pluck me not away, neither destroy me, with the ungodly and wicked doers:
which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mischief in their
hearts.
Reward them according to their deeds: and according to the wickedness of their
own inventions.
Recompense them after the work of their hands: pay them that they have
deserved.
For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his
hands: therefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.
Praised be the Lord: for he hath heard the voice of my humble petitions.
The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and I am
helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise
him.
The Lord is my strength: and he is the wholesome defence of his Anointed.
O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: feed them , and
set them up for ever.
<h3>Psalm 28</h3>
A psalm of David on the occasion of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle
BRING unto the Lord, O ye mighty, bring young rams unto the Lord: ascribe unto
the Lord worship and strength.
Give the Lord the honour due unto his Name: worship the Lord with holy
worship.
It is the Lord that commandeth the waters: it is the glorious God that maketh the
thunder.
It is the Lord that ruleth the sea; the voice of the Lord is mighty in operation: the
voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar-trees: yea, the Lord breaketh the
cedars of Libanus.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf: Libanus also, and Sirion, like a young
unicorn.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the Lord shaketh
the wilderness: yea, the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Cades.
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and discovereth the
thick bushes: in his temple doth every man speak of his honour.
The Lord sitteth above the water -flood: and the Lord remaineth a King for ever.
The Lord shall give strength unto his people: the Lord shall give his people the
blessing of peace.
<h3>Psalm 29</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song at the dedication of the house of David
I WILL magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up: and not made my foes to
triumph over me.
O Lord my God, I cried unto thee: and thou hast healed me.
Thou, Lord, hast brought my soul out of hell: thou hast kept my life from them
that go down to the pit.
Sing praises unto the Lord, O ye saints of his: and give thanks unto him for a
remembrance of his holiness.
For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his pleasure is life:
heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: thou, Lord, of thy
goodness hast made my hill so strong.
Thou didst turn thy face from me: and I was troubled.
Then cried I unto thee, O Lord: and gat me to my Lord right humbly.
What profit is there in my blood: when I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust give thanks unto thee: or shall it declare thy truth?
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.
Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and
girded me with gladness.
Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing: O my God, I
will give thanks unto thee for ever.

<h3>Psalm 30</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David; an utterance of extreme fear
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion, deliver
me in thy righteousness.
Bow down thine ear to me: make haste to deliver me.
And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence: that thou mayest save me.
For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: be thou also my guide, and lead me
for thy Name's sake.
Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my
strength.
Into thy hands I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou
God of truth.
I have hated them that hold of superstitious vanities: and my trust hath been in
the Lord.
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble, and
hast known my soul in adversities.
Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: but hast set my feet in a
large room.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord , for I am in trouble: and mine eye is consumed for
very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.
For my life is waxen old with heaviness: and my years with mourning.
My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity: and my bones are consumed.
I became a reproof among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours: and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me; and they
that did see me without conveyed themselves from me.
I am clean forgotten, as a dead man out of mind: I am become like a broken
vessel.
For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude: and fear is on every side, while
they conspire together against me, and take their counsel to take away my
life.
But my hope hath been in thee, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my God.
My time is in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies: and from
them that persecute me.
Shew thy servant the light of thy countenance: and save me for thy mercy's sake.
Let me not be confounded, O Lord for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be
put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.
Let the lying lips be put to silence: which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully,
speak against the righteous.
O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee:
and that thou hast prepared for them that put their trust in thee, even
before the sons of men!
Thou shalt hide them privily by thine own presence from the provoking of all
men: thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle from the strife of
tongues.
Thanks be to the Lord: for he hath shewed me marvellous great kindness in a
strong city.
And when I made haste, I said: I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.
Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer: when I cried unto thee.
26.O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth them that are
faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.
Be strong, and he shall establish your heart: all that ye put your trust in the
Lord.
<h3>Psalm 31</h3>
A psalm of instruction by David
BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven: and whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no sin: and in whose spirit
there is no guile.
For while I held my tongue: my bones consumed away through my daily
complaining.
For thy hand is heavy upon me day and night: and my moisture is like the
drought in summer.
I will acknowledge my sin unto thee: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.
I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord: and so thou forgavest the wickedness
of my sin.
For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a time when
thou mayest be found: but in the great water-floods they shall not come
nigh him.
Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shalt preserve me from trouble: thou shalt
compass me about with songs of deliverance.
I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go: and I will
guide thee with mine eyes.
Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding: whose mouths
must be held with bit and bridle. lest they fall upon thee.
Great plagues remain for the ungodly: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord,
mercy embraceth him on every side.
Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord: and be joyful, all ye that are true
of heart.

<h3>Psalm 32</h3>
A psalm of David
REJOICE in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to be thankful.
Praise the Lord with harp: sing praises unto him with the lute, and instrument of
ten strings.
Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing praises lustily unto him with a good
courage.
For the word of the Lord is true: and all his works are faithful.
He loveth righteousness and judgement: the earth is full of the goodness of the
Lord.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the hosts of them by the
breath of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap: and layeth
up the deep, as in a treasure-house.
Let all the earth fear the Lord: stand in awe of him, all ye that dwell in the world.
For he spake, and it was done: he commanded and it stood fast.
The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: and maketh the devices
of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the counsels of princes.
The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever: and the thoughts of his heart from
generation to generation.
Blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord Jehovah: and blessed are the folk,
that he hath chosen to him to be his inheritance.
The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the children of men: from the
habitation of his dwelling he considereth all them that dwell on the earth.
He fashioneth all the hearts of them: and understandeth all their works.
There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host: neither is any
mighty man delivered by much strength.
A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man: neither shall he deliver any
man by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him: and upon them that put
their trust in his mercy.
To deliver their soul from death: and to feed them in the time of dearth.
Our soul hath patiently tarried for the Lord: for he is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in him: because we have hoped in his holy Name.
Let thy merciful kindness, O Lord, be upon us: like as we do put our trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 33</h3>
A psalm of David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech, and he was dismissed
and departed
I WILL alway give thanks unto the Lord: his praise shall ever be in my mouth.
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be
glad.
O praise the Lord with me: and let us magnify his Name together.
I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he delivered me out of all my fear.
They had an eye unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
ashamed.
Lo, the poor crieth, and the Lord heareth him: yea, and saveth him out of all his
troubles.
The angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him: and delivereth
them.
O taste, and see, how gracious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusteth in
him.
O fear the Lord, ye that are his saints: for they that fear him lack nothing.
The lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they who seek the Lord shall want no
manner of thing that is good.
Come, ye children, and hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
What man is he that lusteth to live: and would fain see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil: and thy lips, that they speak no guile.
Eschew evil, and do good: seek peace, and ensue it.
The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous: and his ears are open unto their
prayers.
The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil: to root out the
remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them: and delivereth them out of all
their troubles.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and will save such as be
of an humble spirit.
Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of all.
He keepeth all his bones: so that not one of them is broken.
But misfortune shall slay the ungodly: and they that hate the righteous shall be
desolate.
The Lord delivereth the souls of his servants: and all they that put their trust in
him shall not be destitute.

<h3>Psalm 34</h3>
A psalm of David
PLEAD thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: and fight thou
against them that fight against me.
Lay hand upon the shield and buckler: and stand up to help me.
Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto
my soul, I am thy salvation.
Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seek after my soul :let them be
turned back and brought to confusion, that imagine mischief for me.
Let them be as the dust before the wind: and the angel of the Lord scattering
them.
Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord persecute them.
For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause: yea, even
without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.
Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net, that he hath laid
privily, catch himself: that he may fall into his own mischief.
And, my soul, be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, who deliverest the poor from
him that is too strong for him: yea, the poor, and him that is in misery, from
him that spoileth him?
False witnesses did rise up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
They rewarded me evil for good: to the great discomfort of my soul.
Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with
fasting.: and my prayer shall turn into mine own bosom.
I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother: I went heavily,
as one that mourneth for his mother.
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the
very abjects came together against me unawares, making mouths at me,
and ceased not.
With the flatterers were busy mockers: who gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, how long wilt though look upon this: O deliver my soul from the calamities
which they bring on me, and my darling from the lions.
So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among
much people.
O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly: neither let them
wink with their eyes that they hate me without a cause.
And why? their communing is not for peace; but they imagine deceitful words
against them that are quiet in the land.
They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said: Fie on thee, fie on thee, we
saw it with our eyes.
This thou hast seen, O Lord: hold not thy tongue then, go not far from me, O
Lord.
Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel: avenge thou my cause, my God, and
my Lord.
Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness: and let them not
triumph over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, There, there, so would we have it: neither let
them say, We have devoured him.
Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at my trouble: let
them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that boast themselves against
me.
Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing: yea, let them say
alway, Blessed be the Lord, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
servant.
And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness: and of thy praise
all the day long.
<h3>Psalm 35</h3>
For the end. By David the servant of the Lord
MY HEART sheweth me the wickedness of the ungodly: that there is no fear of
God before his eyes.
For he flattereth himself in his own sight: until his abominable sin be found out.
The words of his mouth are unrighteous, and full of deceit: he hath left off to
behave himself wisely, and to do good.
He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good way:
neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.
Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth unto the heavens: and thy faithfulness unto the
clouds.
Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: thy judgments are like the
great deep.
Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast; How excellent is thy mercy, O God:
and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy
wings.
They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house: and thou shalt give
them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.
For with thee is the well of life: and in thy light shall we see light.
O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee: and thy
righteousness unto them that are true of heart.
O let not the foot of pride come against me: and let not the hand of the ungodly
cast me down.
There are they fallen, all that work wickedness: they are cast down, and shall not
be able to stand.

<h3>Psalm 36</h3>
A psalm of David
FRET not thyself because of the ungodly: neither be thou envious against the
evil-doers.
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass: and be withered even as the
green herb.
Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good: dwell in the land, and verily
thou shalt be fed.
Delight thou in the Lord: and he shall give thee thy heart's desire.
Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him: and he shall bring it to
pass.
He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light ; and thy just dealing as the
noon-day.
Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon him: but grieve not thyself at
him whose way doth prosper, against the man that doeth after evil
counsels.
Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: fret not thyself, else shalt thou be
moved to do evil.
Wicked doers shall be rooted out: and they that patiently abide the Lord, those
shall inherit the land.
Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: thou shalt look after his
place, and he shall be away.
But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth: and shall be refreshed in the
multitude of peace.
The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just: and gnasheth upon him with his
teeth.
The Lord shall laugh him to scorn: for he hath seen that his day is coming.
The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow: to cast down
the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of a right conversation.
Their sword shall go through their own heart: and their bow shall be broken.
A small thing that the righteous hath: is better than great riches of the ungodly.
For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken: and the Lord upholdeth the
righteous.
The Lord knoweth the days of the godly: and their inheritance shall endure for
ever.
They shall not be confounded in the perilous time: and in the days of dearth they
shall have enough.
As for the ungodly, they shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord shall consume
as the fat of lambs: yea, even as the smoke shall they consume away.
The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous is merciful and
liberal.
Such as are blessed of God shall possess the land: and they that are cursed of
him shall be rooted out.
The Lord ordereth a good man's going: and maketh his way acceptable to
himself.
Though he fall, he shall not be cast away: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
hand.
I have been young, and now am old: and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging their bread.
The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth: and his seed is blessed.
Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good: and dwell for evermore.
For the Lord loveth the thing that is right: he forsaketh not his that be godly, but
they are preserved for ever.
The unrighteous shall be punished: as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be
rooted out.
The righteous shall inherit the land: and dwell therein forever.
The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and his tongue will be talking
of judgement.
The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not slide.
The ungodly seeth the righteous: and seeketh occasion to slay him.
The Lord will not leave him in his hand: nor condemn him when he is judged.
Hope thou in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee, that thou
shalt possess the land: when the ungodly shall perish, thou shalt see it.
I myself have seen the ungodly in great power: and flourishing like a green baytree.
I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him, but his place could no where be
found.
Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right: for that shall bring a
man peace at the last.
As for the transgressors, they shall perish together: and the end of the ungodly
is, they shall be rooted out at the last.
But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord: who is also their strength
in the time of trouble.
And the Lord shall stand by them, and save them: he shall deliver them from the
ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him.

        <h3>  THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. JOHN (10, 1-9)   </h3><p>The Lord said: Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door  into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.  But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter  openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and  leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,  and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not  follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. This parable  spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he  spake unto them. Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am  the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the  sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved,  and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and  to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have  it more abundantly.  </p>

O glorious teachers, you have shone forth upon all creation as lights of piety, and by the beauty of dogma, subdued heresies with the word of God.

O holy ones, You have well tended the flock of Christ, escaping the bondage of Egypt, and eluding the passions of Babylon, wherefore ye now make your abode above in Zion, throughout all ages.  With words and deeds of piety anointed as if with myrrh, O divine Hierarchs, you perform sacred and divine mysteries, hymning the Trinity one in essence throughout all ages.  </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Unto Him who dwelt in the womb of the holy Virgin ineffably restoring Adam, do we hymn and exalt throughout the ages.  </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The prophetic vision of the lawgiver on the mountain, * in the fire of the burning bush, * prefigured thy birthgiving O Ever-Virgin, * the salvation of us the faithful, * wherefore with never silent hymns we magnify thee.

O Christ Who hast exalted virtue, accept me as the prodigal, and have pity on me who chant: All-hymned and most glorious is the God of our fathers! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Right mightily strengthened by the law of Christ, the invincible martyrs rendered impotent the counsels of the iniquitous; and having lawfully reached the end of their life, they chanted: O all-hymned God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O divinely illumined martyrs of the Lord, set afire by the light of the Trinity, ye manifestly destroyed the darkness of torment and the gloom of delusion, chanting: All-hymned and most glorious is the God of our fathers! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> In thee the laws of nature are restored, for, beyond the laws of the flesh, thou hast given birth, O all-immaculate one, to Christ, the Bestower of the law, Who proclaimeth deliverance for all who chant: All-hymned and most glorious is the God of our fathers! </p><p><i class="note">Canon, of the Angels </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> We the faithful perceive thee, O Theotokos ..., Thou art Light without beginning, Who shone forth from the Father of light, O Master, and didst make the armies of the angels mirrors reflecting Thy never-waning radiance.

O Lord of all, Thou dost manifestly save the race of mankind through the supplications of the angels, for Thou hast assigned them to all believers who in an Orthodox manner hymn Thee, the all-hymned and most glorious God of our fathers.

<h3>THE HOLY GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATHEW (5:14-19)</h3><p> The Lord spake unto His disciples saying: Ye are the light of the world. A city

bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your 
light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father 
which is in heaven. Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the Prophets: I 
am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth 
pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 
Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach 
men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do 
and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

<h3>Psalm 37</h3>
A psalm of David . For remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day
PUT me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy heavy
displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me: and thy hand presseth me sore.
There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure: neither is there any
rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.
For my wickednesses are gone over my head: and are like a sore burden, too
heavy for me to bear.
My wounds stink, and are corrupt: through my foolishness.
I am brought into so great trouble and misery: that I go mourning all the day
long.
For my loins are filled with a sore disease: and there is no whole part in my body.
I am feeble, and sore smitten: I have roared for the very disquietness of my
heart.
Lord, thou knowest all my desire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me: and the sight of mine eyes is gone
from me.
My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble: and my
kinsmen stood afar off.
They also that sought after my life laid snares for me: and they that went about
to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit all the day long.
As for me I was like a deaf men, and heard not: and as one that is dumb, who
doth not open his mouth.
I became even as a man that heareth not: and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my
God.
I have required that they, even mine enemies should not triumph over me: for
when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me.
And I, truly, am set in the plague: and my heaviness is ever in my sight.
For I will confess my wickedness: and be sorry for my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are mighty: and they that hate me wrongfully are
many in number.
They also that reward evil for good are against me: because I follow the thing
that good is.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me.
Haste thee to help me: O Lord God of my salvation.
<h3>Psalm 38</h3>
For the end. A song of David, for Idithun
I SAID, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not in my tongue.
I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle: while the ungodly is in my sight.
I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even from good words;
but it was pain and grief to me.
My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire kindled: and at
the last I spake with my tongue;
Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may be certified
how long I have to live.
Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long: and mine age is even as
nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is altogether vanity.
For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth
up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.
And now, Lord, what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.
Deliver me from all mine offences: and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.
I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.
Take thy plague away from me: I am even consumed by the means of thy heavy
hand.
When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to
consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man
therefore is but vanity.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling: hold not thy
peace at my tears.
For I am a stranger with thee: and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence, and be no
more seen
<h3>Psalm 39</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
I WAITED patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and heard my calling.
He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay: and set my
feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth: even a thanksgiving unto our God.
Many shall see it, and fear: and shall put their trust in the Lord.
Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the Lord: and turned not unto the
proud, and to such as go about with lies.
O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like as be
also thy thoughts which are to us-ward: and yet there is no man that
ordereth them unto thee:
If I should declare them, and speak of them: they should be more than I am able
to express.
Sacrifice and meat-offering thou wouldest not: but mine ears hast thou opened.
Burnt-offerings, and sacrifice for sin, hast thou not required: then said I, Lo, I
come,
In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil thy will, O my
God: I am content to do it; yea, thy law is within my heart.
I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I will not refrain
my lips, O Lord, and that thou knowest.
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart: my talk hath been of thy truth
and of thy salvation.
I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth: from the great congregation.
Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord: let thy loving-kindness and thy
truth alway preserve me.
For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such hold upon
me that I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the
hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.
O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me: make haste, O Lord, to help me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after my soul to
destroy it: let them be driven backward and put to rebuke, that wish me
evil.
Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame: that say unto me, Fie upon
thee, fie upon thee.
Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let such as love thy
salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and needy: but the Lord careth for me.
Thou art my helper and redeemer: make no long tarrying, O my God.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 40</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him
in the time of trouble.
The Lord preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth:
and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.
The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick upon his bed: make thou all his bed in
his sickness.
I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies speak evil of me: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: and his heart conceiveth falsehood
within himself, and when he cometh forth he telleth it.
All mine enemies whisper together against me: even against me do they imagine
this evil.
Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him: and now that he lieth, let him
rise up no more.
Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted: who did also eat of my
bread, hath laid great wait for me.
But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord: raise thou me up again, and I shall reward
them.
By this I know thou favourest me: that mine enemy doth not triumph against me.
And when I am in my health, thou upholdest me: and shalt set me before thy face
for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: world without end. Amen.
<h3>Psalm 41</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: when shall I come to
appear before the presence of God?
My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where
is now thy God?
Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the
multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;
In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day.
Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted
within me?
Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his
countenance.
My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore will I remember thee concerning
the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermon.
One deep calleth another, because of the noise of the water-pipes: all thy waves
and storms are gone over me.
The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time: and in the nightseason did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me: why go I
thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword: while mine enemies that trouble
me cast me in the teeth;
Namely, while they say daily unto me: Where is now thy God?
Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.
<h3>Psalm 42</h3>
A psalm of David
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people:
O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.
For thou art the God of my strength, why hast thou put me from thee: and why
go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me: and bring me unto thy
holy hill, and to thy dwelling.
And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and
gladness: and upon the harp I will give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.

<h3>Psalm 43</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
WE HAVE heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us: what thou hast
done in their time of old;
How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted them in: how
thou hast destroyed the nations and cast them out.
For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword: neither was it
their own arm that helped them;
But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance: because
thou hadst a favour unto them.
Thou art my King, O God: send help unto Jacob.
Through thee will we overthrow our enemies: and in thy Name will we tread
them under, that rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow: it is not my sword that shall help me;
But it is thou that savest us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion that
hate us.
We make our boast of God all day long: and will praise thy Name for ever.
But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion: and goest not forth with our
armies.
Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies: so that they which hate us
spoil our goods.
Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep: and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Thou sellest thy people for nought: and takest no money for them.
Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours: to be laughed to scorn, and had
in derision of them that are round about us.
Thou makest us to be a by-word among the heathen: and that the people shake
their heads at us.
My confusion is daily before me: and the shame of my face hath covered me;
For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer: for the enemy and avenger.
And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee: nor behave
ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.
Our heart is not turned back: neither our steps gone out of thy way;
No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons: and covered us with
the shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to any
strange God: shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very secrets of
the heart.
For thy sake also are we killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep
appointed to be slain.
Up, Lord, why sleepest thou: awake, and be not absent from us for ever.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face: and forgettest our misery and trouble?
For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
ground.
Arise, and help us: and deliver us for thy mercy's sake.
<h3>Psalm 44</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses by the sons of Core, for instruction. A Song concerning the
beloved
MY HEART is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the thing which I have made
unto the King.
My tongue is the pen: of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, because God
hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most Mighty: according to thy
worship and renown.
Good luck have thou with thine honour: ride on, because of the word of truth , of
meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible
things.
Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be subdued unto thee: even in
the midst among the King's enemies.
Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, even thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia: out of the ivory palaces,
whereby they have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did
stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, incline thine ear ; forget also thine own
people, and thy father's house.
So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty: for his is thy Lord God, and
worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: like as the rich also among
the people shall make their supplication before thee.
The King's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work: the virgins that be
her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee.
With joy and gladness shall they be brought: and shall enter into the King's
palace.
Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children: whom thou mayest make princes
in all lands.
I will remember thy Name from one generation to another: therefore shall the
people give thanks unto thee, world without end.
<h3>Psalm 45</h3>
For the end. For the sons of Core; a psalm concerning secret things
GOD is our hope and strength: a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved: and though the hills be
carried into the midst of the sea;
Though the waters thereof rage and swell: and though the mountains shake at
the tempest of the same.
The rivers of the flood thereof shall make glad the city of God: the holy place of
the tabernacle of the most Highest.
God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed: God shall help
her, and that right early.
The heathen make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved: but God hath shewed
his voice, and the earth shall melt away.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.
O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord: what destruction he hath
brought upon the earth.
He maketh wars to cease in all the world: he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the
spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.
Be still then, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I
will be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

And the Christian people glorify thy birthgiving. </p><p>Now & ever ..., The Church proclaimeth thy birthgiving with Orthodox doctrines and divine hymnody, O Virgin Bride of God, for it venerateth the signs of the incarnation of thy Son. </p></div>

O new and hidden mystery! For how dost thou remain a virgin, having given birth to God in the flesh? Who can recount what Thou hast done, O Lord? For Thou hast shown Thyself to be the Son of one who should have been cursed to give birth to children amid grief. Yea, the fallen nature of women rejoiceth in Thee our God, because of the Theotokos. </p><p>Glory ..., Through thee, O most pure Mary, who alone art the Theotokos, hath the world been freed from the tempest of transgressions. Wherefore, having thee as a haven of salvation, we the faithful praise thy mighty works with hymnody. </p><p>Now & ever ..., The prophets of old hymned thy virginity, saying that thou wouldst give birth within time to the Timeless One, to the Word Who is beyond words, Christ our God, One of the Trinity.

<h3>Psalm 46</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O CLAP your hand together, all ye people: O sing unto God with the voice of
melody.
For the Lord is high, and to be feared: he is the great King upon all the earth.
He shall subdue the people under us: and the nations under our feet.
He shall choose out an heritage for us: even the worship of Jacob, whom he
loved.
God is gone up with a merry noise: and the Lord with the sound of the trump.
O sing praises, sing praises unto our God: O sing praises, sing praises unto our
King.
For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon his holy seat.
The princes of the people are joined unto the people of the God of Abraham: for
God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the earth, as it were with a
shield.
<h3>Psalm 47</h3>
A psalm of praise for the sons of Core on the second day of the week
GREAT is the Lord, and highly to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his
holy hill.
The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth: upon the north-side
lieth the city of the great King; God is well known in her palaces as a sure
refuge.
For lo, the kings of the earth: are gathered, and gone by together.
They marvelled to see such things: they were astonished, and suddenly cast
down.
Fear came there upon them, and sorrow: as upon a woman in her travail.
Thou shalt break the ships of the sea: through the east wind.
Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the
city of our God: God upholdeth the same for ever.
We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God: in the midst of thy temple.
O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's end: thy right
hand is full of righteousness.
Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad: because of thy
judgements.
Walk about Sion, and go round about her: and tell the towers thereof.
Mark well her bulwarks, set up her houses: that ye may tell them that come
after.
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he shall be our guide unto death.
<h3>Psalm 48</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O HEAR ye this, all ye people: ponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the
world;
High and low, rich and poor: one with another.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom: and my heart shall muse of understanding.
I will incline mine ear to the parable: and shew my dark speech upon the harp.
Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness: and when the wickedness of
my heels compasseth me round about?
There be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches.
But no man may deliver his brother: nor make agreement unto God for him;
For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that alone for ever;
Yea, though he live long: and see not the grave.
For he seeth that wise men also die, and perish together: as well as the ignorant
and foolish, and leave their riches for other.
And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever: and that their
dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the
lands after their own names.
Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour: seeing that he may be compared
unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them.
This is their foolishness: and their posterity praise their saying.
They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and the righteous shall
have domination over them in the morning: their beauty shall consume in
the sepulchre out of their dwelling.
But God hath delivered my soul from the place of hell: for he shall receive me.
Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich: or if the glory of his house be
increased.
For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth: neither shall his pomp
follow him.
For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man: and so long as thou doest
well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.
He shall follow the generation of his fathers: and shall never see light.
Man being in honour hath no understanding: but is compared unto the beasts
that perish.

<h3>Psalm 49</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
THE Lord, even the most mighty God, hath spoken: and called the world, from
the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Out of Sion hath God appeared: in perfect beauty.
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: there shall go before him a
consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up round about him.
He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth, that he may judge his people.
Gather my saints together unto me: those that have made a covenant with me
with sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is Judge himself.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak: I myself will testify against thee, O Israel;
for I am God, even thy God.
I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt-offerings:
because they were not alway before me.
I will take no bullock out of thine house: nor he-goat out of thy folds.
For all the beasts of the forest are mine: and so are the cattle upon a thousand
hills.
I know all the fowls upon the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are in
my sight.
If I be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the whole world is mine, and all that is
therein.
Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh: and drink the blood of goats?
Offer unto God thanksgiving: and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.
And call upon me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise
me.
But unto the ungodly said God: Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my
covenant in thy mouth;
Whereas thou hatest to be reformed: and has cast my words behind thee?
When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him: and hast been partaker
with the adulterers.
Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness: and with thy tongue thou hast set
forth deceit.
Thou satest, and spakest against thy brother: yea, and hast slandered thine own
mother's son.
These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest
wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and
set before thee the things that thou hast done.
O consider this, ye that forget God: lest I pluck you away, and there be none to
deliver you.
Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation right will I shew the salvation of God.
<h3>Psalm 50</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to
Bathsheba
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according to the
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.
Wash me throughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.
Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin hath my mother conceived me.
But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand
wisdom secretly.
Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice.
Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.
Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health: and
my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.
Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy praise.
For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou delightest not in
burnt-offerings.
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt
thou not despise.
O be favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burntofferings and oblations: then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine
altar.

<h3>Psalm 51</h3>
For the end. A psalm of instruction by David, when Doeg the Idumean came and told Saul that
David had gone to the house of Abimelech
WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant: that thou canst do mischief;
Whereas the goodness of God: endureth yet daily?
Thy tongue imagineth wickedness: and with lies thou cuttest like a sharp rasor.
Thou hast loved unrighteousness more then goodness: and to talk of lies more
than righteousness.
Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt: O thou false tongue.
Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever: he shall take thee, and pluck thee out
of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of the living.
The righteous also shall see this, and fear: and shall laugh him to scorn;
Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength: but trusted unto the
multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: my trust is in the
tender mercy of God for ever and ever.
I will always give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done: and I will hope in thy
Name, for thy saints like it well.
<h3>Psalm 52</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David upon Maeleth, of instruction
THE foolish body hath said in his heart: There is no God.
Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness: there is none that
doeth good.
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there were any
that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is also none that doeth good, no not one.
Are not they without understanding, that work wickedness: eating up my people
as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.
They were afraid where no fear was: for God hath broken the bones of him that
besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because God hath despised
them.
O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion: O that the Lord would
deliver his people out of captivity!
Then should Jacob rejoice: and Israel should be right glad.
<h3>Psalm 53</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of instruction by David. When the Ziphites came and said to Saul,
Lo, is not David hid with us?
SAVE me, O God, for thy Name's sake: and avenge me in thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God: and hearken unto the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me: and tyrants, which have not God before
their eyes, seek after my soul.
Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy truth.
An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O Lord: because
it is so comfortable.
For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire
upon mine enemies.
<h3>Psalm 54</h3>
For the end. Among hymns of instruction by David
HEAR my prayer, O God: and hide not thyself from my petition.
Take heed unto me, and hear me: how I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed.
The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast: for they are minded to
do me some mischief; so maliciously are they set against me.
My heart is disquieted within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me: and an horrible dread hath
overwhelmed me.
And I said, O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I flee away, and be at
rest.
Lo, then would I get me away far off: and remain in the wilderness.
I would make haste to escape: because of the stormy wind and tempest.
Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them: for I have spied unrighteousness
and strife in the city.
Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow
are in the midst of it.
Wickedness is therein: deceit and guile go not out of their streets.
For it is not an open enemy, that hath done me this dishonour: for then I could
have borne it.
Neither was it mine adversary, that did magnify himself against me: for then
peradventure I would have hid myself from him.
But it was even thou, my companion: my guide, and mine own familiar friend.
We took sweet counsel together: and walked in the house of God as friends.
Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for
wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord shall save me.
In the evening, and morning, and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly: and
he shall hear my voice.
It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
for there were many with me.
Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them down: for
they will not turn, nor fear God.
He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him: and he brake his covenant.
The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart: his
words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very swords.
O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: and shall not suffer
the righteous to fall for ever.
And as for them: thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction.
The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days:
nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.

<h3>Psalm 55</h3>
For the end. Concerning the people that were removed from the sanctuary. By David for a
memorial, when the Philistines caught him in Gath
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me: he is daily
fighting, and troubling me.
Mine enemies are daily in hand to swallow me up: for they be many that fight
against me, O thou most Highest.
Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid: yet put I my trust in thee.
I will praise God, because of his word: I have put my trust in God, and will not
fear what flesh can do unto me.
They daily mistake my words: all that they imagine is to do me evil.
They hold all together, and keep themselves close: and mark my steps, when
they lay wait for my soul.
Shall they escape for their wickedness: thou, O God, in thy displeasure shalt cast
them down.
Thou tellest my flittings; put my tears into thy bottle: are not these things noted
in thy book?
Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight: this I
know; for God is on my side.
In God's word I will rejoice: in the Lord's word will I comfort me.
Yea, in God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows: unto thee will I give thanks.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling: that I may
walk before God in the light of the living.
<h3>Psalm 56</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David, for a memorial. When he fled from the presence of Saul to
the cave
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, be merciful unto me, for my soul trusteth in
thee: and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until this
tyranny be over-past.
I will call unto the most high God: even unto the God that shall perform the
cause which I have in hand.
He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him that would eat
me up.
God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among lions.
And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are
spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they have digged a
pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, and give praise.
Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee
among the nations.
For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens: and thy truth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 57</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation: and do ye judge the
thing that is right, O ye sons of men?
Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth: and your hands deal with
wickedness.
The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb: as soon as they are
born, they go astray, and speak lies.
They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent: even like the deaf adder that
stoppeth her ears.
Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer: charm he never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; smite the jaw-bones of the lions, O
Lord: let them fall away like water that runneth apace; and when they
shoot their arrows let them be rooted out.
Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of a woman:
and let them not see the sun.
Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns: so let indignation vex him, even as a
thing that is raw.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his
footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: doubtless
there is a God that judgeth the earth.

<h3>Psalm 58</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David for a memorial, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill
him
DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God: defend me from them that rise up
against me.
O deliver me from the wicked doers: and save me from the blood-thirsty men.
For lo, they lie waiting for my soul: the mighty men are gathered against me,
without any offence or fault of me, O Lord.
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: arise thou therefore to help
me, and behold.
Stand up, O Lord God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the heathen: and be
not merciful unto them that offend of malicious wickedness.
They go to and fro in the evening: they grin like a dog, and run about through the
city.
Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips: for who doth
hear?
But thou. O Lord, shalt have them in derision: and thou shalt laugh all the
heathen to scorn.
My strength will I ascribe unto thee: for thou art the God of my refuge.
God sheweth me his goodness plenteously: and God shall let me see my desire
upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget it: but scatter them abroad among the
people, and put them down, O Lord, our defence.
For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be taken in
their pride: and why? their preaching is of cursing and lies.
Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish: and know that
it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.
And in the evening they will return: grin like a dog, and will go about the city.
They will run here and there for meat: and grudge if they be not satisfied.
As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betimes in the
morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
trouble.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my
merciful God.
<h3>Psalm 59</h3>
For the end. For them that shall yet be changed. For an inscription by David for instruction.
When he had burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syrian Sobal, and Joab had returned and smitten
twelve thousand in the Valley of Salt
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad: thou hast also been
displeased; O turn thee unto us again.
Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: heal the sores thereof, for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewed thy people heavy things: thou hast given us a drink of deadly
wine.
Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee: that they may triumph because of
the truth.
Therefore were thy beloved delivered: help me with thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Sichem: and mete out
the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head;
Judah is my law-giver.
Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, be thou glad
of me.
Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou cast us out, O God: wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
O be thou our help in trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Through God will we do great acts: for it is he that shall tread down our enemies.
<h3>Psalm 60</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of David
HEAR my crying, O God: give ear unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth will I call unto thee: when my heart is in heaviness.
O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I: for thou hast been my hope, and
a strong tower for me against the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: and my trust shall be under the covering of
thy wings.
For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires: and hast given an heritage unto those
that fear thy Name.
Thou shalt grant the King a long life: that his years may endure throughout all
generations.
He shall dwell before God for ever: O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness,
that they may preserve him.
So will I always sing praise unto thy Name: that I may daily perform my vows.

<h3>Psalm 61</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David for Idithun
MY SOUL truly waiteth still upon God: for of him cometh my salvation.
He verily is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
greatly fall.
How long will ye imagine mischief against every man: ye shall be slain all the
sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and like a broken hedge.
Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt: their delight is in
lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse with their heart.
Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God: for my hope is in him.
He truly is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
fall.
In God is my health, and my glory: the rock of my might, and in God is my trust.
O put your trust in him alway, ye people: pour out your hearts before him, for
God is our hope.
As for the children of men, they are but vanity: the children of men are deceitful
upon the weights, they are altogether lighter than vanity itself.
O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselves unto vanity: if riches
increase, set not your heart upon them.
God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same: that power belongeth
unto God;
And that thou, Lord, art merciful: for thou rewardest every man according to his
work.
<h3>Psalm 62</h3>
A psalm of David. When he was in the wilderness of Idumea
O GOD, thou art my God: early will I seek thee.
My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee: in a barren and dry
land where no water is.
Thus have I looked for thee in holiness: that I might behold thy power and glory.
For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: my lips shall praise thee.
As long as I live will I magnify thee on this manner: and lift up my hands in thy
Name.
My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness: when my
mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.
Have I not remembered thee in my bed: and thought upon thee when I was
waking?
Because thou hast been my helper: therefore under the shadow of thy wings will
I rejoice.
My soul hangeth upon thee: thy right hand hath upholden me.
These also that seek the hurt of my soul: they shall go under the earth.
Let them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be a portion for foxes.
But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him shall be
commended: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
<h3>Psalm 63</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the gathering together of the froward: and from the insurrection of
wicked doers;
Who have whet their tongue like a sword: and shoot out their arrows, even bitter
words;
That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: suddenly do they hit him, and
fear not.
They encourage themselves in mischief: and commune among themselves how
they may lay snares, and say that no man shall see them.
They imagine wickedness, and practise it: that they keep secret among
themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.
But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow: that they shall be
wounded.
Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall insomuch that whoso seeth them
shall laugh them to scorn.
And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done: for they shall perceive that
it is his work.
The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and put his trust in him: and all they that
are true of heart shall be glad.

For this cause the soul of each of the faithful doth glorify thee. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The stone which the builders have rejected ..., O Forerunner who sprang forth in a sacred manner from a barren and childless woman, thou wast revealed to be fruitful in divine deeds; wherefore, my heart, which is in all ways unfruitful, do thou render fruitful in good works, that I may ever faithfully glorify thee. With the bread of heaven, O blessed one, fortify my heart which is paralyzed by wicked thoughts; and grant that I may earnestly do the will of the all- compassionate God, that I may ever glorify thee with faith. Thou didst preach the Lamb Who taketh away the sins of the world, O blessed prophet. Ease thou the heavy burden of my sins, I pray, granting me compunction, which washeth away the defilements of the passions. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The Word Who issued forth bearing flesh from thee, O Theotokos, clothed Himself wholly in Adam.

The riches Thou gavest me have I squandered, O Christ, wickedly committing unseemly deeds; and being naked, I clothed myself in works of ungodliness. Wherefore, I cry to Thee: Taking pity on me in Thy divine goodness, clothe me again in my primal vesture. I have been brought low by mindlessness, have fallen grievously, and lie on the ground, incurably sick. Raise me up, O Christ, Thou restoration of the fallen, and establish my heart on the rock of saving repentance. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Emulating Christ Who was lifted up upon the Cross, and accepting wounds, the passion-bearers rejoiced together, and with the showers of their blood caused the showers of polytheism to cease, pouring forth streams of healing. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Navigating with the hope of salvation as your rudder, O divine spiritual athletes, ye traversed the violence of tortures and waves of bitterness dryshod, and hastened to the harbor on high, full of all gladness. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Beholding thee, the angelic armies were amazed at how He Whose visage is invisible through thee took on visible form like unto ours, O Virgin Birthgiver of God.

Let a drop of salvation fall upon me who am withering away through the burning of the passions, O Forerunner, who submerged in the streams of the Jordan Jesus the Bestower of life, the Torrent of sweetness, that I may glorify thee as is meet. It is neither an angel nor a mediator who hath saved us, but the Lord Himself, Who came to earth, and for Whom thou didst make the ways straight, O blessed one. Him do thou now entreat, that He show me the path which leadeth to the kingdom. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thou hast been shown to be a sanctified temple of God, Who dwelt within thee in a manner past understanding, O Virgin.

By thy supplications do thou strengthen all to keep this law, that we may be delivered from the countless evils we ever commit. Pursuing all mastery, O wise one, thou didst tread the narrow path, being wholly illumined by the breadth of splendid divine visions. And beseeching Christ, grant that we also may de­light therein.

With the incorporeal angels, with the honored apostles, with the sacred passion-bearers, and with the prophets, O Forerunner, ever entreat the supremely good God, that we who are ever enriched by thee, our good intercessor, may receive everlasting good things.

<h3>Psalm 64</h3>
For the end. A psalm and song of David
THOU, O God, art praised in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed in
Jerusalem.
Thou that hearest the prayer: unto thee shall all flesh come.
My misdeeds prevail against me: O be thou merciful unto our sins.
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: he shall dwell
in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house, even of
thy holy temple.
Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation: thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that remain in the broad sea.
Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains: and is girded about with power.
Who stilleth the raging of the sea: and the noise of his waves, and the madness of
the people.
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afraid at thy
tokens: thou that makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
praise thee.
Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very plenteous.
The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest
for the earth.
Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof: thou
makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop fatness.
They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and the little hills shall
rejoice on every side.
The folds shall be full of sheep: the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn,
that they shall laugh and sing.
<h3>Psalm 65</h3>
For the end. A song of a plasm of resurrection
O BE joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of his Name, make
his praise to be glorious.
Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the greatness of
thy power shall thine enemies be found liars unto thee.
For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy Name.
O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is in his doing
toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the water on foot;
there did we rejoice thereof.
He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people: and such as will
not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.
O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to slip.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our loins.
Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water, and
thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay thee my vows, which I
promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of rams: I will offer
bullocks and goats.
O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what he hath
done for my soul.
I called unto him with my mouth: and gave him praises with my tongue.
If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart: the Lord will not hear me.
But God hath heard me: and considered the voice of my prayer.
Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned his mercy from me.
<h3>Psalm 66</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns
GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his countenance,
and be merciful unto us:
That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the folk righteously,
and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God, shall
give us his blessing.
God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 67</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song of David
LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee
before him.
Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away: and like as wax
melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the presence of God.
But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them also be merry and
joyful .
O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name: magnify him that rideth upon
the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise him in his Name JAH, and
rejoice before him.
He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows: even God
in his holy habitation.
He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the
prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates continue in scarceness.
O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through
the wilderness;
The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God: even as Sinai
also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.
Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreshedst it
when it was weary.
Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness
prepared for the poor.
The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers.
Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited: and they of the household
divided the spoil.
Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove: that
is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.
When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake: then were they as white as
snow in Salmon.
As the hill of Basan, so is God's hill: even an high hill, as the hill of Basan.
Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which it pleaseth him to
dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: and the Lord
is among them, as in the holy place of Sinai.
Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for
men: yea, even for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among
them.
Praised be the Lord daily: even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his benefits
upon us.
He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is the Lord, by
whom we escape death.
God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalp of such a one as
goeth on still in his wickedness.
The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan: mine own
will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the tongue of
thy dogs may be red through the same.
It is well seen, O God, how thou goest: how thou, my God and King, goest in the
sanctuary.
The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the damsels
playing with the timbrels.
Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations: from the ground
of the heart.
There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their counsel: the
princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.
Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing, O God, that thou
hast wrought in us,
For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem: so shall kings bring presents unto thee.
When the company of the spear-men, and multitude of the mighty are scattered
abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they humbly bring pieces of
silver: and when he hath scattered the people that delight in war;
Then shall the princes come out of Eqypt: the Morians' land shall soon stretch
our her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord;
Who sitteth in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he doth send out his
voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.
Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel: his worship and strength is in the
clouds.
O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: even the God of Israel, he will give
strength and power unto his people; blessed be God.

<h3>Psalm 68</h3>
For the end. A Psalm of David for alternate verses
SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.
I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is: I am come into deep waters, so
that the floods run over me.
I am weary of crying; my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for waiting so long
upon my God.
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that
are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.
I paid them the things that I never took: God, thou knowest my simpleness, and
my faults are not hid from thee.
Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my cause:
let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of
Israel.
And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof: shame hath covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an alien unto my mother's
children.
For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me: and the rebukes of them that
rebuked thee are fallen upon me.
I wept, and chastened myself with fasting: and that was turned to my reproof.
I put on sackcloth also: and they jested upon me.
They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs upon
me.
But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.
Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the truth of thy salvation.
Take me out of the mire, that I sink not: O let me be delivered from them that
hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up: and let
not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable: turn thee unto me
according to the multitude of thy mercies.
And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: O haste thee, and
hear me.
Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: O deliver me, because of mine enemies.
Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are
all in thy sight.
Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to
have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.
They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and let the things that
should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.
Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not: and ever bow thou down their backs.
Pour out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold
of them.
Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they talk how they may vex
them whom thou hast wounded.
Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and not come into thy
righteousness.
Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be written among the
righteous.
As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God, shall lift me up.
I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with thanksgiving.
This also shall please the Lord: better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God, and your soul
shall live.
For the Lord heareth the poor: and despiseth not his prisoners.
Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea, and all that moveth therein.
For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah: that men may dwell there,
and have it in possession.
The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his Name
shall dwell therein.
<h3>Psalm 69</h3>
For the end. By David for a remembrance; that the Lord may save me
HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned
backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.
Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame: that cry over me, There,
there.
But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let all such as
delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and in misery: haste thee unto me, O God.
Thou art my helper and my redeemer: O Lord, make no long tarrying.

<h3>Psalm 70</h3>
By David. A psalm sung by the sons of Jonadab and the first that were taken captive
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: but rid
me and deliver me in thy righteousness, incline thine ear unto me, and save
me.
Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may alway resort: thou hast promised to
help me, for thou art my house of defence and my castle.
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the hand of the
unrighteous and cruel man.
For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope, even from
my youth.
Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: thou art he that took
me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall be always of thee.
I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is in thee.
O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy glory and honour
all the day long.
Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength faileth
me.
For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul take their
counsel together, saying: God hath forsaken him; persecute him, and take
him, for there is none to deliver him.
Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me.
Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul: let them be covered
with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.
As for me, I will patiently abide alway: and will praise thee more and more.
My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation: for I know no end
thereof.
I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy
righteousness only.
Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I tell of
thy wondrous works.
Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed: until I have
shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that
are yet for to come.
Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are they that thou hast
done; O God, who is like unto thee?
O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me, and yet didst thou
turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth
again.
Thou hast brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every side.
Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an
instrument of musick: unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Holy One
of Israel.
My lips will be fain when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul whom thou hast
delivered.
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are
confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.
<h3>Psalm 71</h3>
For Solomon
GIVE the King thy judgements, O God: and thy righteousness unto the King's
son.
Then shall he judge thy people according unto right: and defend the poor.
The mountains also shall bring peace: and the little hills righteousness unto the
people.
He shall keep the simple folk by their right: defend the children of the poor, and
punish the wrong-doer.
They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth: from one generation
to another.
He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool: even as the drops that
water the earth.
In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea, and abundance of peace, so long as
the moon endureth.
His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other: and from the flood unto
the world's end.
They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him: his enemies shall lick
the dust.
The kings of Tharsis and of the isles shall give presents: the kings of Arabia and
Saba shall bring gifts.
All kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do him service.
For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth: the needy also, and him that hath
no helper.
He shall be favourable to the simple and needy: and shall preserve the souls of
the poor.
He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong: and dear shall their blood
be in his sight.
He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia: prayer shall be
made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.
There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills: his fruit shall
shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city like grass upon the earth.
His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the
posterities: which shall be blessed through him; and all the heathen shall
praise him.
Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel: which only doeth wondrous
things;
And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: and all the earth shall be filled
with his majesty. Amen, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 72</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
TRULY God is loving unto Israel: even unto such as are of a clean heart.
Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone: my treadings had well-nigh slipt.
And why? I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such
prosperity.
For they are in no peril of death: but are lusty and strong.
They come in no misfortune like other folk: neither are they plagued like other
men.
And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride: and overwhelmed with
cruelty.
Their eyes swell with fatness: and they do even what they lust.
They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy: their talking is against the
most High.
For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their tongue goeth
through the world.
Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no small advantage.
Tush, say they, how should God perceive it: is there knowledge in the most High?
Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in
possession: and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed
mine hands in innocency.
All the day long have I been punished: and chastened every morning.
Yea, and I had almost said even as they: but lo, then I should have condemned
the generation of thy children.
Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me,
Until I went into the sanctuary of God: then understood I the end of these men;
Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places: and castest them down, and
destroyest them.
O how suddenly do they consume: perish, and come to a fearful end!
Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh: so shalt thou make their image to
vanish out of the city.
Thus my heart was grieved: and it went even through my reins.
So foolish was I, and ignorant: even as it were a beast before thee.
Nevertheless, I am alway by thee: for thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel: and after that receive me with glory.
Whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth that I desire in
comparison of thee.
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my
portion for ever.
For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that
commit fornication against thee.
But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord God: and
to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
<h3>Psalm 73</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot
against the sheep of thy pasture?
O think upon thy congregation: whom thou hast purchased and redeemed of old.
Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance: and mount Sion, wherein thou hast
dwelt.
Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy: which hath done
evil in thy sanctuary.
Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations: and set up their
banners for tokens.
He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees: was known to bring it to an
excellent work.
But now they break down all the carved work thereof: with axes and hammers.
They have set fire upon thy holy places: and have defiled the dwelling-place of
thy Name, even unto the ground.
Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether: thus have
they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.
We see not our tokens, there is not one prophet more: no, not one is there among
us, that understandeth any more.
O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour: how long shall the enemy
blaspheme thy Name, for ever?
Why withdrawest thou thy hand: why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy
bosom to consume the enemy?
For God is my King of old: the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself.
Thou didst divide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the
dragons in the waters.
Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces: and gavest him to be meat for the
people in the wilderness.
Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks: thou driedst up
mighty waters.
The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked: and how the foolish
people hath blasphemed thy Name.
O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the enemies: and
forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.
Look upon the covenant: for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel
habitations.
O let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the poor and needy give praise
unto thy Name.
Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
blasphemeth thee daily.
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the presumption of them that hate thee
increaseth ever more and more.

<h3>Psalm 74</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: A psalm of a song for Asaph
UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks: yea, unto thee do we give thanks.
Thy Name also is so nigh: and that do thy wondrous works declare.
When I receive the congregation: I shall judge according unto right.
The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the pillars of it.
I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly: and to the ungodly, Set not up your horn.
Set not up your horn on high: and speak not with a stiff neck.
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west: nor yet from the
south.
And why? God is the Judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixed,
and he poureth out of the same.
As for the dregs thereof: all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and suck
them out.
But I will talk of the God of Jacob: and praise him for ever.
All the horns of the ungodly also will I break: and the horns of the righteous shall
be exalted.
<h3>Psalm 75</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns, a psalm for Asaph: A song for the Assyrian
IN JEWRY is God known: his Name is great in Israel.
At Salem is his tabernacle: and his dwelling in Sion.
There brake he the arrows of the bow: the shield, the sword, and the battle.
Thou art of more honour and might: than the hills of the robbers.
The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep: and all the men whose hands
were mighty have found nothing.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob: both the chariot and horse are fallen.
Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when thou art
angry?
Thou didst cause thy judgement to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled,
and was still;
When God arose to judgement: and to help all the meek upon earth.
The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise: and the fierceness of them shalt
thou refrain.
Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that are round about him:
bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
He shall refrain the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among the kings of the
earth.
<h3>Psalm 76</h3>
For the end. For Idithun, a psalm of Asaph
I WILL cry unto God with my voice: even unto God will I cry with my voice, and
he shall hearken unto me.
In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran and ceased not in the
night-season ; my soul refused comfort.
When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God: when my heart is vexed, I will
complain.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble, that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old: and the years that are past.
I call to remembrance my song: and in the night I commune with mine own
heart, and search out my spirits.
Will the Lord absent himself for ever: and will he be no more intreated?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly to an end for
evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his loving-kindness in
displeasure?
And I said, It is mine own infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right
hand of the most Highest.
I will remember the works of the Lord: and call to mind thy wonders of old time.
I will think also of all thy works: and my talking shall be of thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is holy: who is so great a God as our God?
Thou art the God that doeth wonders: and hast declared thy power among the
people.
Thou hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid: the depths
also were troubled.
The clouds poured out water, the air thundered: and thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: the lightnings shone upon the
ground: the earth was moved, and shook withal.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and thy footsteps are
not known.
Thou leddest thy people like sheep: by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<h3>Psalm 77</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
HEAR my law, O my people: incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hard sentences of old;
Which we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told us;
That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to come: but
to shew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he
hath done.
He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law: which he commanded our
forefathers to teach their children;
That their posterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn;
To the intent that when they came up: they might shew their children the same;
That they might put their trust in God: and not to forget the works of God, but to
keep his commandments;
And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation: a
generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not
stedfastly unto God;
Like as the children of Ephraim: who being harnessed, and carrying bows,
turned themselves back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his law;
But forgat what he had done: and the wonderful works that he had shewed for
them.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt:
even in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea, and let them go through: he made the waters to stand on an
heap.
In the day-time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night through with a
light of fire.
He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness: and gave them drink thereof, as it had
been out of the great depth.
He brought waters out of the stony rock: so that it gushed out like the rivers.
Yet for all this they sinned more against him: and provoked the most Highest in
the wilderness.
They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their lust.
They spake against God also, saying: Shall God prepare a table in the
wilderness?
He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
flowed withal: but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?
When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and
there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;
Because they believed not in God: and put not their trust in his help.
So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.
He rained down manna also upon them for to eat: and gave them food from
heaven.
So man did eat angels' food: for he sent them meat enough.
He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven: and through his power he
brought in the south-west-wind.
He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand
of the sea.
He let it fall among their tents: even round about their habitation.
So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire: they were
not disappointed of their lust.
But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon
them, and slew the wealthiest of them: yea, and smote down the chosen
men that were in Israel.
But for all this they sinned yet more: and believed not his wondrous works.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years in trouble.
When he slew them, they sought him: and turned them early, and inquired after
God.
And they remembered that God was their strength: and that the high God was
their redeemer.
Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and dissembled with him
in their tongue.
For their heart was not whole with him: neither continued they stedfast in his
covenant.
But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds: and destroyed them not.
Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not suffer his whole
displeasure to arise.
For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were even a wind that
passeth away, and cometh not again.
Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness: and grieved him in the
desert.
They turned back, and tempted God: and moved the Holy One in Israel.
They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered them from the
hand of the enemy;
How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
He turned their waters into blood: so that they might not drink of the rivers.
He sent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to destroy them.
He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar: and their labour unto the grasshopper.
He destroyed their vines with hail-stones: and their mulberry-trees with the frost.
He smote their cattle also with hail-stones: and their flocks with hot
thunderbolts.
He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure and trouble:
and sent evil angels among them.
He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death: but gave
their life over to the pestilence;
And smote all the first-born in Egypt: the most principal and mightiest in the
dwellings of Ham.
But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep: and carried them in the
wilderness like a flock.
He brought them out safely, that they should not fear: and overwhelmed their
enemies with the sea.
And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary: even to his mountain
which he purchased with his right hand.
He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land to be divided among
them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not his testimonies;
But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers: starting aside like a
broken bow.
For they grieved him with their hill-altars: and provoked him to displeasure with
their images.
When God heard this, he was wroth: and took sore displeasure at Israel.
So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that he had pitched
among men.
He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with his inheritance.
The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not given to
marriage.
Their priests were slain with the sword: and there were no widows to make
lamentation.
So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep: and like a giant refreshed with wine.
He smote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a perpetual shame.
He refused the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
But chose the tribe of Judah: even the hill of Sion which he loved.
And there he built his temple on high: and laid the foundation of it like the
ground which he hath made continually.
He chose David also his servant: and took him away from the sheep-folds.
As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him: that he might
feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
So he fed them with a faithful and true heart: and ruled them prudently with all
his power.

<h3>Psalm 78</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they
defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the
air: and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.
Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem: and there was
no man to bury them.
We are become an open shame to our enemies: a very scorn and derision unto
them that are round about us.
Lord, how long wilt thou be angry: shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?
Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee: and upon
the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.
For they have devoured Jacob: and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon: for we are
come to great misery.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: O deliver us, and be
merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake.
Wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?
O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed: be openly shewed upon
the heathen in our sight.
O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to the
greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die.
And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee: reward
thou them , O Lord, seven-fold into their bosom.
So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for
ever: and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to
generation.
<h3>Psalm 79</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses. A testimony for Asaph: a Psalm concerning the Assyrian
HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep: shew
thyself also, thou that sittest upon the cherubims.
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses: stir up thy strength, and come, and
help us.
Turn us again, O God: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
O Lord God of hosts: how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears: and givest them plenteousness of
tears to drink.
Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh us
to scorn.
Turn us again, thou God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall
be whole.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and
planted it.
Thou madest room for it: and when it had taken root it filled the land.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it: and the boughs thereof were like
the goodly cedar-trees.
She stretched out her branches unto the sea: and her boughs unto the river.
Why hast thou then broken down her hedge: that all they that go by pluck off her
grapes?
The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up: and the wild beasts of the field
devour it.
Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven: behold, and visit this
vine;
And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted: and the branch
that thou madest so strong for thyself.
It is burnt with fire, and cut down: and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy
countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man, whom
thou madest so strong for thine own self.
And so will not we go back from thee: O let us live, and we shall call upon thy
Name.
Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.
<h3>Psalm 80</h3>
For the end. A psalm for Asaph, concerning the winepresses
SING we merrily unto God our strength: make a cheerful noise unto the God of
Jacob.
Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret: the merry harp with the lute.
Blow up the trumpet in the new-moon: even in the time appointed, and upon our
solemn feast-day.
For this was made a statute for Israel: and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony: when he came out of the land of
Egypt, and had heard a strange language.
I eased his shoulder from the burden: and his hands were delivered from making
the pots.
Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee: and heard thee what
time as the storm fell upon thee.
I proved thee also: at the waters of strife.
Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel: if thou wilt hearken unto me,
There shall no strange god be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any other god.
I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy
mouth wide, and I shall fill it.
But my people would not hear my voice: and Israel would not obey me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts: and let them follow their own
imaginations.
O that my people would have hearkened unto me: for if Israel had walked in my
ways,
I should soon have put down their enemies: and turned my hand against their
adversaries.
The haters of the Lord should have been found liars: but their time should have
endured for ever.
He should have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour: and with honey out of
the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

<h3>Psalm 81</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
GOD standeth in the congregation of princes: he is a Judge among gods.
How long will ye give wrong judgement: and accept the persons of the ungodly?
Defend the poor and fatherless: see that such as are in need and necessity have
right.
Deliver the outcast and poor: save them from the hand of the ungodly.
They will not be learned nor understand, but walk on still in darkness: all the
foundations of the earth are out of course.
I have said, Ye are gods: and ye are all the children of the most Highest.
But ye shall die like men: and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth: for thou shalt take all heathen to thine
inheritance.
<h3>Psalm 82</h3>
A song of a psalm for Asaph
HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: refrain not thyself, O God.
For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring: and they that hate thee have lift up
their head.
They have imagined craftily against thy people: and taken counsel against thy
secret ones.
They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people:
and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
For they have cast their heads together with one consent: and are confederate
against thee;
The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismaelites: the Moabites and
Hagarenes;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek: the Philistines, with them that dwell at Tyre.
Assur also is joined with them: and have holpen the children of Lot.
But do thou to them as unto the Madianites: unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the
brook of Kison;
Who perished at Endor: and became as the dung of the earth.
Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeb: yea, make all their princes like
as Zeba and Salmana;
Who say, Let us take to ourselves: the houses of God in possession.
O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and as the stubble before the wind;
Like as the fire that burneth up the wood: and as the flame that consumeth the
mountains.
Persecute them even so with thy tempest: and make them afraid with thy storm.
Make their faces ashamed, O Lord: that they may seek thy Name.
Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more: let them be put to
shame, and perish.
And they shall know that thou, whose Name is Jehovah: art only the most Highest
over all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 83</h3>
For the end. A song for the sons of Core, concerning the winepresses
O HOW amiable are thy dwellings: thou Lord of hosts!
My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the Lord: my heart
and my flesh rejoice in the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest where she may
lay her young: even thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be alway praising thee.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are thy ways.
Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well: and the pools are filled
with water.
They will go from strength to strength: and unto the God of gods appeareth every
one of them in Sion.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer :hearken, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our defender: and look upon the face of thine Anointed.
For one day in thy courts: is better than a thousand.
I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God: than to dwell in the tents
of ungodliness.
For the Lord God is a light and defence: the Lord will give grace and worship,
and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a godly life.
O Lord God of hosts: blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 84</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou hast turned away the
captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people: and covered all their sins.
Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure: and turned thyself from thy wrathful
indignation.
Turn us then, O God our Saviour: and let thine anger cease from us.
Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever: and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from
one generation to another?
Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Shew us thy mercy, O Lord: and grant us thy salvation.
I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak
peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again.
For his salvation is nigh them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each
other.
Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness hath looked down from
heaven.
Yea, the Lord shall shew loving-kindness: and our land shall give her increase.
Righteousness shall go before him: and he shall direct his going in the way.

Thou art the Lord of glory, O Thou Who hast crowned mankind with glory; and Thou wast crowned with thorns, that Thou mightest make fruitful our thorny nature, O Planter of divine deeds. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The most holy assembly of the saints who suffered lawfully sanctified all creation with the outpouring of their blood and in God the Father abolished the abominable sacrifices offered to the demons. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O most holy martyrs, clouds of tortures did not obscure your patient struggles; wherefore, ye were revealed to be brighter than the beams of the sun, O glorious ones, manifestly emitting rays of salvation. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O most pure one, thou wast consumed by the sword of the sufferings of thy Son, for thou didst see pierced by a spear Him Who hath withdrawn the sword which barred the way into paradise, and which forbade divine entry even to the faithful. </p><p><i class="note">Another canon, of the Theotokos, in Tone I:  </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i></i> Thy victorious right arm, * in a manner befitting God, * hath been glorified in strength, O Immortal One; * for in its infinite strength it shattered the enemy, * fashioning anew a path for the Israelites through the deep.  Grant me streams of spiritual tears, O all-immaculate one who gavest rise to the Wellspring of remission Who washeth away the defilement of sin and bringeth forth my life in humility. In conceiving God, thou didst become more exalted than creation, O pure one; wherefore, I beseech thee: Raise me up out of the mire of the passions, and lead me up to the divine heights of dispassion. On the day of judgment show thyself to be merciful unto me, I pray, O pure one, delivering me from the dreadful standing on the left hand of Christ, and from grievous torment, for I flee beneath thy protection, O most pure Lady. Raise me up who am beset by the darkness of sin and have fallen, O most pure one, and grant me a shower of tears whereby I may wash away my vile deeds; for thee alone do we have as a helper, O Theotokos. </p><h3>Ode III</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Let no mortal boast in his wisdom or wealth, * but rather in his faith in the Lord, * crying out to Christ God in an Orthodox manner, * ever chanting: do Thou Establish me O Master, * upon the rock of Thy commandments!  The iniquitous made holes in Thy hands and feet, O my Jesus, Who of old ineffably fashioned man by Thy hand, and Who by suffering Thy passion hast freed all from corruption, O Christ God. “Let the moon and the sun stand still!” cried Joshua, prefiguring the dimming of the heavenly lights when the Master suffered in the flesh upon the Cross, whereby the evil princes of darkness have been put to shame. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The glorious martyrs earnestly endured wounds; and, wounded, they mightily wounded the serpent Belial. Wherefore, they ever heal the wounds of our souls at the command of God. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye demolished the temples and alters of the demons, O martyrs, and by your courage and pangs most gloriously raised yourselves up through grace as temples in which the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit dwelt. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Beholding at the time of the Passion Him Who is fair in beauty bereft of comeliness and beauty, thou didst bitterly cry aloud, O pure Virgin, exclaiming: “Woe is me! How is it that Thou sufferest, O my Son, desiring to deliver all from the passions?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Thou alone knowest the weakness of human nature * and in compassion hast assumed its form; * do Thou gird me with power from on high, * that I may cry unto Thee: * Holy is the animate temple of Thine ineffable glory, O Lover of mankind! O most pure one, thou didst become a temple for Him Who reigneth over all. From the oppression of the soul-destroying thieves rescue me who have become a den for them, and show me to be the pure abode of the divine Spirit. <i class="note">Twice.</i></p><p> Send me a shower of tears which drieth up the torrents of my wicked deeds, I pray, O thou who hast given birth to Christ our God, the tranquil deep of loving-kindness, O all-hymned Virgin Theotokos. O divinely joyous and most pure Theotokos, be thou for us strength and an unshakable pillar, a shield and invincible sword, repelling the hordes of the noetic foe from us who honor thee with faith and love. </p><h3>Ode IV</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Of old, Habbakuk heard wondrous report of Thee O Christ, * and cried aloud in fear: * God shall come forth from Theman, * the Holy One from the mountain overshadowed and densely wooded, * to save His anointed ones! * Glory to Thy power, O Lord!  Stripes and wounds didst Thou endure, O Christ, healing the wounds of our hearts; and tasting bitter gall, Thou didst remove the curse of the sweet taste of corruption; and, nailed to the Tree, thou didst lift the ancient curse. Uplifted upon the Cross, Thou didst bring nigh the nations who had rejected Thee, and didst reconcile us to the Father, O Long-suffering One; and as Mediator Thou didst set Thyself between us, and in the midst of the earth didst endure a violent death. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Overwhelmed by the sea of your blood, O divinely blessed ones, the noetic Pharaoh and all his armies drowned; wherefore, saved, ye came with joy to the promised land and became citizens of heaven. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Given life by the suffering of Christ, the blessed ones were able to withstand all manner of sufferings in their honored flesh; wherefore, they cause the sufferings of souls and bodies to cease for those who ever praise and call them blessed. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Beholding Thee unjustly sacrificed, O Christ, she who gave Thee birth cried out to Thee, lamenting: “O my Son, Thou righteous Judge, how hast Thou been unjustly condemned, desiring to justify those who of old were condemned and stumbled headlong into corruption?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Perceiving thee with prophetic eyes * as the mountain overshadowed by the grace of God, * Habbakuk proclaimed that the Holy One of Israel * would come forth from thee, * for our salvation and restoration. O good one, disdain me not who am sorely diverted from the commandments of God by the lies of the demon; but have pity, I pray, and show me to be immune to his deception, O most pure one, for I flee to thy mercy. <i class="note">Twice.</i></p><p> O Christ God Who alone art merciful, through the supplications of her who gave Thee birth have mercy and take pity on those who set their hope on Thee, and guide them to the light of Thy commandments, and grant them life everlasting. By thy tireless prayers, O most pure one, rouse me who have fallen into the sleep of death, and who, weighted down by the chains of my transgressions, languish in the tomb of despair; and show me the way to repentance, I pray thee. </p><h3>Ode V</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Do Thou shine forth O Christ Thy never-waning light * upon the hearts of those who hymn Thee with faith, * granting us peace beyond understanding; * Wherefore by Thy light we flee the night of ignorance * coming unto the day, * glorifying Thee O Lover of mankind.  Beholding Thee, Who suspended the earth upon the waters, hanging naked on the Tree, O Savior, the sun stripped away its light; and when the stones felt Thee lifted up upon the rock of Golgotha, they split asunder in fear; and the foundations of the earth quaked. Uplifted upon the Tree, and run through with nails, Thou didst stain Thy fingers with blood, O Long-suffering One; and pierced by a spear in Thy side, Thou didst heal the wound of Adam, which he received when he listened to Eve, his rib, and disobeyed the One Who created her. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The multitude of the martyrs was shown to be paradise, with Christ as the Tree of life in its midst. For enduring a violent death for Him with brave resolve, they slew the serpent with divine power, who through food had brought death upon the first of our race. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With drops of blood ye dried up the abyss of ungodliness, O spiritual athletes of Christ; and with divine outpourings of sacred miracles ye overwhelm the torrents of the passions of soul and body. Wherefore, ye are rightly called blessed. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Beholding Christ uplifted of His own will, the immaculate one marveled and cried aloud, weeping: “O my Son and God, though I escaped pain in giving birth unto Thee, I now suffer pangs as Thou art crucified unjustly by the iniquitous!” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Thou hast shone upon us with the radiance * of Thy coming O Christ, * and illumined the ends of the world with Thy Cross, * enlighten with the light of thine understanding * the hearts of those who with right worship hymn Thee.  The torrents of my many transgressions have engulfed me and brought down the temple of my soul, O most pure one; but as thou art the restoration of our first parents, O Theotokos, raise me thy servant up. <i class="note">Twice.</i></p><p> Extending thy hand, O Lady, raise me up who am sinking in the mire of the passions, wretch that I am, and am foundering amid the storm of my many offenses; and guide me to the haven of repentance.

When Moses raised up his arms, he provided an image of the Passion of Thee Who stretched out Thy hands on the Tree and destroyed the pernicious dominion of the evil one; wherefore, we hymn Thee, knowing Thee to be our Redeemer and Savior, O Lover of mankind. Uplifted upon the Tree, Thou didst endure death and didst put to death him who brought death upon us; and having brought life again to the work of Thy hands, O Christ, pierced in the side with a spear Thou didst pour forth remission with both hands, O Thou Who art hymned as having two wills. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Precious in the sight of the Lord hath your memory become, O ye saints, who have honored all by your honored sufferings, and have put to shame Belial, who employeth every wile and every form of torment to cast us all down. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With all your soul ye surrendered yourselves to multifarious tortures, O all-wise ones, and ye found all the helping aid of Him Who clothed Himself in all humanity. Wherefore, as your members were severed and ye felt the fire, ye rejoiced. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Beholding Thy crucifixion, the most pure one cried aloud: “O my Son, what strange sight is this that I see? How is it that Thou, O Christ, Who healest the sufferings of the sick, dost endure new sufferings? How have Thine enemies rewarded Thee, O Benefactor, for the grace they have received?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The deepest abyss hath surrounded us, * and there is none to deliver us, * yea we have been counted as sheep for the slaughter; * save Thy people O our God, * for thou art the strength and restoration of the weak.

O most pure Virgin who hast given birth to the Bestower of life, by thy supplications bring life now to me who have been slain by the passions, and show me to be victorious over the evil foe; for thee alone do we have as a helper in the sight of God.  </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Having passed through the unbearable flame of the furnace * as though it were a bridal-chamber, * the children who for the sake of piety, * were revealed as holy * chanted together, singing the hymn: * O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!  Though Thou art Master, O my Jesus, a servant smote Thee, for Thou didst desire to free me who am held in thrall by the enemy; and, nailed to the Cross, Thou savest me who chant: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! All creation trembled, O compassionate Lord, when Thou wast crucified; and when Thy side was pierced by a spear, the enemy was wholly wounded; and Thou didst heal wounded Adam, who cried: Blessed is the God of our fathers! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Protected by the Cross, the glorious army of passion-bearers destroyed the hordes of the enemy by grace, and received crowns of victory, crying aloud: Blessed is the God of our fathers! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having acquired a will stronger than fire, O spiritual athletes, ye were cast into fire but were not consumed, utterly consuming the evil tinder of ungodliness, and crying aloud: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thine Offspring, O Virgin, most gloriously gave rise unto the ages; and, uplifted upon the Cross, with Himself He raised up the fallen and showed them to be dwellers in heaven, who cry: O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> We the faithful perceive thee, O Theotokos, * to be a noetic furnace; * for as He, the supremely exalted One, * saved the three children, * so hath He wholly refashioned fallen humanity, in thy womb, * O Thou praised and supremely glorified God of our fathers.

Of Thine own will Thou wast crucified on the Cross, O Thou Who with Thy hand unfurled the sky; and Thou wast pierced by nails, desiring to set aright the terrible stumbling of first-created Adam. Wherefore, chanting, we sing: Let all creation bless the Lord and supremely exalt Him throughout the ages! When the hard-hearted assembly lifted Thee, the Rock, up upon the rock of Golgotha, the mountains quaked and the earth shook, O Word of God; but timid souls were made steadfast in divine life, and ever cry: Let all creation bless the Lord and supremely exalt Him throughout the ages! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The holy passion-bearers manifestly wove the vesture of salvation for themselves, suffering patiently in bodily nakedness, and withstanding a heavy onslaught of wounds; wherefore, chanting, they sing: Let all creation bless the Lord and supremely exalt Him throughout the ages! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Though their nails were mercilessly torn out and their members pitilessly severed, though they were subjected to all manner of wounds, the passion-bearers did not offer sacrifice to graven images, but showed themselves to be towers of courage for the faithful, crying: Let all creation bless the Lord and supremely exalt Him throughout the ages! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “The mindless assembly, desiring to provoke Thee, considered how to remove Thee from the earth. I have become childless and am troubled, and my maternal heart is filled with pain!” she who knew not a man once cried out, as she beheld Thee nailed to the Cross.

When of old the wise thief beheld Thee, Who unfathomably suspended the earth upon the waters, hanging upon the Tree, O Savior, he cried out to Thee with faith: Remember me! And with him we piously glorify Thy sufferings. Crucified, Thou didst shake the foundations of the earth; and when Thou wast pierced by the spear, Thou didst pour forth drops of immortality: Thy Blood and water; whereby Thou didst cleanse mankind of the passions, O Jesus. Wherefore, chanting, we magnify Thee. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The valiant saints rejoiced amid their tortures, encouraging themselves as for something delightful, and crying aloud: “Let us stand firm!

<h3>Psalm 85</h3>
A prayer of David
BOW down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor, and in misery.
Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: my God, save thy servant that putteth his
trust in thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I will call daily upon thee.
Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, art good and gracious: and of great mercy unto all them that call
upon thee.
Give ear, Lord, unto my prayer: and ponder the voice of my humble desires.
In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou hearest me.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord: there is not one that can do
as thou doest.
All nations whom thou hadst made shall come and worship thee, O Lord: and
shall glorify thy Name.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in thy truth: O knit my heart unto
thee, that I may fear thy Name.
I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and will praise thy Name for
evermore.
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the
nethermost hell.
O God, the proud are risen against me: and the congregations of naughty men
have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.
But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, plenteous
in goodness and truth.
O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength unto thy
servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.
Shew some token upon me for good, that they who hate me may see it and be
ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
<h3>Psalm 86</h3>
A psalm of a song for the sons of Core
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loveth the gates of Sion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Very excellent things are spoken of thee: thou city of God.
I will think upon Rahab and Babylon: with them that know me.
Behold ye the Philistines also: and they of Tyre, with the Morians; lo, there was
he born.
And of Sion it shall be reported that he was born in her: and the most High shall
stablish her.
The Lord shall rehearse it when he writeth up the people: that he was born
there.
The singers also and trumpeters shall he rehearse: All my fresh springs shall be
in thee.
<h3>Psalm 87</h3>
A song of a psalm for the sons of Core. For the end. Upon Maeleth, for responsive strains.
Concerning instruction for Æman the Israelite
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: O let my
prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling.
For my soul is full of trouble: and my life draweth nigh unto hell.
I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit: and I have been even as a
man that hath no strength.
Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded, and lie in the grave: who
are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit: in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
Thine indignation lieth hard upon me: and thou hast vexed me with all thy
storms.
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me: and made me to be
abhorred of them.
I am so fast in prison: that I cannot get forth.
My sight faileth for very trouble: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have
stretched forth my hands unto thee.
Dost thou shew wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise up again, and
praise thee?
Shall thy loving-kindness be shewed in the grave: or thy faithfulness in
destruction?
Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy righteousness in the
land where all things are forgotten?
Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come before thee.
Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face from me?
I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die: even from my youth
up thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me: and the fear of thee hath undone me.
They came round about me daily like water: and compassed me together on
every side.
My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me: and hid mine acquaintance
out of my sight.

<h3>Psalm 88</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Ætham the Israelite
MY SONG shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the Lord: with my mouth will I
ever be shewing thy truth from one generation to another.
For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever: thy truth shalt thou stablish in the
heavens.
I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn unto David my servant;
Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne from one generation to
another.
O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and thy truth in the
congregation of the saints.
For who is he among the clouds: that shall be compared unto the Lord?
And what is he among the gods: that shall be like unto the Lord?
God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints: and to be had in
reverence of all them that are round about him.
O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee: thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on
every side.
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.
Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it: thou hast scattered thine enemies
abroad with thy mighty arm.
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast laid the foundation of
the round world, and all that therein is.
Thou hast made the north and the south: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy
Name.
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat: mercy and truth shall go
before thy face.
Blessed is the people, O Lord, that can rejoice in thee: they shall walk in the light
of thy countenance.
Their delight shall be daily in thy Name: and in thy righteousness shall they
make their boast.
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy loving-kindness thou shalt lift
up our horns.
For the Lord is our defence: the Holy One of Israel is our King.
Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help
upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
I have found David my servant: with my holy oil have I anointed him.
My hand shall hold him fast: and my arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not be able to do him violence: the son of wickedness shall not
hurt him.
I will smite down his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.
My truth also and my mercy shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be
exalted.
I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand in the floods.
He shall call me, Thou art my Father: my God, and my strong salvation.
And I will make him my first-born: higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast with
him.
His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the days of
heaven.
But if his children forsake my law: and walk not in my judgements;
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I will visit their
offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.
Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my
truth to fail.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: I
have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David.
His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the sun before me.
He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the faithful witness in
heaven.
But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed: and art displeased at him.
Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his crown to the ground.
Thou hast overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong holds.
All they that go by spoil him: and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all his adversaries to
rejoice.
Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword: and givest him not victory in the
battle.
Thou hast put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: and covered him with dishonour.
Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever: and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
O remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men for
nought?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death: and shall he deliver his soul
from the hand of hell?
Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses: which thou swarest unto David in thy
truth?
Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I do bear in my
bosom the rebukes of many people.
Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of
thine Anointed: Praised be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

<h3>Psalm 89</h3>
A prayer of Moses the man of God
LORD, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of
men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a
watch in the night.
As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut down,
dried up and withered.
For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance.
For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our years to an end, as
it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong
that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but labour and
sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.
But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man feareth,
so is thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be glad all the
days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us: and for the years
wherein we have suffered adversity.
Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou the work
of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handywork.
<h3>Psalm 90</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the most High: shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty..
I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my strong hold: my God, in him
will I trust.
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome
pestilence.
He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers:
his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by
day;
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness that destroyeth
in the noon-day.
A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall
not come nigh thee.
Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold: and see the reward of the ungodly.
For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of defence very high.
There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou
tread under thy feet.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him
up, because he hath known my Name.
He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble; I will
deliver him, and bring him to honour.
With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation.

         </p><h3>THE READING IS FROM ISAIAH </h3><p>Thus saith the Lord: Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people  be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them  bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: our let them hear, and say, It is  truth. Ye (are) my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen:  that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I (am) he: before me there was  no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the LORD; and beside  me there is no savior. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there  was) no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that  I am God. Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of  my hand: I will work, and who shall let it? Thus saith the LORD, your Redeemer, the  Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all  their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. Thus saith the Lord. The  Holy One of Israel </p><h3>THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON </h3><p>The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God, and there shall no torment  touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die, and their departure is  taken for misery, and their going from us to be utter destruction, but they are in  peace. For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of  immortality. And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded, for  God proved them and found them worthy for Himself. As gold in the furnace hath  He tried them, and received them as a burnt offering. And in the time of their  visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. They  shall judge the nations and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign  for ever. They that put their trust in Him shall understand the truth; and such as be  faithful in love shall abide with Him; for grace and mercy is to His saints and  visitation for His elect.  </p><h3>THE READING FROM THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON </h3><p>Though the righteous man happen to die, yet shall he rest in peace. For honorable  age is not that which is so for a length of time, nor that which is measured by the  number of years. But wisdom and a spotless life to a ripe old age is the true gray hair  of a man. He pleased God, and was beloved of Him, so that living among sinners he  was taken away. Yea, speedily was he taken up, lest wickedness should pervert his  understanding, or deceit beguile his soul. For the beguilement of transgression doth  obscure things that are good, and the wanderings of lust doth undermine the  innocent mind. Made perfect in a short time, he fulfilled many years; for his soul  pleased the Lord; therefore the Lord hastened to take him away from among the  wicked. This the people saw, and did not understand, neither did they lay this up in  their hearts, that grace and mercy is with His saints, and that the Lord doth visit His  chosen ones.

<h3>Psalm 91</h3>
A psalm of a song for the Sabbath-day
IT IS a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy
Name, O most Highest.
To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning: and of thy truth in the nightseason.
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute: upon a loud instrument,
and upon the harp.
For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works: and I will rejoice in giving
praise for the operations of thy hands.
O Lord, how glorious are thy works: thy thoughts are very deep.
An unwise man doth not well consider this: and a fool doth not understand it.
When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish: then shall they be destroyed for ever; but thou,
Lord, art the most Highest for evermore.
For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, lo, thine enemies shall perish: and all the workers
of wickedness shall be destroyed.
But mine horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn: for I am anointed with
fresh oil.
Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies: and mine ear shall hear his
desire of the wicked that arise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar
in Libanus.
Such as are planted in the house of the Lord: shall flourish in the courts of the
house of our God.
They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age: and shall be fat and wellliking.
That they may shew how true the Lord my strength is: and that there is no
unrighteousness in him.
<h3>Psalm 92</h3>
For the day before the Sabbath. When the land was first inhabited, the praise of a song by David
THE Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his
apparel, and girded himself with strength.
He hath made the round world so sure: that it cannot be moved.
Ever since the world began hath thy seat been prepared: thou art from
everlasting.
The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lift up their voice: the floods lift up
their waves.
The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly: but yet the Lord, who
dwelleth on high, is mightier.
Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becometh thine house for ever.
<h3>Psalm 93</h3>
A psalm of David for the fourth day of the week
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth: thou God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself.
Arise, thou Judge of the world: and reward the proud after their deserving.
Lord, how long shall the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly triumph?
How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully: and make such proud
boasting?
They smite down thy people, O Lord: and trouble thine heritage.
They murder the widow and the stranger: and put the fatherless to death.
And yet they say, Tush, the Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob
regard it.
Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the eye, shall he not
see?
Or he that nurtureth the heathen: it is he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not
he punish?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man: that they are but vain.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him in thy law.
That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity: until the pit be digged
up for the ungodly.
For the Lord will not fail his people: neither will he forsake his inheritance;
Until righteousness turn again unto judgement: all such as are true in heart shall
follow it.
Who will rise up with me against the wicked: or who will take my part against
the evil-doers?
If the Lord had not helped me: it had not failed but my soul had been put to
silence.
But when I said, My foot hath slipt: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.
In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart: thy comforts have
refreshed my soul.
Wilt thou have any thing to do with the stool of wickedness: which imagineth
mischief as a law?
They gather them together against the soul of the righteous: and condemn the
innocent blood.
But the Lord is my refuge: and my God is the strength of my confidence.
He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own
malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

<h3>Psalm 94</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
O COME, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our
salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: and shew ourselves glad in
him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God: and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hills is his
also.
The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep
of his hand.
To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the provocation,
and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: It is a people that
do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways;
Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.
<h3>Psalm 95</h3>
When the house was built after the captivity. A song by David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the whole earth.
Sing unto the Lord, and praise his Name: be telling of his salvation from day to
day.
Declare his honour unto the heathen: and his wonders unto all people.
For the Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised: he is more to be feared
than all gods.
As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols: but it is the Lord that made
the heavens.
Glory and worship are before him: power and honour are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people: ascribe unto the Lord
worship and power.
Ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his Name: bring presents, and come
into his courts.
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let the whole earth stand in awe of
him.
Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King: and that it is he who hath
made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; and how that he
shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea make a noise, and
all that therein is.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood
rejoice before the Lord.
For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: and with righteousness to judge
the world, and the people with his truth.
<h3>Psalm 96</h3>
For David, when his land is established
THE Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
may be glad thereof.
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgement are the
habitation of his seat.
There shall go a fire before him: and burn up his enemies on every side.
His lightnings gave shine unto the world: the earth saw it, and was afraid.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord
of the whole earth.
The heavens have declared his righteousness: and all the people have seen his
glory.
Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in vain
gods: worship him, all ye gods.
Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad, because of
thy judgements, O Lord.
For thou, Lord, art higher than all that are in the earth: thou art exalted far
above all gods.
O ye that love the Lord, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: the Lord
preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of
the ungodly.
There is sprung up a light for the righteous: and the joyful gladness for such as
are true-hearted.
Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous: and give thanks for a remembrance of his
holiness.

<h3>Psalm 97</h3>
A Psalm of David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous things.
With his own right hand, and with his holy arm: hath he gotten himself the
victory.
The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the
sight of the heathen.
He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel: and all the
ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.
Shew yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing, rejoice, and give thanks.
Praise the Lord upon the harp: sing to the harp with a psalm of thanksgiving.
With trumpets also and shawms: O shew yourselves joyful before the Lord the
King.
Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round world, and they that
dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together before the
Lord: for he is come to judge the earth.
With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with equity.
<h3>Psalm 98</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord is King, be the people never so unpatient: he sitteth between the
cherubims, be the earth never so unquiet.
The Lord is great in Sion: and high above all people.
They shall give thanks unto thy Name: which is great, wonderful, and holy.
The King's power loveth judgement; thou hast prepared equity: thou hast
executed judgement and righteousness in Jacob.
O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before his footstool, for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call upon his
Name: these called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar: for they kept his testimonies, and
the law that he gave them.
Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou forgavest them, O God, and
punishedst their own inventions.
O magnify the Lord our God, and worship him upon his holy hill: for the Lord our
God is holy.
<h3>Psalm 99</h3>
A psalm for thanksgiving
O BE joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come
before his presence with a song.
Be ye sure that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we
ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:
be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.
For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting: and his truth endureth from
generation to generation.
<h3>Psalm 100</h3>
A Psalm of David
MY SONG shall be of mercy and judgement: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.
O let me have understanding: in the way of godliness.
When wilt thou come unto me: I will walk in my house with a perfect heart.
I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of unfaithfulness: there shall
no such cleave unto me.
A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour: him will I destroy.
Whoso hath also a proud look and high stomach: I will not suffer him.
Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land: that they may dwell with
me.
Whoso leadeth a godly life: he shall be my servant.
There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house: he that telleth lies shall not
tarry in my sight.
I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land: that I may root out all
wicked doers from the city of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 101</h3>
A prayer for the poor, when he is deeply afflicted and pours out his supplication before the Lord
HEAR my prayer, O Lord: and let my crying come unto thee.
Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine ear unto me
when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.
For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt up as it
were a firebrand.
My heart is smitten down, and withered liked grass: so that I forget to eat my
bread.
For the voice of my groaning: my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.
I am become like a pelican in the wilderness: and like an owl that is in the desert.
I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that sitteth alone upon the
house-top.
Mine enemies revile me all the day long: and they that are mad upon me are
sworn together against me.
For I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping.
And that because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and
cast me down.
My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.
But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever: and thy remembrance throughout all
generations.
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that thou have mercy
upon her, yea, the time is come.
And why? thy servants think upon her stones: and it pitieth them to see her in
the dust.
The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy
majesty;
When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall appear;
When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute: and despiseth not
their desire.
This shall be written for those that come after: and the people which shall be
born shall praise the Lord.
For he hath looked down from his sanctuary: out of the heaven did the Lord
behold the earth;
That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity: and deliver the
children appointed unto death;
That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion: and his worship at
Jerusalem;
When the people are gathered together: and the kingdoms also, to serve the
Lord.
He brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.
But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age: as for thy
years, they endure throughout all generations.
Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax old as doth a
garment;
And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art
the same, and thy years shall not fail.
The children of thy servants shall continue: and their seed shall stand fast in thy
sight.
<h3>Psalm 102</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me praise his holy Name.
Praise the Lord, O my soul: and forget not all his benefits;
Who forgiveth all thy sin: and healeth all thine infirmities;
Who saveth thy life from destruction: and crowneth thee with mercy and lovingkindness;
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: making thee young and lusty as an
eagle.
The Lord executeth righteousness and judgement: for all them that are
oppressed with wrong.
He shewed his ways unto Moses: his works unto the children of Israel.
The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and of great goodness.
He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth he his anger for ever.
He hath not dealt with us after our sins: nor rewarded us according to our
wickednesses.
For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth: so great is his mercy
also toward them that fear him.
Look how wide also the east is from the west: so far hath he set our sins from us.
Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children: even so is the Lord merciful unto
them that fear him.
For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that we are but dust.
The days of man are but as grass: for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.
For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone: and the place thereof shall know
it no more.
But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon them that
fear him: and his righteousness upon children's children;
Even upon such as keep his covenant: and think upon his commandments to do
them.
The Lord hath prepared his seat in heaven: and his kingdom ruleth over all.
O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength: ye that fulfil his
commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words.
O praise the Lord, all ye his hosts: ye servants of his that do his pleasure.
O speak good of the Lord, all ye works of his, in all places of his dominion: praise
thou the Lord, O my soul.

<h3>Psalm 103</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art become exceeding
glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.
Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment: and spreadest out the
heavens like a curtain.
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: and maketh the clouds his
chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.
He maketh his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire.
He laid the foundations of the earth: that it never should move at any time.
Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment: the waters stand in the
hills.
At thy rebuke they flee: at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.
They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath: even unto the
place which thou hast appointed for them.
Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass: neither turn again to
cover the earth.
He sendeth the springs into the rivers: which run among the hills.
All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild asses quench their thirst.
Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation: and sing among the
branches.
He watereth the hills from above: the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
He bringeth forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the service of men;
That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of
man: and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen
man's heart.
The trees of the Lord also are full of sap: even the cedars of Libanus which he
hath planted;
Wherein the birds make their nests: and the fir-trees are a dwelling for the stork.
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats: and so are the stony rocks for the
conies.
He appointed the moon for certain seasons: and the sun knoweth his going down.
Thou makest darkness that it may be night: wherein all the beasts of the forest
do move.
The lions roaring after their prey: do seek their meat from God.
The sun ariseth, and they get them away together: and lay them down in their
dens.
Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour: until the evening.
O Lord, how manifold are thy works: in wisdom hast thou made them all; the
earth is full of thy riches.
So is the great and wide sea also: wherein are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great beasts.
There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan: whom thou hast made to take his
pastime therein.
These wait all upon thee: that thou mayest give them meat in due season.
When thou givest it them they gather it: and when thou openest thy hand they
are filled with good.
When thou hidest thy face they are troubled: when thou takest away their breath
they die, and are turned again to their dust.
When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made: and thou shalt renew
the face of the earth.
The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in
his works.
The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch the hills, they shall
smoke.
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will praise my God while I have my
being.
And so shall my words please him: my joy shall be in the Lord.
As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall
come to an end: praise thou the Lord, O my soul, praise the Lord.

Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his Name: tell the people what
things he hath done.
O let your songs be of him, and praise him: and let your talking be of all his
wondrous works.
Rejoice in his holy Name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek the Lord and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Remember the marvellous works that he hath done: his wonders, and the
judgements of his mouth.
O ye seed of Abraham his servant: ye children of Jacob his chosen.
He is the Lord our God: his judgements are in all the world.
He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise: that he made to a
thousand generations;
Even the covenant that he made with Abraham: and the oath that he sware unto
Isaac;
And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law: and to Israel for an everlasting
testament;
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan: the lot of your inheritance;
When there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in the land;
What time as they went from one nation to another: from one kingdom to another
people;
He suffered no man to do them wrong: but reproved even kings for their sakes;
Touch not mine Anointed: and do my prophets no harm.
Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land: and destroyed all the provision of
bread.
But he had sent a man before them: even Joseph, who was sold to be a bondservant;
Whose feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his soul;
Until the time came that his cause was known: the word of the Lord tried him.
The king sent, and delivered him: the prince of the people let him go free.
He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his substance;
That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach his senators wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people exceedingly: and made them stronger than their
enemies.
Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people: and dealt untruly with his
servants.
Then sent he Moses his servant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.
And these shewed his tokens among them: and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and it was dark: and they were not obedient unto his word.
He turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs: yea, even in their kings' chambers.
He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies: and lice in all their
quarters.
He gave them hail-stones for rain: and flames of fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and fig-trees: and destroyed the trees that were in
their coasts.
He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable:
and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their
ground.
He smote all the first-born in their land: even the chief of all their strength.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person
among their tribes.
Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were afraid of them.
He spread out a cloud to be a covering: and fire to give light in the night-season.
At their desire he brought quails: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in the
dry places.
For why? he remembered his holy promise: and Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy: and his chosen with gladness.
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people
in possession;
That they might keep his statutes: and observe his laws.

        <h3>   THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. LUKE, (12, 2-12).  </h3><p>The Lord said, there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid,  that shall not be known. Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be  heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be  proclaimed upon the housetops. And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of  them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will  forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to  cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. Are not five sparrows sold for two  farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? But even the very hairs of  your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many  sparrows. Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the  Son of man also confess before the Angels of God: But he that denieth me before  men shall be denied before the Angels of God. And whosoever shall speak a word  against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth  against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven. And when they bring you unto the  synagogues, and (unto) </h3><p>magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what  thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the  same hour what ye ought to say.  </p>

        <h3>THE SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY (2:1-10)</h3><p>Brethren: Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things that thou 
hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who 
shall be able to teach others also. Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier 
of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; 
that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. And if a man also strive 
for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. The husbandman that 
laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. Consider what I say; and the Lord give 
thee understanding in all things. Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David 
was raised from the dead according to my gospel: Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil 
doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. Therefore I endure all 
things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ 
Jesus with eternal Glory ..., 
</p><p><i class="note">Alleluia, in Tone IV:</i> The righteous man shall flourish like a palm-tree; like a 
cedar in Lebanon shall he be multiplied. 
</p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> They that are planted in the house of the Lord, in the courts of our 
God shall they blossom forth. 
<h3>THE HOLY GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. JOHN (15:17- 16:2)</h3><p>The Lord said unto His disciples: These things I command you, that ye love one 
another. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye 
were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, 
but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember 
the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have 
persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will 
keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, 
because they know not him that sent me. If I had not come and spoken unto them, 
they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin. He that hateth me 
hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them the works which none other 
man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and 
my Father. But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in 
their law, They hated me without a cause. But when the Comforter is come, whom I 
will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from 
the Father, he shall testify of me: 27 And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have 
been with me from the beginning. These things have I spoken unto you, that ye 
should not be offended. They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time 
cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.

<h3>Psalm 105</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for
ever.
Who can express the noble acts of the Lord: or shew forth all his praise?
Blessed are they that alway keep judgement: and do righteousness.
Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation;
That I may see the felicity of thy chosen: and rejoice in the gladness of thy
people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers: we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly.
Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great
goodness in remembrance: but were disobedient at the sea, even at the
Red sea.
Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake: that he might make his power
to be known.
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the
deep, as through a wilderness.
And he saved them from the adversaries' hand: and delivered them from the
hand of the enemy.
As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them: there was not
one of them left.
Then believed they his words: and sang praise unto him.
But within a while they forgat his works: and would not abide his counsel.
But lust came upon them in the wilderness: and they tempted God in the desert.
And he gave them their desire: and sent leanness withal into their soul.
They angered Moses also in the tents: and Aaron the saint of the Lord.
So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of
Abiram.
And the fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the ungodly.
They made a calf in Horeb: and worshipped the molten image.
Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.
And they forgat God their Saviour: who had done so great things in Egypt;
Wondrous works in the land of Ham: and fearful things by the Red sea.
So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood
before him in the gap: to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should
destroy them.
Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no credence unto his
word;
But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord.
Then lift he up his hand against them: to overthrow them in the wilderness;
To cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves unto Baal-peor: and ate the offerings of the dead.
Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions: and the plague was
great among them.
Then stood up Phinees and prayed: and so the plague ceased.
And that was counted unto him for righteousness: among all posterities for
evermore.
They angered him also at the waters of strife: so that he punished Moses for
their sakes;
Because they provoked his spirit: so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Neither destroyed they the heathen: as the Lord commanded them;
But were mingled among the heathen: and learned their works.
Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay: yea,
they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters:
whom they had offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled
with blood.
Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring with their own
inventions.
Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people: insomuch that
he abhorred his own inheritance.
And he gave them over into the hands of the heathen: and they that hated them
were lords over them.
Their enemies oppressed them: and had them in subjection.
Many a time did he deliver them: but they rebelled against him with their own
inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.
Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity: he heard their complaint.
He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude of
his mercies: yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity
them.
Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen: that we may
give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world without end: and
let all the people say, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 106</h3>
Alleluia
Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed: and delivered from the
hand of the enemy;
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west: from the
north and from the south.
They went astray in the wilderness out of the way: and found no city to dwell in;
Hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.
So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: and he delivered them from their
distress.
He led them forth by the right way: that they might go to the city where they
dwelt.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he satisfieth the empty soul: and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: being fast bound in misery
and iron ;
Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly regarded the
counsel of the most Highest;
He also brought down their heart through heaviness: they fell down, and there
was none to help them.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death: and brake
their bonds in sunder.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he hath broken the gates of brass: and smitten the bars of iron in sunder.
Foolish men are plagued for their offence: and because of their wickedness.
Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they were even hard at death's door.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
He sent his word, and healed them: and they were saved from their destruction.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving: and tell out his
works with gladness!
They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their business in great waters;
These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.
For at his word the stormy wind ariseth: which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep: their soul
melteth away because of the trouble.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are at their wits' end.
So when thy cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivereth them out of their
distress.
For he maketh the storm to cease: so that the waves thereof are still.
Then are they glad, because they are at rest: and so he bringeth them unto the
haven where they would be.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people: and praise him
in the seat of the elders!
Who turneth the floods into a wilderness: and drieth up the water-springs.
A fruitful land maketh he barren: for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water: and water-springs of a dry
ground.
And there he setteth the hungry: that they may build them a city to dwell in.
That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards: to yield them fruits of
increase.
He blesseth them so that they multiply exceedingly: and suffereth not their cattle
to decrease.
And again, when they are minished and brought low: through oppression,
through any plague or trouble;
Though he suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants: and let them wander
out of the way in the wilderness.
Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery: and maketh him households like a flock of
sheep.
The righteous will consider this, and rejoice: and the mouth of all wickedness
shall be stopped.
Whoso is wise will ponder these things: and they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 107</h3>
Song of a psalm by David
O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing and give praise with the
best member that I have.
Awake, thou lute, and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing praises unto
thee among the nations.
For thy mercy is greater than the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
That thy beloved may be delivered: let thy right hand save them, and hear thou
me.
God hath spoken in his holiness: I will rejoice therefore, and divide Sichem, and
mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head.
Judah is my law-giver, Moab is my wash-pot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe,
upon Philistia will I triumph.
Who will lead me into the strong city: and who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou forsaken us, O God: and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our
hosts?
O help us against the enemy: for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do great acts: and it is he that shall tread down our
enemies.
<h3>Psalm 108</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise: for the mouth of the ungodly, yea, the
mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.
And they have spoken against me with false tongues: they compassed me about
also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part: but I give
myself unto prayer.
Thus have they rewarded me evil for good: and hatred for my good will.
Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand.
When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned: and let his prayer be
turned into sin.
Let his days be few: and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless: and his wife a widow.
Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread: let them seek it also out of
desolate places.
Let the extortioner consume all that he hath: and let the stranger spoil his
labour.
Let there be no man to pity him: nor to have compassion upon his fatherless
children.
Let his posterity be destroyed: and in the next generation let his name be clean
put out.
Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight of the Lord:
and let not the sin of his mother be done away.
Let them alway be before the Lord: that he may root out the memorial of them
from off the earth.
And that, because his mind was not to do good: but persecuted the poor helpless
man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.
His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him: he loved not blessing,
therefore shall it be far from him.
He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a raiment: and it shall come into his
bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be unto him as the cloke that he hath upon him: and as the girdle that he is
alway girded withal.
Let it thus happen from the Lord unto mine enemies: and to those that speak evil
against my soul.
But deal thou with me, O Lord God, according unto thy Name: for sweet is thy
mercy.
O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor: and my heart is wounded within me.
I go hence like the shadow that departeth: and am driven away as the
grasshopper.
My knees are weak through fasting: my flesh is dried up for want of fatness.
I became also a reproach unto them: they that looked upon me shaked their
heads.
Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy.
And they shall know, how that this is thy hand: and that thou, Lord, hast done it.
Though they curse, yet bless thou: and let them be confounded that rise up
against me; but let thy servant rejoice.
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame: and let them cover themselves with
their own confusion, as with a cloke.
As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth: and praise him
among the multitude.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor: to save his soul from the
unrighteous judges.

<h3>Psalm 134</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, laud ye the Name of the Lord: praise it, O ye servants of the
Lord;
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord: in the courts of the house of our God.
O praise the Lord, for the Lord is gracious: O sing praises unto his Name, for it is
lovely.
For why? the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself: and Israel for his own
possession.
For I know that the Lord is great: and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth: and in the sea,
and in all deep places.
He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world: and sendeth forth
lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his treasures.
He smote the first-born of Egypt: both of man and beast.
He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of Egypt:
upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.
He smote divers nations: and slew mighty kings;
Sehon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Basan: and all the kingdoms of
Canaan;
And gave their land to be an heritage: even an heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever: so doth thy memorial, O Lord, from one
generation to another.
For the Lord will avenge his people: and be gracious unto his servants.
As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold: the work of men's
hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, but they see not.
They have ears, and yet they hear not: neither is there any breath in their
mouths.
They that make them are like unto them: and so are all they that put their trust
in them.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Israel: praise the Lord, ye house of Aaron.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, praise the Lord.
Praised be the Lord out of Sion: who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
<h3>Psalm 135</h3>
Alleluia
O give thanks unto the God of all gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O thank the Lord of all lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who only doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who by his excellent wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who laid out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who hath made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The sun to rule the day: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The moon and the stars to govern the night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote Egypt with their first-born: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever;
With a mighty hand, and stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who divided the Red sea in two parts: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And made Israel to go through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever.
But as for Pharaoh and his host, he overthrew them in the Red sea: for his mercy
endureth for ever.
Who led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Yea, and slew mighty kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Sehon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And Og the king of Basan: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And gave away their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Even for an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who remembered us when we were in trouble: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And hath delivered us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 136</h3>
For David. A psalm of Jeremias
BY THE waters of Babylon we sat down and wept: when we remembered thee, O
Sion.
As for our harps, we hanged them up: upon the trees that are therein.
For they that led us away captive required of us then a song, and melody in our
heaviness: Sing us one of the songs of Sion.
How shall we sing the Lord's song: in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem: let my right hand forget her cunning.
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: yea, if I
prefer not Jerusalem in my mirth.
Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem: how they said,
Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.
O daughter of Babylon , wasted with misery: yea, happy shall he be that
rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us.
Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children: and throweth them against the
stones.

<h3>Psalm 137</h3>
A psalm of David, of Aggæus and Zacharias
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: even before the gods
will I sing praise unto thee.
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of thy
loving-kindness and truth: for thou hast magnified thy Name and thy word
above all things.
When I called upon thee, thou heardest me: and enduedst my soul with much
strength.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they have heard the words
of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: that great is the glory of the Lord.
For though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: as for the
proud, he beholdeth them afar off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me: thou shalt
stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy right
hand shall save me.
The lord shall make good his loving-kindness toward me: yea, thy mercy, O Lord,
endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine own hands.
<h3>Psalm 138</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
O LORD, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou knowest my downsitting and mine up-rising, thou understandest my thoughts long before.
Thou art about my path, and about my bed: and spiest out all my ways.
For lo, there is not a word in my tongue: but thou, O Lord, knowest it altogether.
Thou hast fashioned me behind and before: and laid thine hand upon me.
Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me: I cannot attain unto it.
Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit: or whither shall I go then from thy
presence?
If I climb up into heaven, thou art there: if I go down to hell, thou art there also.
If I take the wings of the morning: and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me.
If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall my night be turned
to day.
Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day:
the darkness and light to thee are both alike.
For my reins are thine: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous
are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.
My bones are not hid from thee: though I be made secretly, and fashioned
beneath in the earth.
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect: and in thy book were all
my members written;
Which day by day were fashioned: when as yet there was none of them.
How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God: O how great is the sum of them!
If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: when I wake up I am
present with thee.
Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God: depart from me, ye blood-thirsty men.
For they speak unrighteously against thee: and thine enemies take thy Name in
vain.
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee: and am not I grieved with those that
rise up against thee?
Yea, I hate them right sore: even as though they were mine enemies.
Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart: prove me, and examine my
thoughts.
Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me: and lead me in the way
everlasting.
<h3>Psalm 139</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
DELIVER me, O Lord, from the evil man: and preserve me from the wicked man.
Who imagine mischief in their hearts: and stir up strife all the day long.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: adders' poison is under their
lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly: preserve me from the wicked
men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.
The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with cords: yea, and
set traps in my way.
I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my prayers, O Lord.
O Lord God, thou strength of my health: thou hast covered my head in the day of
the battle.
Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord: let not his mischievous imagination
prosper, lest they be too proud.
Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them: that compass me
about.
Let hot burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire and into the
pit, that they never rise up again.
A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: evil shall hunt the wicked
person to overthrow him.
Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor: and maintain the cause of the
helpless.
The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name: and the just shall continue in
thy sight.

<h3>Psalm 140</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, I call upon thee, haste thee unto me: and consider my voice when I cry
unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense: and let the lifting up of my
hands be an evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and keep the door of my lips.
O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing: let me not be occupied in
ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, lest I eat of such things
as please them.
Let the righteous rather smite me friendly: and reprove me.
But let not their precious balms break my head: yea, I will pray yet against their
wickedness.
Let their judges be overthrown in stony places: that they may hear my words, for
they are sweet.
Our bones lie scattered before the pit: like as when one breaketh and heweth
wood upon the earth.
But mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust , O cast not out my
soul.
Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me: and from the traps of the
wicked doers.
Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together: and let me ever escape them.
<h3>Psalm 141</h3>
A psalm of instruction for David. When he was in the cave; a prayer
I CRIED unto the Lord with my voice: yea, even unto the Lord did I make my
supplication.
I poured out my complaints before him: and shewed him of my trouble.
When my spirit was in heaviness thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I
walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
I looked also upon my right hand: and saw there was no man that would know
me.
I had no place to flee unto: and no man cared for my soul.
I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said: Thou art my hope, and my portion in the land
of the living.
Consider my complaint: for I am brought very low.
O deliver me from my persecutors: for they are too strong for me.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name: which thing if
thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto my company.
<h3>Psalm 142</h3>
A psalm of David when his son pursued him
HEAR my prayer, O Lord, and consider my desire: hearken unto me for thy truth
and righteousness' sake.
And enter not into judgement with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
living be justified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the
ground: he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have been long
dead.
Therefore is my spirit vexed within me: and my heart within me is desolate.
Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works: yea, I exercise
myself in the works of thy hands.
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.
Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint: hide not thy face from
me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for in thee is my trust:
shew thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I flee unto thee to hide me.
Teach me to do a thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God: let thy loving
Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.
Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name's sake: and for thy righteousness' sake bring
my soul out of trouble.
And of thy goodness slay mine enemies: and destroy all them that vex my soul ;
for I am thy servant.

<h3>Psalm 143</h3>
A psalm of David concerning Goliath
BLESSED be the Lord my strength: who teacheth my hands to war, and my
fingers to fight.
My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in whom I trust:
who subdueth my people that is under me.
Lord, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him: or the son of man, that
thou so regardest him?
Man is like a thing of nought: his time passeth away like a shadow.
Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall
smoke.
Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them: shoot out thine arrows, and consume
them.
Send down thine hand from above: deliver me, and take me out of the great
waters, from the hand of strange children.
Whose mouth talketh of vanity: and their right hand is a right hand of
wickedness.
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: and sing praises unto thee upon a tenstringed lute.
Thou hast given victory unto kings: and hast delivered David thy servant from
the peril of the sword.
Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children: whose mouth talketh
of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.
That our sons may grow up as the young plants: and that our daughters may be
as the polished corners of the temple.
That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of store: that our
sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets.
That our oxen may be strong to labour, that there be no decay: no leading into
captivity, and no complaining in our streets.
Happy are the people that are in such a case: yea, blessed are the people who
have the Lord for their God.
<h3>Psalm 144</h3>
David's Psalm of praise
I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King: and I will praise thy Name for ever and
ever.
Every day will I give thanks unto thee: and praise thy Name for ever and ever.
Great is the Lord, and marvellous worthy to be praised: there is no end of his
greatness.
One generation shall praise thy works unto another: and declare thy power.
As for me, I will be talking of thy worship: thy glory, thy praise, and wondrous
works;
So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts: and I will also tell of
thy greatness.
The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be shewed: and men shall sing of
thy righteousness.
The Lord is gracious and merciful: long-suffering and of great goodness.
The Lord is loving unto every man: and his mercy is over all his works.
All thy works praise thee, O Lord: and thy saints give thanks unto thee.
They shew the glory of thy kingdom: and talk of thy power;
That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom: might be known unto
men.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom: and thy dominion endureth throughout
all ages.
The Lord upholdeth all such as fall: and lifteth up all those that are down.
The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord: and thou givest them their meat in due
season.
Thou openest thine hand: and fillest all things living with plenteousness.
The Lord is righteous in all his ways: and holy in all his works.
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: yea, all such as call upon him
faithfully.
He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will
help them.
The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but scattereth abroad all the
ungodly.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh give thanks unto his
holy Name for ever and ever.

<h3>Psalm 145</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul; while I live will I praise the Lord: yea, as long as I
have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.
O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man: for there is no help in
them.
For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn again to his earth: and then
all his thoughts perish.
Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help: and whose hope is in the
Lord his God;
Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: who keepeth his
promise for ever;
Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong: who feedeth the hungry.
The Lord looseth men out of prison: the Lord giveth sight to the blind.
The Lord helpeth them that are fallen: the Lord careth for the righteous.
The Lord careth for the strangers, he defendeth the fatherless and widow :as for
the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.
The Lord thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore: and throughout all
generations.
<h3>Psalm 146</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God: yea, a
joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: and gather together the out-casts of Israel.
He healeth those that are broken in heart: and giveth medicine to heal their
sickness.
He telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and great is his power: yea, and his wisdom is infinite.
The Lord setteth up the meek: and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground.
O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving: sing praises upon the harp unto our God;
Who covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth: and
maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men;
Who giveth fodder unto the cattle: and feedeth the young ravens that call upon
him.
He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse: neither delighteth he in any
man's legs.
But the Lord's delight is in them that fear him: and put their trust in his mercy.
<h3>Psalm 147</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.
For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates: and hath blessed thy children within
thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: and his word runneth very
swiftly.
He giveth snow like wool: and scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who is able to abide his frost?
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he bloweth with his wind, and the
waters flow.
He sheweth his word unto Jacob: his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with any nation: neither have the heathen knowledge of his
laws.

Praise him, all ye heavens: and ye waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the Name of the Lord: for he spake the word, and they were
made; he commanded, and they were created.
He hath made them fast for ever and ever: he hath given them a law which shall
not be broken.
Praise the Lord upon earth: ye dragons, and all deeps;
Fire and hail, snow and vapours: wind and storm, fulfilling his word;
Mountains and all hills: fruitful trees and all cedars;
Beasts and all cattle: worms and feathered fowls;
Kings of the earth and all people: princes and all judges of the world;
Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of the Lord: for
his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven and earth.
He shalt exalt the horn of his people; all his saints shall praise him: even the
children of Israel, even the people the serveth him.

O SING unto the Lord a new song: let the congregation of saints praise him.
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: and let the children of Sion be joyful in

Let them praise his Name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with
tabret and harp.
For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: and helpeth the meek-hearted.
Let the saints be joyful with glory: let them rejoice in their beds.
Let the praises of God be in their mouth: and a two-edged sword in their hands;
To be avenged of the heathen: and to rebuke the people;
To bind their kings in chains: and their nobles with links of iron.
That they may be avenged of them, as it is written: Such honour have all his
saints.
<h3>Psalm 150</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE God in his holiness: praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him in his noble acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.
Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: praise him upon the lute and harp.
Praise him in the cymbals and dances: praise him upon the strings and pipe.
Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: praise him upon the loud cymbals.
Let every thing that hath breath: praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 151</h3>
This psalm is ascribed to David and is outside the number. When he slew Goliath in single
combat.
LITTLE was I among my brethren: a younger brother in my father’s house.
My hands, they made an instrument of music: my fingers, they prepared a
psaltery.
And who shall bring back tidings to my master? The Lord himself, himself gives
ear.
Himself sent forth his messenger: and took me from among my father’s sheep;
and with the oil of his anointing He anointed me.
Comely my brethren were and tall: and yet they found not favor with the Lord.
But I, I sallied forth to meet the alien: and he reviled me by all his idols.
But I drew forth the sword that was beside him: I cut his head off with it, and
from the sons of Israel removed reproach.</div>

O Word Who art dispassionate by nature, yet didst endure sufferings for our sake and wast crucified with thieves, Thou didst slay the serpent, the author of evil, saving those who worship Thee. Though Thou art the dawning of the East, O Jesus, Thou didst come to the parts of the West, our rejected nature; and the sun, seeing Thee crucified, hid its light. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Trading well a temporal death for life everlasting, O glorious spiritual athletes, ye were deemed worthy of the kingdom of heaven; wherefore, ye are glorified and called blessed. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O ye who valiantly emulated the sufferings of Christ, ye cure the sufferings of those on earth with a mystic therapy, O holy martyrs, and drive away evil spirits by your words. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> When the Ewe-lamb beheld Christ the Lamb lifted up upon the Cross, she exclaimed, crying aloud: “Whither hath Thy beauty set, O long-suffering Son Who art without beginning?” </p><p><i class="note">Another canon, of the Most Holy Theotokos, in Tone I: </p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i></i> Let us all chant a triumphant hymn unto God * Who wrought wondrous miracles * with His upraised arm, * and saved Israel, * for He hath been glorified.  In that thou hast given birth in time to the only timeless God, Who became incarnate, O all-holy and most pure one, heal thou the chronic passions of mine all-accursed soul. As thou art merciful, O most pure one, by thy supplications do away with the wounds of my soul, the perversity of my heart, the darkening of my thoughts and the turning away of my mind. O most pure one, who hast given birth to the Light, my Redeemer, deliver me from everlasting torments, that, saved, I may hymn thy tender compassion. I am engulfed in the abyss of evils and the tumult of the passions, yet I call upon thy tranquility, O most pure one: Save me, for thou art the haven of the faithful! </p><h3>Ode III</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Let my heart be established in Thy will O Christ God, * Who hath established a second heaven over the waters, * and founded the earth upon the waters, * O all-powerful One. Thou didst stretch out Thy hands upon the Cross, staining Thy divine fingers with blood, and delivering Adam, the work of Thy hands, O Master, from the hands of the slayer, in that Thou alone art good and the Lover of mankind. Thou wast lifted up upon the Tree and wast pierced in the side by a spear, O Master, setting aright the fall caused by Eve, Adam’s rib, whom of old misfortune befell through the fruit of the tree; and thou didst lead them into paradise with the honest thief. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With pure minds and chanting let us hymn the martyrs of the Lord: the confirmation of the Church, the rampart and towers of piety, the destroyers of the enemy. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> As divine branches of the noetic Vine, the martyrs manifestly produced for us the grapes which pour forth the wine which gladdeneth the hearts of all the faithful. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Through His Cross, the blessed Fruit of thy womb O all-hymned Virgin, hath made those corrupted by the fruit of the tree partakers of incorruption, for the sake of His Cross. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Let my heart be established in Thy will O Christ God, * Who hath established a second heaven over the waters, * and founded the earth upon the waters, * O all-powerful One. Do away with all the barrenness of mine unfruitful thoughts, and show my soul to be fruitful through the virtues, O most pure Theotokos, helper of the faithful. O all-immaculate one who hast given birth to the paternal Light, deliver me from every evil circumstance, from the many temptations of the serpent, and from eternal fire and darkness. Wholly condemned am I by the dread tribunal, the unquenchable fire and the stern sentence, O most pure one. Hasten thou, O most pure Lady, to save me, thy servant. To deify mankind, God became a man through thee, in a manner past all telling and understanding, O pure Virgin; wherefore, all of us the faithful together call thee blessed. </p><h3>Ode IV</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> I have heard report of Thee, O Lord * and I am afraid. * Having understood Thy works, * I have glorified Thy might, * thus said the prophet. Though Thou art the righteous Bestower of the law, Thou wast reckoned among the lawless, and wast lifted up upon the Tree, desiring to justify all, O Lord our Benefactor. All the angelic hosts marveled, beholding Thee, the Sun, uplifted upon the Cross; and the hordes of the prince of darkness were vanquished. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having drawn forth the grace of healings from the gifts of the Spirit, by the grace of God the martyrs wash away soul-corrupting passions for all. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having shaken off the slumber of indifference, with godly vigilance and faith the passion-bearers tamed the savagery of the wild beasts and suffered, rejoicing. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> “Woe is me, O my Child!

O Virgin Theotokos, thou undefiled tabernacle, by thy compassions, as with outpourings of great purity, cleanse me who am defiled by transgressions, and grant me a helping-hand, that I may cry: Glory to thee, O pure Bride of God! Thou wast shown to be a temple dedicated to God Who made His abode within thee in a manner transcending understanding. Him do thou entreat, that He cleanse us of the defilements of sin, that we may be known to be the temples and habitations of the Spirit. Have mercy on me, O Theotokos, who alone hast given birth to the Wellspring of mercies; and do away with the grievous illness of my soul and the perplexity of my heart. Before the end grant me compunction, a stream of tears, and deliverance from evils. O holy Theotokos who hast given birth to the Most Holy One in the flesh, sanctify us, that we may emulate Him Whose desire it was to become like men; and by thy supplications show us all to share in the kingdom of heaven, O most pure one. </p><h3>Ode V</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Shine forth thy radiant and everlasting light * upon us who rise early at dawn, * unto the judgments of Thy commandments, * O Master, Lover of mankind, * Christ our God.  Uplifted upon the Cross in the flesh, Thou didst call to the knowledge of Thee the nations who knew Thee not, O Judge of all, O only merciful Christ our God. When Thou didst stand before the unjust tribunal, O righteous Lord, Adam, who before was condemned, was justified; and he crieth out: Glory to Thy crucifixion, O long-suffering Lord! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye were shown to be like a divinely planted garden of paradise, O martyrs, having your honored sufferings as fragrant flowers, whereby the soul of each of the faithful is filled with sweet fragrance. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Let us hymn the martyrs of the Lord, the blossom-laden and right fruitful trees which put forth the fruit of faith in immortality, and pulled up the roots of evil. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> When the precious rod who produced the never-fading Bloom beheld Him uplifted upon the Tree, she cried: “O Master, leave me not childless!” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Grant us Thy peace, O Son of God, * for we know no other God than Thee, * and we call upon Thy Name, * for Thou art the God of the living and the dead. The wicked tasting in Eden once made me subject to mortality, but do thou, O most pure one who hast given birth unto Life, enliven me now who of old was slain by the tree, and grant me compunction. Save me from cruel misfortunes, O most pure one, raise me up out of the mire of the passions, and deliver me, Thine useless servant, from the captivity and oppression of the evil demons. Enlighten the eyes of my soul, that I may ever gaze upon thy divine radiance and glory, O pure and all-immaculate one, and may receive mercy and everlasting glory. O pure Virgin Mother, we know thee to be the cloud and garden of paradise, the portal of the Light, the table, the fleece, the jar containing manna, the sweetness of the world. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Thou didst save the Prophet from the sea monster, O Lover of mankind; * lead me up also I pray, * from the abyss of transgressions.  O Christ Who dost surpass all honor, lifted up upon the Cross Thou didst endure dishonor, desiring to honor mankind. O supremely good Christ our God, Who wast beaten with a reed, Thou hast signed an emancipation edict for me who have been enslaved to delusion. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Through painful sufferings ye passed over to the end which is devoid of pain, O holy ones, and have been deemed worthy of ineffable joy. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye were set afire by the burning coals of the love of Christ, O most wise ones; wherefore, cast into the fire ye remained unconsumed. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> After giving birth, O all-immaculate one, thou didst remain as thou wast before birthgiving; for thou hast given birth unto God Who saved mankind by the Tree. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Emulating the Prophet Jonah, I cry aloud: * Free Thou my life from corruption, O Good One; * and save me who crieth out: * O Savior of the world, Glory be to Thee!  I pray to thee, the only good one, the undefiled tabernacle: By your mediation wash away all defilement from me who have been defiled by many sins. Be thou a guide for me who am tossed about on the deep of evils by the needs of life, O pure one; steer me to the true harbor, and save me. Threefold billows of wicked thoughts, assaults of the passions and the abyss of sin overwhelm my wretched soul. Help me, O holy Lady! O Mary, thou sacred tabernacle which hath been revealed, sanctify my wretched soul, which hath been defiled by pleasures. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The furnace became bedewed, O Savior, * and the children dancing, chanted: * O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!  When Thou wast crucified, Thou didst shake creation; and when Thou didst die, Thou didst slay the serpent. Blessed art Thou, O Christ, God of our fathers! Thou didst taste gall, O Long-suffering One, pouring forth the sweetness of salvation upon me who was deprived of the food of paradise through pleasurable eating. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having their nails torn out, and having set aside the coarseness of mortality, the martyrs received divine beauty from God. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Emulating the most pure sufferings of Christ by your own sufferings, O valiant martyrs, ye easily bore the wounds inflicted by the enemy. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Seeing Thee, the Lord, crucified, the immaculate Theotokos said: “Woe is me, O my Son! How is it that Thou diest, O Life and Hope of the faithful?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> When Thy children were in the furnace O savior, * and remained untouched by the flame, * with one voice the three chanted * and blessed Thee saying: * O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou! Sanctify my soul, which hath been defiled by the passions, O most pure Bride of God, and quickly bring an end to the grievous captivity of my mind, the perplexity of my heart and the onslaughts of the demons. Enliven my mind, which hath been driven to death by carnal passions, O all-immaculate one, and strengthen me to do works pleasing unto God, that I may magnify thee and ever glorify thy compassion. O Virgin Mother, who alone hast given birth unto God, mortify my carnal pleasures and quickly remove the defilement of my soul. Deliver me from the inquisition of the demons, and save me. Arrayed in godly virtues, thou hast given birth to the Word Who with the Father is equally without beginning, and Who hath truly covered the heavens with virtues, O pure Virgin. Him do thou ever entreat, that He have pity on us. </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Unto Christ who saved the children * that sang His praises * and who bedewed the raging furnace, * let us hymn and supremely exalt throughout all ages.  When Thou wast nailed to the Cross, O Savior, creation was shaken, the sun stopped its shining, and the rocks split asunder; and Hades was soon emptied, unable to withstand Thy might. O Compassionate One, Thou didst hang naked on the Tree, suffering condemnation for the condemnation of him who was cast out, receiving nakedness. Great is Thy might and long-suffering! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Armed with the Cross as with a breast-plate, the warriors of Christ, who dwell with the incorporeal ones, arrayed themselves against the adversary and trampled him beneath their beautiful feet. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Their members broken, the valiant ones stood with hammers in the midst of the tribunal, demolishing the edifice of deception and razing the temples of the demons. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Beholding Him Who alone is most high uplifted upon the Tree and putting down the uprisings of the enemy, she who is more exalted than the heavens hymned Him aloud. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Him of whom the angels and all the hosts of heaven are in awe * as their Lord and Creator, * ye priests hymn, ye children praise, * ye peoples bless and supremely exalt * throughout all ages. In a godly manner He Who is incorporeal became incarnate from thee. Him do thou beseech, O most pure one, that He slay my carnal passions and give life to my soul, which hath been slain by my sins. O most pure one, thou hast given birth to God the Savior, Who healeth the contrition of Adam, who had been fashioned from dust. Him do thou entreat, that He heal the incurably painful wounds of my soul. Raise me up who lie in the depths of evils, vanquish now him who wageth war against me, O pure one, and disdain not my soul, which hath been wounded by unseemly pleasures. Have pity, O most pure one, and save me. By thy vigilant prayers unto God we, who know thee to be the blessed and joyous Theotokos, are delivered from all manner of temptations, O most pure one. We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the </p><p><i class="note">refrain:</i> “More honorable than the cherubim ...”<i class="note"> Prostrations.</i> </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Moses saw thee as the bush * unconsumed by fire, * and Jacob beheld thee as the living ladder * and the gate of heaven, * through which Christ our God hath passed. * In our hymns, O pure Mother, thee do we magnify. O how the disobedient people gave over to the Cross Thee, the only Long-suffering One, Who didst willingly impoverish Thyself, accepted sufferings, and by dispassion became a Mediator for all who had stumbled, from Adam on. Thou didst undergo a shameful crucifixion in the flesh, O Christ, desiring to honor man who was dishonored by irrational passions and had marred his ancient beauty. Glory be to Thy tender compassion, which transcendeth understanding! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> To the light of Thine ineffable glory and radiance didst Thou guide those who rose at dawn unto Thee, and who, led by Thy hand, traversed the darkness of sufferings, O Christ, Thou never-setting Sun. Wherefore, by their supplications enlighten us. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The company of the sacred martyrs vanquished the myriads of the noetic foe; they enrolled among the myriads of the holy powers, and at the command of the Creator of all ever heal the myriad passions of our souls. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> With the light of the Light Who shone forth from thee in the flesh, O Virgin, illumine my mind and enlighten my heart, driving away the darkness of sin and dispelling all the gloom of my despondency. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The light-bearing cloud upon whom * the beginningless Master of all descended from heaven, * like the dew upon the fleece, * and of whom He was incarnate, * becoming a man for our sake, * let us all magnify as the pure Mother of God.  Loving sin, I abide in slothfulness, O pure one, and I tremble before the inescapable tribunal. Keep me uncondemned thereat by thy holy supplications, O most pure Bride of God, that I may bless thee as mine intercessor. I am terrified of the tribunal and the unforgettable eye of thy Son, O Virgin, for I have committed many sins on earth; wherefore, I cry unto thee: O most loving Lady, help me, deliver me from tribulations then, O pure one, and save me. How terrible is the day of trial, O Maiden! How horrible the sentence! How bitter the misfortune! How can I endure more, O most pure Lady? Have mercy upon my passion-fraught soul, and before the end grant me remission, O most pure one. O thou who hast given birth to the divine Light Who shone forth from the Father, have pity on my soul, which hath been darkened by the deceptions of life and hath become an object of the mockery of the demons, O all-immaculate one; and grant unto me the light of saving repentance, O pure one.

<h3>Psalm 119</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN I was in trouble I called upon the Lord: and he heard me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitful tongue.
What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue: even mighty
and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.
Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech: and to have my
habitation among the tents of Kedar.
My soul hath long dwelt among them: that are enemies unto peace.
I labour for peace, but when I speak unto them thereof: they make them ready to
battle.
<h3>Psalm 120</h3>
A song of ascents
I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel: shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defence upon thy right hand.
So that the sun shall not burn thee by day: neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even he that shall keep thy
soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from this time forth for
evermore.
<h3>Psalm 121</h3>
A song of ascents
I WAS glad when they said unto me: We will go into the house of the Lord.
Our feet shall stand in thy gates: O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city: that is at unity in itself.
For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord: to testify unto Israel, to
give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.
For there is the seat of judgement: even the seat of the house of David.
O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
Peace be within thy walls: and plenteousness within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions' sakes: I will wish thee prosperity.
Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God: I will seek to do thee good.
<h3>Psalm 122</h3>
A song of ascents
UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as
the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even so our eyes wait
upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are utterly despised.
Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy: and with the
despitefulness of the proud.
<h3>Psalm 123</h3>
A song of ascents
IF THE Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say: if the Lord
himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;
They had swallowed us up quick: when thy were so wrathfully displeased at us.
Yea, the waters had drowned us: and the stream had gone over our soul.
The deep waters of the proud: had gone even over our soul.
But praised be the Lord: who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.
Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler: the snare is
broken, and we are delivered .
Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.

<h3>Psalm 124</h3>
A song of ascents
THEY that put their trust in the Lord shall be even as the mount Sion: which may
not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.
The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about his
people, from this time forth for evermore.
For the rod of the ungodly cometh not into the lot of the righteous: lest the
righteous put their hand unto wickedness.
Do well, O Lord: unto those that are good and true of heart.
As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness: the Lord shall lead them
forth with the evil-doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 125</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion: then were we like unto them
that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue with joy.
Then said they among the heathen: The Lord hath done great things for them.
Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already: whereof we rejoice.
Turn our captivity, O Lord: as the rivers in the south.
They that sow in tears: shall reap in joy.
He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed: shall
doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.
<h3>Psalm 126</h3>
A song of ascents
EXCEPT the Lord build the house: their labour is but lost that build it.
Except the Lord keep the city: the watchman waketh but in vain.
It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat
the bread of carefulness: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Lo, children and the fruit of the womb: are an heritage and gift that cometh of
the Lord.
Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant: even so are the young children.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed
when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
<h3>Psalm 127</h3>
A song of ascents
BLESSED are all they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: O well is thee, and happy shalt
thou be.
Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of thine house.
Thy children like the olive-branches: round about thy table.
Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the Lord.
The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shalt see Jerusalem in
prosperity all thy life long.
Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children: and peace upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 128</h3>
A song of ascents
MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up: may Israel now
say.
Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up: but they have not
prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed upon my back: and made long furrows.
But the righteous Lord: hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.
Let them be confounded and turned backward: as many as have evil will at Sion.
Let them be even as the grass growing upon the house-tops: which withereth
afore it be plucked up;
Whereof the mower filleth not his hand: neither he that bindeth up the sheaves
his bosom.
So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord prosper you: we wish you
good luck in the Name of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 129</h3>
A song of ascents
OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.
O let thine ears consider well: the voice of my complaint.
If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss: O Lord, who may
abide it?
For there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared.
I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him: in his word is my trust.
My soul fleeth unto the Lord: before the morning watch, I say, before the
morning watch.
O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with him is
plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel: from all his sins.
<h3>Psalm 130</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, I am not high-minded: I have no proud looks.
I do not exercise myself in great matters: which are too high for me.
But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his
mother: yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.
O Israel, trust in the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 131</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, remember David: and all his trouble;
How he sware unto the Lord: and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God of Jacob;
I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house: nor climb up into my bed;
I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eye-lids to slumber: neither the
temples of my head to take any rest;
Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord: an habitation for the mighty
God of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of the same at Ephrata: and found it in the wood.
We will go into his tabernacle: and fall low on our knees before his footstool.
Arise, O Lord, into thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness: and let thy saints sing with
joyfulness.
For thy servant David's sake: turn not away the presence of thine Anointed.
The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David: and he shall not shrink from it;
Of the fruit of thy body: shall I set upon thy seat.
If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall learn them:
their children also shall sit upon thy seat for evermore.
For the Lord hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself: he hath longed for
her.
This shall be my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.
I will bless her victuals with increase: and will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will deck her priests with health: and her saints shall rejoice and sing.
There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: I have ordained a lantern for
mine Anointed.
As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame: but upon himself shall his
crown flourish.
<h3>Psalm 132</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is: brethren, to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down unto the beard:
even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts of his clothing.
Like as the dew of Hermon: which fell upon the hill of Sion.
For there the Lord promised his blessing: and life for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 133</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD now, praise the Lord: all ye servants of the Lord;
Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord: even in the courts of the house of
our God.
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary: and praise the Lord.
The Lord that made heaven and earth: give thee blessing out of Sion.

<h3>Psalm 109</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool.
The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: be thou ruler, even in the
midst among thine enemies.
In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free-will offerings with an holy
worship: the dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning.
The Lord sware, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech..
The Lord upon thy right hand: shall wound even kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places with the dead bodies:
and smite in sunder the heads over divers countries.
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up his head.
<h3>Psalm 110</h3>
Alleluia
I WILL give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart: secretly among the
faithful, and in the congregation.
The works of the Lord are great: sought out of all of them that have pleasure
therein.
His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour: and his righteousness
endureth for ever.
The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvellous works: that they
ought to be had in remembrance.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he shall ever be mindful of his
covenant.
He hath shewed his people the power of his works: that he may give them the
heritage of the heathen.
The works of his hands are verity and judgement: all his commandments are
true.
They stand fast for ever and ever: and are done in truth and equity.
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever;
holy and reverend is his Name.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all
they that do thereafter; the praise of it endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 111</h3>
Alleluia
BLESSED is the man that feareth the Lord: he hath great delight in his
commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall be
blessed.
Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth
for ever.
Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness: he is merciful, loving, and
righteous.
A good man is merciful, and lendeth: and will guide his words with discretion.
For he shall never be moved: and the righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance.
He will not be afraid of any evil tidings: for his heart standeth fast, and believeth
in the Lord.
His heart is established, and will not shrink: until he see his desire upon his
enemies.
He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor: and his righteousness
remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him: he shall gnash with his teeth,
and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.

<h3>Psalm 112</h3>
Alleluia
PRAISE the Lord, ye servants: O praise the Name of the Lord.
Blessed be the Name of the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
The Lord's Name is praised: from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of
the same.
The Lord is high above all heathen and his glory above the heavens.
Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling so high: and yet
humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?
He taketh up the simple out of the dust: and lifteth the poor out of the mire;
That he may set him with the princes: even with the princes of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house: and to be a joyful mother of
children.
<h3>Psalm 113</h3>
Alleluia
WHEN Israel came out of Egypt: and the house of Jacob from among the strange
people.
Judah was his sanctuary: and Israel his dominion.
The sea saw that, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams: and the little hills like young sheep.
What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest: and thou Jordan, that thou wast
driven back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams: and ye little hills, like young sheep?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the God of
Jacob.
Who turned the hard rock into a standing water: and the flint-stone into a
springing well.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise: for thy
loving mercy and for thy truth's sake.
Wherefore shall the heathen say: Where is now their God?
As for our God, he is in heaven: he hath done whatsoever pleased him.
Their idols are silver and gold: even the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not.
They have ears, and hear not: noses have they and smell not.
They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not: neither speak
they through their throat.
They that make them are like unto them ; and so are all such as put their trust in
them.
But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their succour and defence.
Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
Ye that fear the Lord, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
The Lord hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us: even he shall bless the
house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.
He shall bless them that fear the Lord: both small and great.
The Lord shall increase you more and more: you and your children.
Ye are the blessed of the Lord: who made heaven and earth.
All the whole heavens are the Lord's: the earth hath he given to the children of
men.
The dead praise not thee, O Lord: neither all they that go down into silence.
But we will praise the Lord: from this time forth for evermore. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 114</h3>
Alleluia
I AM well pleased: that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer.
That he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call upon him as long as I
live.
The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of hell gat hold
upon me.
I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I will call upon the Name of the Lord: O
Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea, our God is merciful
The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.
Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul: for the Lord hath rewarded thee.
And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from tears, and my
feet from falling.
I will walk before the Lord: in the land of the living.

<h3>Psalm 115</h3>
Alleluia
I BELIEVED, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled: I said in my
haste, All men are liars.
What reward shall I give unto the Lord: for all the benefits that he hath done
unto me?
I will receive the cup of salvation: and call upon the Name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: right dear in the sight of
the Lord is the death of his saints.
Behold, O Lord, how that I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thine
handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the Name of
the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of all his people: in the courts of
the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 116</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, all ye heathen: praise him, all ye nations.
For his merciful kindness is ever more and more towards us: and the truth of the
Lord endureth for ever. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 117</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: because his mercy endureth for
ever.
Let Israel now confess that he is gracious: and that his mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
Yea, let them now that fear the Lord confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
I called upon the Lord in trouble: and the Lord heard me at large.
The Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man doeth unto me.
The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire
upon mine enemies.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in man.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in princes.
All nations compassed me round about: but in the Name of the Lord will I destroy
them.
They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side: but in the
Name of the Lord will I destroy them.
They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire among the thorns:
for in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.
Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but the Lord was my help.
The Lord is my strength, and my song: and is become my salvation.
The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous: the right hand of
the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass.
The right hand of the Lord hath the pre-eminence: the right hand of the Lord
bringeth mighty things to pass.
I shall not die, but live: and declare the works of the Lord.
The Lord hath chastened and corrected me: but he hath not given me over unto
death.
Open me the gates of righteousness: that I may go into them, and give thanks
unto the Lord.
This is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into it.
I will thank thee, for thou hast heard me: and art become my salvation.
The same stone which the builders refused: is become the head-stone in the
corner.
This is the Lord's doing: and it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath made: we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Help me now, O Lord: O Lord, send us now prosperity.

Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: thou art my God, and I will praise thee.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for ever.

Known on earth as radiant morning-stars, ye illumined the faithful with the light of piety, O most glorious sword-bearers of Christ, ye most wise and holy hierarchs.

<h3>Psalm 1</h3>
BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
stood in the way of sinners: and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful.
But his delight is in the law of the Lord: and in his law will he exercise himself
day and night.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side: that will bring forth his
fruit in due season.
His leaf also shall not wither: and look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper.
As for the ungodly, it is not so with them: but they are like the chaff, which the
wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.
Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment: neither the
sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
But the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: and the way of the ungodly shall
perish.
<h3>Psalm 2</h3>
WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why do the people imagine a
vain thing?
The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together: against the
Lord, and against his Anointed.
Let us break their bonds asunder: and cast away their cords from us.
He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: the Lord shall have them
in derision.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath: and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Yet I have set my King: upon my holy hill of Sion.
I will preach the law, whereof the Lord hath said unto me: Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee.
Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance: and the
utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron: and break them in pieces like a
potter's vessel.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be learned, ye that are judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord in fear: and rejoice unto him with reverence.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way: if his wrath
be kindled, (yea, but a little,) blessed are all they that put their trust in
him.
<h3>Psalm 3</h3>
A psalm of David. When he fled from the presence of his son Absalom
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me: many are they that rise against
me.
Many one there be that say of my soul: There is no help for him in his God.
But thou, O Lord, art my defender: thou art my worship, and the lifter up of my
head.
I did call upon the Lord with my voice: and he heard me out of his holy hill.
I laid me down and slept, and rose up again: for the Lord sustained me.
I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people: that have set themselves
against me round about.
Up, Lord, and help me, O my God: for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the
cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 4</h3>
For the end. A song of David among the Psalms
HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast set me at liberty
when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour: and have such
pleasure in vanity, and seek after leasing?
Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that is godly: when
I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart, and in your chamber,
and be still.
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness: and put your trust in the Lord.
There be many that say: Who will shew us any good?
Lord, lift thou up: the light of thy countenance upon us.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart: since the time that their corn and wine and
oil increased.
I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest: for it is thou, Lord, only, that
makest me dwell in safety.
<h3>Psalm 5</h3>
For the end. A song of David concerning her that inherits
PONDER my words, O Lord: consider my meditation
O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King, and my God: for unto thee
will I make my prayer.
My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O Lord: early in the morning will I direct my
prayer unto thee, and will look up.
For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness: neither shall any devil
dwell with thee.
Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest all of them that
work vanity.
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor both the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude of thy
mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies: make thy way
plain before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in his mouth: their inward parts are very wickedness.
Their throat is an open sepulchre: they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own imaginations: cast
them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebelled
against thee.
And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: they shall ever be giving of
thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be
joyful in thee;
For thou, Lord, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous: and with thy favourable
kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
<h3>Psalm 6</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns for the eighth
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy
displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones are
vexed.
My soul also is sore troubled: but, Lord, how long wilt thou punish me?
Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's sake.
For in death no man remembereth thee: and who will give thee thanks in the pit?
I am weary of my groaning; every night wash I my bed: and water my couch with
my tears.
My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of all mine enemies.
Away from me, all ye that work vanity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my
weeping.
The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer.
All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed: they shall be turned back,
and put to shame suddenly.

<h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 7</h3>
A psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the Benjamite
O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all them that
persecute me, and deliver me;
Lest he devour my soul, like a lion, and tear it in pieces: while there is none to
help.
O Lord my God, if I have done any such thing: or if there be any wickedness in
my hands;
If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me: yea, I have delivered
him that without any cause is mine enemy,
Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me: yea, let him tread my life
down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.
Stand up, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignation of
mine enemies: arise up for me in the judgement that thou hast
commanded.
And so shall the congregation of the people come about thee: for their sakes
therefore lift up thyself again.
The Lord shall judge the people; give sentence with me, O Lord: according to my
righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in me.
O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end: but guide thou the just.
For the righteous God: trieth the very hearts and reins.
My help cometh of God: who preserveth them that are true of heart.
God is a righteous Judge, strong and patient: and God is provoked every day.
If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword: he hath bent his bow, and made it
ready.
He hath prepared for him the instruments of death: he ordaineth his arrows
against the persecutors
Behold, he travaileth with mischief: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth
ungodliness.
He hath graven and digged up a pit: and is fallen on himself into the destruction
that he made for other.
For his travail shall come upon his own head: and his wickedness shall fall on his
own pate.
I will give thanks unto the Lord, according to his righteousness: and I will praise
the Name of the Lord most High.
<h3>Psalm 8</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the winepresses
O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world: thou hast set
thy glory above the heavens!
Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength,
because of thine enemies: that thou mightest still the enemy and the
avenger.
For I will consider thy heavens, even the works of thy fingers: the moon and the
stars, which thou hast ordained.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him: and the son of man, that thou visitest
him?
Thou madest him lower than the angels: to crown him with glory and worship.
Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands: and thou hast put
all things in subjection under his feet;
All sheep and oxen: yea, and the beasts of the field;
The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and whatsoever walketh through
the paths of the seas.
O Lord our Governor: how excellent is thy Name in all the world!

marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O thou

For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in the throne that
judgest right.
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly: thou hast put out
their name for ever and ever.
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: even as the cities which
thou hast destroyed, their memorial is perished with them.
But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath also prepared his seat for judgement.
For he shall judge the world in righteousness: and minister true judgement unto
the people.
The Lord also will be a defence for the oppressed: even a refuge in due time of
trouble.
And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast
never failed them that seek thee.
O praise the Lord which dwelleth in Sion: show the people of his doings.
For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them :and forgetteth
not the complaint of the poor.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider the trouble which I suffer of them that
hate me: thou that liftest me up from the gates of death.
That I may shew all thy praises within the ports of the daughter of Sion: I will
rejoice in thy salvation.
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the same net which they
hid privily, is their foot taken.
The Lord is known to execute judgement: the ungodly is trapped in the work of
his own hands.
The wicked shall be turned into hell: and all the people that forget God.
For the poor shall not always be forgotten: the patient abiding of the meek shall
not perish for ever.
Up, Lord, and let not man have the upper hand: let the heathen be judged in thy
sight.
Put them in fear, O Lord: that the heathen may know themselves to be but men.
Why standest thou so far off, O Lord: and hidest thy face in the needful time of
trouble?
The ungodly for his own lust doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the
crafty wiliness that they have imagined.
For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire: and speaketh good of
the covetous, whom God abhorreth.
The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God ; neither is God in all his
thoughts.
His ways are always grievous: thy judgments are far above out of his sight, and
therefore defieth he all his enemies.
For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down: there shall no
harm happen unto me.
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is ungodliness
and vanity.
He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets: and privily in his lurking
dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.
For he lieth waiting secretly, even as a lion lurketh he in his den: that he may
ravish the poor.
He doth ravish the poor: when he getteth him into his net.
He falleth down, and humbleth himself: that the congregation of the poor may
fall into the hands of his captains.
He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face, and
he will never see it.
Arise, O Lord God, and lift up thine hand: forget not the poor.
Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God: while he doth say in his heart,
Tush, thou God carest not for it.
Surely thou hast seen it: for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong.
That thou mayest take the matter into thy hand: the poor committeth himself
unto thee; for thou art the helper of the friendless.
Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious: take away his ungodliness,
and thou shalt find none.
The Lord is King for ever and ever: and the heathen are perished out of the land.
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the poor: thou preparest their heart, and
thine ear hearkeneth thereto;
To help the fatherless and poor unto their right: that the man of the earth be no
more exalted against them.
<h3>Psalm10</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
IN THE Lord put I my trust: how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a
bird unto the hill?
For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the
quiver: that they may privily shoot at them which are true of heart.
For the foundations will be cast down: and what have the righteous done?
The Lord is in his holy temple: the Lord's seat is in heaven.
His eyes consider the poor: and his eye-lids try the children of men.
The Lord alloweth the righteous: but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in
wickedness, doth his soul abhor.
Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest:
this shall be their portion to drink.
For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness: his countenance will behold the
thing that is just

<h3>Psalm11</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, upon the eighth
HELP me, Lord, for there is not one godly man left: for the faithful are minished
from among the children of men,
They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour: they do but flatter with their
lips, and dissemble in their double heart.
The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips: and the tongue that speaketh proud
things;
Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail: we are they that ought to
speak , who is lord over us?
Now for the comfortless trouble's sake of the needy: and because of the deep
sighing of the poor,
I will up, saith the Lord: and will help every one from him that swelleth against
him, and will set him at rest.
The words of the Lord are pure words: even as the silver, which from the earth is
tried, and purified seven times in the fire.
Thou shalt keep them, O Lord: thou shalt preserve him from this generation for
ever.
The ungodly walk on every side: when they are exalted, the children of men are
put to rebuke.
<h3>Psalm12</h3>
For the end, psalm of David
HOW long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever: how long wilt thou hide thy face
from me?
How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart: how long
shall mine enemies triumph over me?
Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in
death.
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: for if I be cast down, they
that trouble me will rejoice at it.
But my trust is in thy mercy: and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.
I will sing of the Lord, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me: yea, I will
praise the Name of the Lord most Highest.
<h3>Psalm13</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE fool hath said in his heart: There is no God.
They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings: there is none that
doeth good, no not one.
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there
were any that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is none that doeth good, no not one.
Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have they deceived: the
poison of asps is under their lips.
Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood.
Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they not
known ; there is no fear of God before their eyes.
Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief: eating up my
people as it were bread, and call not upon the Lord?
There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was: for God is in the
generation of the righteous.
As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor: because he putteth
his trust in the Lord.
Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turneth the
captivity of his people: then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

<h3>Psalm14</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle: or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?
Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life: and doeth the thing which is right, and
speaketh the truth from his heart.
He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour: and
hath not slandered his neighbour.
He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes: and maketh much of
them that fear the Lord.
He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not: thou it were to
his own hindrance.
He that hath not given his money upon usury: nor taken reward against the
innocent.
Whoso doeth these things: shall never fall.
<h3>Psalm15</h3>
A writing of David
PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee have I put my trust.
O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, my goods are nothing
unto thee.
All my delight is upon the saints, that are in the earth: and upon such as excel in
virtue.
But they that run after another god: shall have great trouble.
Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer: neither make mention of their
names within my lips.
The Lord himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou shalt
maintain my lot.
The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will thank the Lord for giving me warning: my reins also chasten me in the
night-season.
I have set God always before me: for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not
fall.
Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiced: my flesh also shall rest in
hope.
For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell: neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy
One to see corruption.
Thou shalt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is the fulness of joy: and at
thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.
<h3>Psalm16</h3>
A prayer of David
HEAR the right, O Lord, consider my complaint: and hearken unto my prayer,
that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence: and let thine eyes look upon the
thing that is equal.
Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night-season; thou hast tried me,
and shalt find no wickedness in me; for I am utterly purposed that my
mouth shall not offend.
Because of men's works, that are done against the words of thy lips: I have kept
me from the ways of the destroyer.
O hold thou up my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps slip not.
I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: incline thine ear to me,
and hearken unto my words.
Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which
put their trust in thee: from such as resist thy right hand.
Keep me as the apple of an eye: hide me under the shadow of thy wings.
From the ungodly that trouble me: mine enemies compass me round about to
take away my soul.
They are enclosed in their own fat: and their mouth speaketh proud things.
They lie waiting in our way on every side: turning their eyes down to the ground.
Like of a lion that is greedy of his prey: and as it were a lion's whelp. lurking in
secret places.
Up, Lord, disappoint him, and cast him down: deliver my soul from the ungodly,
which is a sword of thine;
From the men of thy hand, O Lord, from the men, I say, and from the evil world:
which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid
treasure.
They have children at their desire: and leave the rest of their substance for their
babes.
But as for me, I will behold thy presence in righteousness: and when I awake up
after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied with it.</div>

<h3>Psalm 17</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David the servant of the Lord. The words which he spoke to the Lord,
even the words of this song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his
enemies, and out of the hand of Saul. And he said:
I WILL love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony rock, and my
defence: my saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust, my
buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.
I will call upon the Lord, which is worthy to be praised: so shall I be safe from
mine enemies.
The sorrows of death compassed me: and the overflowings of ungodliness made
me afraid.
The pains of hell came about me: the snares of death overtook me.
In my trouble I will call upon the Lord: and complain unto my God.
So shall he hear my voice out of his holy temple: and my complaint shall come
before him, it shall enter even into his ears.
The earth trembled and quaked: the very foundations also of the hills shook, and
were removed, because he was wroth.
There went a smoke out in his presence: and a consuming fire out of his mouth,
so that coals were kindled at it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and it was dark under his feet.
He rode upon the cherubim, and did fly: he came flying upon the wings of the
wind.
He made darkness his secret place: his pavilion round about him, with dark
water and thick clouds to cover him.
At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed: hail-stones and coals of
fire.
The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hailstones and coals of fire.
He sent out his arrows, and scattered them: he cast forth lightnings, and
destroyed them.
The springs of water were seen, and the foundations of the round world were
discovered, at thy chiding, O Lord: at the blasting of the breath of thy
displeasure.
He shall send down from on high to fetch me: and shall take me out of many
waters.
He shall deliver from me my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me: for
they are too mighty for me.
They prevented me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my upholder.
He brought me forth also into a place of liberty: he brought me forth even
because he had a favour unto me.
The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing: according to the cleanness
of my hands shall he recompense me.
Because I have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not forsaken my God, as the
wicked doth.
For I have an eye unto all his laws: and will not cast out his commandments from
me.
I was also uncorrupt before him: and eschewed mine own wickedness.
Therefore shall the Lord reward me after my righteous dealing: and according
unto the cleanness of my hands in his eye-sight.
With the holy thou shalt be holy: and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.
With the clean thou shalt be clean: and with the froward thou shalt learn
frowardness.
For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity: and shalt bring down the
high looks of the proud.
Thou also shalt light my candle: the Lord my God shall make my darkness to be
light.
For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men: and with the help of my God I shall
leap over the wall.
The way of God is an undefiled way: the word of the Lord also is tried in the fire;
he is the defender of all them that put their trust in him.
For who is God, but the Lord: or who hath any strength, except our God?
It is God, that girdeth me with strength of war: and maketh my way perfect.
He maketh my feet like harts' feet: and setteth me up on high.
He teacheth mine hands to fight: and mine arms shall break even a bow of steel.
Thou hast given me the defence of my salvation: thy right hand also shall hold
me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.
Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go: that my footsteps shall not
slide.
I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them: neither will I turn again till I
have destroyed them.
I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand: but fall under my feet.
Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou shalt throw done mine
enemies under me.
Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me: and I shall
destroy them that hate me.
They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them: yea, even unto the Lord
shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.
I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I will cast them out as the
clay in the streets.
Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people: and thou shalt make me
the head of the heathen.
A people whom I have not known: shall serve me.
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: but the strange children shall
dissemble with me.
The strange children shall fail: and be afraid out of their prisons.
The Lord liveth, and blessed be my strong helper: and praised be the Lord of my
salvation.
Even the God that seeth that I be avenged: and subdueth the people unto me.
It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine
adversaries: thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.
For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles: and sing
praises unto thy Name.
Great prosperity giveth he unto his King: and showeth loving-kindness unto
David his Anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.

<h3>Psalm 18</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament showeth his
handiwork.
One day telleth another: and one night certifieth another.
There is neither speech nor language: but their voices are heard among them.
Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words into the ends of the world.
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun: which cometh forth as a
bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.
It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the
end of it again: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, converting the soul: the testimony of the
Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: the commandment of
the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever: the judgments of the Lord
are true, and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also
than honey, and the honey-comb.
Moreover, by them is thy servant taught: and in keeping of them there is great
reward.
Who can tell how oft he offendeth: O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.
Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion over
me: so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart: be alway
acceptable in thy sight,
O Lord: my strength, and my redeemer.
<h3>Psalm 19</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the Name of the God of Jacob defend
thee;
Send thee help from the sanctuary: and strengthen thee out of Sion;
Remember all thy offerings: and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
Grant thee thy heart's desire: and fulfil all thy mind.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God:
the Lord perform all thy petitions.
Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Anointed, and will hear him from his holy
heaven: even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.
Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the
Name of the Lord our God.
They are brought down, and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, Lord and hear us, O King of heaven: when we call upon thee.
<h3>Psalm 20</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be of thy
salvation.
Thou hast given him his heart's desire: and hast not denied him the request of
his lips.
For thou shalt prevent him with the blessings of goodness: and shalt set a crown
of pure gold upon his head.
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life: even for ever and ever.
His honour is great in thy salvation: glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon
him.
For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity: and make him glad with the joy of thy
countenance.
And why? because the King putteth his trust in the Lord: and in the mercy of the
most Highest he shall not miscarry.
All thine enemies shall feel thine hand: thy right hand shall find out them that
hate thee.
Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: the Lord shall
destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.
Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth: and their seed from among the
children of men.
For they intended mischief against thee: and imagined such a device as they are
not able to perform.
Therefore shalt thou put them to flight: and the strings of thy bow shalt thou
make ready against the face of them.
Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so we will sing, and praise thy
power.

<h3>Psalm 21</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the morning aid.
MY GOD, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me: and art so far from
my health, and from the words of my complaint?
O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not: and in the night-season
also I take no rest.
And thou continuest holy: O thou worship of Israel.
Our fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them.
They called upon thee, and were holpen: they put their trust in thee, and were
not confounded.
But as for me, I am a worm, and no man: a very scorn of men, and the outcast of
the people.
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot our their lips, and shake their
heads, saying,
He trusted in God, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, if he will have
him.
But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: thou wast my hope, when
I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.
I have been left unto thee ever since I was born: thou art my God, even from my
mother's womb.
O go not from me, for trouble is hard at hand: and there is none to help me.
Many oxen are come about me: fat bulls of Basan close me in on every side.
They gape upon me with their mouths: as it were a ramping and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart also in the
midst of my body is even like melting wax.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my gums: and
thou shalt bring me into the dust of death.
For many dogs are come about me: and the council of the wicked layeth siege
against me.
They pierced my hands and my feet; I may tell all my bones: they stand staring
and looking upon me.
They part my garments among them: and casts lots upon my vesture.
But be not thou far from me, O Lord: thou art my succour, haste thee to help me.
Deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth: thou hast heard me also from among the horns of
the unicorns.
I will declare thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I
praise thee.
O praise the Lord, ye that fear him: magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob, and
fear him, all ye seed of Israel.
For he hath not despised, nor abhorred, the low estate of the poor: he hath not
hid his face from him, but when he called unto him he heard him.
My praise is of thee in the great congregation: my vows will I perform in the
sight of them that fear him.
The poor shall eat and be satisfied: they that seek after the Lord shall praise him;
your heart shall live for ever.
All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned unto the
Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him.
For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the Governor among the people.
All such as be fat upon earth: have eaten and worshipped.
All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him: and no man hath
quickened his own soul.
My seed shall serve him: they shall be counted unto the Lord for a generation.
They shall come, and the heavens shall declare his righteousness: unto a people
that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.
<h3>Psalm 22</h3>
A psalm of David
THE Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside the waters of
comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness, for
his Name's sake.
Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort me.
Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble me: thou hast
anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.
But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
<h3>Psalm 23</h3>
A psalm of David on the first day of the week
THE earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and
they that dwell therein.
For he hath founded it upon the seas: and prepared it upon the floods.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall rise up in his holy place?
Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart: and that hath not lift up his
mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord: and righteousness from the God of
his salvation.
This is the generation of them that seek him: even of them that seek thy face, O
Jacob.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: it is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty
in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: even the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.

I raise the eyes of my heart to Thee in heaven, O Savior. ** Save me by Thy

If the Lord was not amongst us, * who could be kept safe * from the one who 
is both our foe ** and a manslayer?

Those who trust in the Lord * are like unto the holy mountain: * they are

By the Holy Spirit all wisdom doth flow forth, * grace unto the Apostles, *

          <div><h3>Ode I</h3><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> In the deep of old the infinite Power overwhelmed Pharaoh's whole army. * But the Incarnate Word annihilated pernicious sin. * Exceedingly glorious is the Lord, * for gloriously hath He been glorified. </p><p>Having taken our form from thee, the never-setting Sun manifestly showed thee forth as a noetic and most splendid heaven. Wherefore, deliver me from the stench of the passions, that with love I may hymn thee, the only Virgin Mother. </p><p>I beseech thee, O Lady, who art the tongs which held the noetic Ember which hath purified human nature: Wash away the defilement of my manifold transgressions, and by thy supplications deliver me from defiling passions. </p><p>Glory ..., O most pure Theotokos, who hast given birth to Christ, the Wellspring of mercy, and hast opened Eden to mankind: open unto me the portals of thy mercy, and grant me forgiveness offenses, O Sovereign Lady of the world. </p><p>Now & ever ..., Rend asunder the bonds of my transgressions, O Ever-virgin Lady, entreating thy Son and God; and cast down sin which oppresseth me, that, saved, I may ever hymn thee, O most immaculate one. </p></div>
        
          <div><h3>Ode III</h3><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Thou hast established me on the rock of faith, * and my mouth hath been emboldened against mine enemies. * For my spirit rejoiceth when I sing: * There is none as holy as our God * and none more righteous than Thee, O Lord. </p><p>Dispel the gloom and darkness of my passions with the rays of thy supplications, and enlighten me, O most pure Lady who hast given birth to Christ, the never-setting Sun Who shone forth from the Sun before the morning-star. </p><p>By thy birthgiving, O most pure one, thou hast restored the fallen and broken tabernacle of David thy father; wherefore, O Theotokos, raise me up, thy servant, who am crushed by transgressions and the passions. </p><p>Glory ..., Be thou a sword, O Virgin, driving away the sins and passions of my soul, and show me to be another garden of paradise, preserved by thee un-assailed, offering thee the flowers of the Spirit. </p><p>Now & ever ..., Stretching forth the hand of compassions, receive me, O Birthgiver of God, and from all condemnation rescue me who flee to thee, and falling down before thee, call upon thine aid. </p></div>
        
          <div><h3>Ode IV</h3><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> I hymn Thee, O Lord, for I have heard report of Thee, * and I was afraid; * for Thou comest to me, seeking me who am lost. * Wherefore, I glorify Thy great condescension towards me, * O greatly Merciful One.  </p><p>Taking the leaven of human nature like dough, the Creator made it undefiled and holy; and washing me clean of the defilement of the passions, He hath cleansed me of the mire of my transgressions. </p><p>With the remedy of thy prayers, as with bandages and oil, O pure Lady, heal now the stripes of my soul and the wounds of sin, in that thou hast given birth to the divine Healing of nature. </p><p>Glory ..., Loose thou the bonds of my passions, O Lady, and cleave asunder the chains of my sins with the sword of thy prayers, O thou who hast given birth to Christ Who granteth deliverance to those bound in Hades. </p><p>Now & ever ..., Cure thou the passions of my soul which most wretchedly shroud me in gloom, and enlighten my thoughts, O pure one, driving far away the darkness of the demons who oppress me and who lay traps for me all the day long. </p></div>

Deliver me from unseemly thoughts and from all grief, for thou alone art the joy of the faithful. </p><p>A horde of demons surroundeth the city of my soul, striving mightily to take it captive. O most glorious Lady, thou city of the King of all, defend me by thy supplications as with entowered ramparts, and save me. </p><p>Glory ..., The cruel storm of the sedition of the spirits of evil doth trouble my mind. Quickly anticipate my need, and still it, O thou who hast given birth to Christ, the only almighty Helmsman of all creation. </p><p>Now & ever ..., O Birthgiver of God, shine the light of repentance upon me who am enclosed in the darkness of perdition.

I, thy servant, pray that through thee I might enter into the heavens. Wherefore, accept me, O Lady, and guide me by thy light. </p><p>Glory ..., Crucified on the Cross of His own will, Christ thy Son put the princes of darkness to shame and destroyed the corrupting power of death. </p><p>Thereby, O most pure Lady, do thou slay the passion-plagued understanding of my flesh. </p><p>Now & ever ..., Cease not, O pure one, to pray to God Who was born from thee, on behalf of those who approach thee with faith and ask deliverance, O only helper of the world, for thou art the hope and help of the despairing and the aid of those who are ever tempest-tossed amid evils. </p></div>
        
          <div><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Disdaining the golden image, the thrice-blessed children, * beholding the immutable and living image of God, * chanted in the midst of the flame: * Let all existing creation hymn the Lord * and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!  </p><p>O Virgin, thou divinely made tabernacle of the Holy of holies, of Him Who set thee forth as the image of the ancient tabernacle, having the great High Priest in thy midst: Show my heart to be a holy tabernacle of the Most High: Christ, the King of all. </p><p>Having borne, O Virgin, the divine ark and the tablets of the law: the most pure Word of God, Christ, thine uncircumscribable Son: by thy prayers, as with the finger of God, inscribe Him upon the surface of my soul. </p><p>Glory ..., As from a mountain the precious Stone hath been cut from thy womb, O most immaculate Lady, and as the only Almighty One He hath broken the pillars of all falsehood.

<h3>Psalm 24</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my trust in thee: O
let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.
For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed: but such as transgress
without a cause shall be put to confusion.
Shew me thy ways, O Lord: and teach me thy paths.
Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God of my salvation; in
thee hath been my hope all the day long.
Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender mercies: and thy loving-kindnesses,
which have been ever of old.
O remember not the sins and offences of my youth: but according to thy mercy
think thou upon me, O Lord, for thy goodness.
Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Them that are meek shall he guide in judgement: and such as are gentle, them
shall he learn his way.
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth: unto such as keep his covenant
and his testimonies.
For thy Name's sake, O Lord: be merciful unto my sin, for it is great.
What man is he that feareth the Lord: him shall he teach in the way that he shall
choose.
His soul shall dwell at ease: and his seed shall inherit the land.
The secret of the Lord is among them that fear him: and he will show them his
covenant.
Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out of the
net.
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am desolate and in misery.
The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my troubles.
Look upon my adversity and misery: and forgive me all my sin.
Consider mine enemies, how many they are: and they bear a tyrannous hate
against me.
O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be confounded, for I have put my
trust in thee.
Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me: for my hope hath been in
thee.
Deliver Israel, O God: out of all his troubles.
<h3>Psalm 25</h3>
A psalm of David
BE THOU my judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently: my trust hath been
also in the Lord, therefore shall I not fall.
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me: try out my reins and my heart.
For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes: and I will walk in thy truth.
I have not dwelt with vain persons: neither will I have fellowship with the
deceitful.
I have hated the congregation of the wicked: and will not sit among the ungodly.
I will wash my hands in innocency, O Lord: and so will I go to thine altar.
That I may show the voice of thanksgiving: and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house: and the place where thine honour
dwelleth.
O shut not up my soul with the sinners: nor my life with the blood-thirsty.
In whose hands is wickedness: and their right hand is full of gifts.
But as for me, I will walk innocently: O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.
My foot standeth right: I will praise the Lord in the congregations.
<h3>Psalm 26</h3>
A psalm of David before he was anointed
THE Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom then shall I fear: the Lord is the
strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my
flesh: they stumbled and fell.
Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid:
and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.
One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may dwell
in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of
the Lord, and to visit his temple.
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle: yea, in the secret
place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone.
And now shall he lift up mine head: above mine enemies round about me.
Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness: I will sing,
and speak praises unto the Lord.
Hearken unto my voice, O Lord, when I cry unto thee: have mercy upon me, and
hear me.
My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: Thy face, Lord, will I seek.
O hide not thou thy face from me: nor cast thy servant away in displeasure.
Thou hast been my succour: leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me: the Lord taketh me up.
Teach me the way, O Lord: and lead in the right way, because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: for there are false
witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.
I should utterly have fainted: but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the
Lord in the land of the living.
O tarry thou the Lord's leisure: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart ; and
put thou thy trust in the Lord.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 27</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee will I cry, O Lord my strength: think no scorn of me; lest, if thou
make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go down into the
pit.
Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee: when I hold up my
hands towards the mercy-seat of thy holy temple.
O pluck me not away, neither destroy me, with the ungodly and wicked doers:
which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mischief in their
hearts.
Reward them according to their deeds: and according to the wickedness of their
own inventions.
Recompense them after the work of their hands: pay them that they have
deserved.
For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his
hands: therefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.
Praised be the Lord: for he hath heard the voice of my humble petitions.
The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and I am
helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise
him.
The Lord is my strength: and he is the wholesome defence of his Anointed.
O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: feed them , and
set them up for ever.
<h3>Psalm 28</h3>
A psalm of David on the occasion of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle
BRING unto the Lord, O ye mighty, bring young rams unto the Lord: ascribe unto
the Lord worship and strength.
Give the Lord the honour due unto his Name: worship the Lord with holy
worship.
It is the Lord that commandeth the waters: it is the glorious God that maketh the
thunder.
It is the Lord that ruleth the sea; the voice of the Lord is mighty in operation: the
voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar-trees: yea, the Lord breaketh the
cedars of Libanus.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf: Libanus also, and Sirion, like a young
unicorn.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the Lord shaketh
the wilderness: yea, the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Cades.
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and discovereth the
thick bushes: in his temple doth every man speak of his honour.
The Lord sitteth above the water -flood: and the Lord remaineth a King for ever.
The Lord shall give strength unto his people: the Lord shall give his people the
blessing of peace.
<h3>Psalm 29</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song at the dedication of the house of David
I WILL magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up: and not made my foes to
triumph over me.
O Lord my God, I cried unto thee: and thou hast healed me.
Thou, Lord, hast brought my soul out of hell: thou hast kept my life from them
that go down to the pit.
Sing praises unto the Lord, O ye saints of his: and give thanks unto him for a
remembrance of his holiness.
For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his pleasure is life:
heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: thou, Lord, of thy
goodness hast made my hill so strong.
Thou didst turn thy face from me: and I was troubled.
Then cried I unto thee, O Lord: and gat me to my Lord right humbly.
What profit is there in my blood: when I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust give thanks unto thee: or shall it declare thy truth?
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.
Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and
girded me with gladness.
Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing: O my God, I
will give thanks unto thee for ever.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 30</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David; an utterance of extreme fear
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion, deliver
me in thy righteousness.
Bow down thine ear to me: make haste to deliver me.
And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence: that thou mayest save me.
For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: be thou also my guide, and lead me
for thy Name's sake.
Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my
strength.
Into thy hands I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou
God of truth.
I have hated them that hold of superstitious vanities: and my trust hath been in
the Lord.
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble, and
hast known my soul in adversities.
Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: but hast set my feet in a
large room.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord , for I am in trouble: and mine eye is consumed for
very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.
For my life is waxen old with heaviness: and my years with mourning.
My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity: and my bones are consumed.
I became a reproof among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours: and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me; and they
that did see me without conveyed themselves from me.
I am clean forgotten, as a dead man out of mind: I am become like a broken
vessel.
For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude: and fear is on every side, while
they conspire together against me, and take their counsel to take away my
life.
But my hope hath been in thee, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my God.
My time is in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies: and from
them that persecute me.
Shew thy servant the light of thy countenance: and save me for thy mercy's sake.
Let me not be confounded, O Lord for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be
put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.
Let the lying lips be put to silence: which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully,
speak against the righteous.
O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee:
and that thou hast prepared for them that put their trust in thee, even
before the sons of men!
Thou shalt hide them privily by thine own presence from the provoking of all
men: thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle from the strife of
tongues.
Thanks be to the Lord: for he hath shewed me marvellous great kindness in a
strong city.
And when I made haste, I said: I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.
Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer: when I cried unto thee.
26.O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth them that are
faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.
Be strong, and he shall establish your heart: all that ye put your trust in the
Lord.
<h3>Psalm 31</h3>
A psalm of instruction by David
BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven: and whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no sin: and in whose spirit
there is no guile.
For while I held my tongue: my bones consumed away through my daily
complaining.
For thy hand is heavy upon me day and night: and my moisture is like the
drought in summer.
I will acknowledge my sin unto thee: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.
I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord: and so thou forgavest the wickedness
of my sin.
For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a time when
thou mayest be found: but in the great water-floods they shall not come
nigh him.
Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shalt preserve me from trouble: thou shalt
compass me about with songs of deliverance.
I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go: and I will
guide thee with mine eyes.
Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding: whose mouths
must be held with bit and bridle. lest they fall upon thee.
Great plagues remain for the ungodly: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord,
mercy embraceth him on every side.
Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord: and be joyful, all ye that are true
of heart.

<h3>Psalm 32</h3>
A psalm of David
REJOICE in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to be thankful.
Praise the Lord with harp: sing praises unto him with the lute, and instrument of
ten strings.
Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing praises lustily unto him with a good
courage.
For the word of the Lord is true: and all his works are faithful.
He loveth righteousness and judgement: the earth is full of the goodness of the
Lord.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the hosts of them by the
breath of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap: and layeth
up the deep, as in a treasure-house.
Let all the earth fear the Lord: stand in awe of him, all ye that dwell in the world.
For he spake, and it was done: he commanded and it stood fast.
The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: and maketh the devices
of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the counsels of princes.
The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever: and the thoughts of his heart from
generation to generation.
Blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord Jehovah: and blessed are the folk,
that he hath chosen to him to be his inheritance.
The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the children of men: from the
habitation of his dwelling he considereth all them that dwell on the earth.
He fashioneth all the hearts of them: and understandeth all their works.
There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host: neither is any
mighty man delivered by much strength.
A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man: neither shall he deliver any
man by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him: and upon them that put
their trust in his mercy.
To deliver their soul from death: and to feed them in the time of dearth.
Our soul hath patiently tarried for the Lord: for he is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in him: because we have hoped in his holy Name.
Let thy merciful kindness, O Lord, be upon us: like as we do put our trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 33</h3>
A psalm of David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech, and he was dismissed
and departed
I WILL alway give thanks unto the Lord: his praise shall ever be in my mouth.
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be
glad.
O praise the Lord with me: and let us magnify his Name together.
I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he delivered me out of all my fear.
They had an eye unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
ashamed.
Lo, the poor crieth, and the Lord heareth him: yea, and saveth him out of all his
troubles.
The angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him: and delivereth
them.
O taste, and see, how gracious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusteth in
him.
O fear the Lord, ye that are his saints: for they that fear him lack nothing.
The lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they who seek the Lord shall want no
manner of thing that is good.
Come, ye children, and hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
What man is he that lusteth to live: and would fain see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil: and thy lips, that they speak no guile.
Eschew evil, and do good: seek peace, and ensue it.
The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous: and his ears are open unto their
prayers.
The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil: to root out the
remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them: and delivereth them out of all
their troubles.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and will save such as be
of an humble spirit.
Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of all.
He keepeth all his bones: so that not one of them is broken.
But misfortune shall slay the ungodly: and they that hate the righteous shall be
desolate.
The Lord delivereth the souls of his servants: and all they that put their trust in
him shall not be destitute.

<h3>Psalm 34</h3>
A psalm of David
PLEAD thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: and fight thou
against them that fight against me.
Lay hand upon the shield and buckler: and stand up to help me.
Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto
my soul, I am thy salvation.
Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seek after my soul :let them be
turned back and brought to confusion, that imagine mischief for me.
Let them be as the dust before the wind: and the angel of the Lord scattering
them.
Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord persecute them.
For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause: yea, even
without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.
Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net, that he hath laid
privily, catch himself: that he may fall into his own mischief.
And, my soul, be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, who deliverest the poor from
him that is too strong for him: yea, the poor, and him that is in misery, from
him that spoileth him?
False witnesses did rise up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
They rewarded me evil for good: to the great discomfort of my soul.
Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with
fasting.: and my prayer shall turn into mine own bosom.
I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother: I went heavily,
as one that mourneth for his mother.
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the
very abjects came together against me unawares, making mouths at me,
and ceased not.
With the flatterers were busy mockers: who gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, how long wilt though look upon this: O deliver my soul from the calamities
which they bring on me, and my darling from the lions.
So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among
much people.
O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly: neither let them
wink with their eyes that they hate me without a cause.
And why? their communing is not for peace; but they imagine deceitful words
against them that are quiet in the land.
They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said: Fie on thee, fie on thee, we
saw it with our eyes.
This thou hast seen, O Lord: hold not thy tongue then, go not far from me, O
Lord.
Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel: avenge thou my cause, my God, and
my Lord.
Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness: and let them not
triumph over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, There, there, so would we have it: neither let
them say, We have devoured him.
Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at my trouble: let
them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that boast themselves against
me.
Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing: yea, let them say
alway, Blessed be the Lord, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
servant.
And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness: and of thy praise
all the day long.
<h3>Psalm 35</h3>
For the end. By David the servant of the Lord
MY HEART sheweth me the wickedness of the ungodly: that there is no fear of
God before his eyes.
For he flattereth himself in his own sight: until his abominable sin be found out.
The words of his mouth are unrighteous, and full of deceit: he hath left off to
behave himself wisely, and to do good.
He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good way:
neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.
Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth unto the heavens: and thy faithfulness unto the
clouds.
Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: thy judgments are like the
great deep.
Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast; How excellent is thy mercy, O God:
and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy
wings.
They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house: and thou shalt give
them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.
For with thee is the well of life: and in thy light shall we see light.
O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee: and thy
righteousness unto them that are true of heart.
O let not the foot of pride come against me: and let not the hand of the ungodly
cast me down.
There are they fallen, all that work wickedness: they are cast down, and shall not
be able to stand.

<h3>Psalm 36</h3>
A psalm of David
FRET not thyself because of the ungodly: neither be thou envious against the
evil-doers.
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass: and be withered even as the
green herb.
Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good: dwell in the land, and verily
thou shalt be fed.
Delight thou in the Lord: and he shall give thee thy heart's desire.
Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him: and he shall bring it to
pass.
He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light ; and thy just dealing as the
noon-day.
Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon him: but grieve not thyself at
him whose way doth prosper, against the man that doeth after evil
counsels.
Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: fret not thyself, else shalt thou be
moved to do evil.
Wicked doers shall be rooted out: and they that patiently abide the Lord, those
shall inherit the land.
Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: thou shalt look after his
place, and he shall be away.
But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth: and shall be refreshed in the
multitude of peace.
The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just: and gnasheth upon him with his
teeth.
The Lord shall laugh him to scorn: for he hath seen that his day is coming.
The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow: to cast down
the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of a right conversation.
Their sword shall go through their own heart: and their bow shall be broken.
A small thing that the righteous hath: is better than great riches of the ungodly.
For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken: and the Lord upholdeth the
righteous.
The Lord knoweth the days of the godly: and their inheritance shall endure for
ever.
They shall not be confounded in the perilous time: and in the days of dearth they
shall have enough.
As for the ungodly, they shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord shall consume
as the fat of lambs: yea, even as the smoke shall they consume away.
The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous is merciful and
liberal.
Such as are blessed of God shall possess the land: and they that are cursed of
him shall be rooted out.
The Lord ordereth a good man's going: and maketh his way acceptable to
himself.
Though he fall, he shall not be cast away: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
hand.
I have been young, and now am old: and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging their bread.
The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth: and his seed is blessed.
Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good: and dwell for evermore.
For the Lord loveth the thing that is right: he forsaketh not his that be godly, but
they are preserved for ever.
The unrighteous shall be punished: as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be
rooted out.
The righteous shall inherit the land: and dwell therein forever.
The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and his tongue will be talking
of judgement.
The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not slide.
The ungodly seeth the righteous: and seeketh occasion to slay him.
The Lord will not leave him in his hand: nor condemn him when he is judged.
Hope thou in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee, that thou
shalt possess the land: when the ungodly shall perish, thou shalt see it.
I myself have seen the ungodly in great power: and flourishing like a green baytree.
I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him, but his place could no where be
found.
Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right: for that shall bring a
man peace at the last.
As for the transgressors, they shall perish together: and the end of the ungodly
is, they shall be rooted out at the last.
But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord: who is also their strength
in the time of trouble.
And the Lord shall stand by them, and save them: he shall deliver them from the
ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him.

<h3>Psalm 37</h3>
A psalm of David . For remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day
PUT me not to rebuke, O Lord, in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy heavy
displeasure.
For thine arrows stick fast in me: and thy hand presseth me sore.
There is no health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure: neither is there any
rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.
For my wickednesses are gone over my head: and are like a sore burden, too
heavy for me to bear.
My wounds stink, and are corrupt: through my foolishness.
I am brought into so great trouble and misery: that I go mourning all the day
long.
For my loins are filled with a sore disease: and there is no whole part in my body.
I am feeble, and sore smitten: I have roared for the very disquietness of my
heart.
Lord, thou knowest all my desire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart panteth, my strength hath failed me: and the sight of mine eyes is gone
from me.
My lovers and my neighbours did stand looking upon my trouble: and my
kinsmen stood afar off.
They also that sought after my life laid snares for me: and they that went about
to do me evil talked of wickedness, and imagined deceit all the day long.
As for me I was like a deaf men, and heard not: and as one that is dumb, who
doth not open his mouth.
I became even as a man that heareth not: and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: thou shalt answer for me, O Lord my
God.
I have required that they, even mine enemies should not triumph over me: for
when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly against me.
And I, truly, am set in the plague: and my heaviness is ever in my sight.
For I will confess my wickedness: and be sorry for my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are mighty: and they that hate me wrongfully are
many in number.
They also that reward evil for good are against me: because I follow the thing
that good is.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me.
Haste thee to help me: O Lord God of my salvation.
<h3>Psalm 38</h3>
For the end. A song of David, for Idithun
I SAID, I will take heed to my ways: that I offend not in my tongue.
I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle: while the ungodly is in my sight.
I held my tongue, and spake nothing: I kept silence, yea, even from good words;
but it was pain and grief to me.
My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus musing the fire kindled: and at
the last I spake with my tongue;
Lord, let me know mine end, and the number of my days: that I may be certified
how long I have to live.
Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long: and mine age is even as
nothing in respect of thee; and verily every man living is altogether vanity.
For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth
up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.
And now, Lord, what is my hope: truly my hope is even in thee.
Deliver me from all mine offences: and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.
I became dumb, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doing.
Take thy plague away from me: I am even consumed by the means of thy heavy
hand.
When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to
consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man
therefore is but vanity.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with thine ears consider my calling: hold not thy
peace at my tears.
For I am a stranger with thee: and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength: before I go hence, and be no
more seen
<h3>Psalm 39</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
I WAITED patiently for the Lord: and he inclined unto me, and heard my calling.
He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay: and set my
feet upon the rock, and ordered my goings.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth: even a thanksgiving unto our God.
Many shall see it, and fear: and shall put their trust in the Lord.
Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the Lord: and turned not unto the
proud, and to such as go about with lies.
O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, like as be
also thy thoughts which are to us-ward: and yet there is no man that
ordereth them unto thee:
If I should declare them, and speak of them: they should be more than I am able
to express.
Sacrifice and meat-offering thou wouldest not: but mine ears hast thou opened.
Burnt-offerings, and sacrifice for sin, hast thou not required: then said I, Lo, I
come,
In the volume of the book it is written of me, that I should fulfil thy will, O my
God: I am content to do it; yea, thy law is within my heart.
I have declared thy righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I will not refrain
my lips, O Lord, and that thou knowest.
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart: my talk hath been of thy truth
and of thy salvation.
I have not kept back thy loving mercy and truth: from the great congregation.
Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord: let thy loving-kindness and thy
truth alway preserve me.
For innumerable troubles are come about me; my sins have taken such hold upon
me that I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the
hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.
O Lord, let it be thy pleasure to deliver me: make haste, O Lord, to help me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seek after my soul to
destroy it: let them be driven backward and put to rebuke, that wish me
evil.
Let them be desolate, and rewarded with shame: that say unto me, Fie upon
thee, fie upon thee.
Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let such as love thy
salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and needy: but the Lord careth for me.
Thou art my helper and redeemer: make no long tarrying, O my God.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 40</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
BLESSED is he that considereth the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him
in the time of trouble.
The Lord preserve him, and keep him alive, that he may be blessed upon earth:
and deliver not thou him into the will of his enemies.
The Lord comfort him, when he lieth sick upon his bed: make thou all his bed in
his sickness.
I said, Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies speak evil of me: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: and his heart conceiveth falsehood
within himself, and when he cometh forth he telleth it.
All mine enemies whisper together against me: even against me do they imagine
this evil.
Let the sentence of guiltiness proceed against him: and now that he lieth, let him
rise up no more.
Yea, even mine own familiar friend, whom I trusted: who did also eat of my
bread, hath laid great wait for me.
But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord: raise thou me up again, and I shall reward
them.
By this I know thou favourest me: that mine enemy doth not triumph against me.
And when I am in my health, thou upholdest me: and shalt set me before thy face
for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel: world without end. Amen.
<h3>Psalm 41</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
LIKE as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God: when shall I come to
appear before the presence of God?
My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where
is now thy God?
Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the
multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;
In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day.
Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted
within me?
Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his
countenance.
My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore will I remember thee concerning
the land of Jordan, and the little hill of Hermon.
One deep calleth another, because of the noise of the water-pipes: all thy waves
and storms are gone over me.
The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the day-time: and in the nightseason did I sing of him, and made my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast thou forgotten me: why go I
thus heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword: while mine enemies that trouble
me cast me in the teeth;
Namely, while they say daily unto me: Where is now thy God?
Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.
<h3>Psalm 42</h3>
A psalm of David
GIVE sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people:
O deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man.
For thou art the God of my strength, why hast thou put me from thee: and why
go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresseth me?
O send out thy light and thy truth, that they may lead me: and bring me unto thy
holy hill, and to thy dwelling.
And that I may go unto the altar of God, even unto the God of my joy and
gladness: and upon the harp I will give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou so heavy, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within me?
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 43</h3>
For the end. A psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core
WE HAVE heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us: what thou hast
done in their time of old;
How thou hast driven out the heathen with thy hand, and planted them in: how
thou hast destroyed the nations and cast them out.
For they gat not the land in possession through their own sword: neither was it
their own arm that helped them;
But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance: because
thou hadst a favour unto them.
Thou art my King, O God: send help unto Jacob.
Through thee will we overthrow our enemies: and in thy Name will we tread
them under, that rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow: it is not my sword that shall help me;
But it is thou that savest us from our enemies: and puttest them to confusion that
hate us.
We make our boast of God all day long: and will praise thy Name for ever.
But now thou art far off, and puttest us to confusion: and goest not forth with our
armies.
Thou makest us to turn our backs upon our enemies: so that they which hate us
spoil our goods.
Thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep: and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Thou sellest thy people for nought: and takest no money for them.
Thou makest us to be rebuked of our neighbours: to be laughed to scorn, and had
in derision of them that are round about us.
Thou makest us to be a by-word among the heathen: and that the people shake
their heads at us.
My confusion is daily before me: and the shame of my face hath covered me;
For the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer: for the enemy and avenger.
And though all this be come upon us, yet do we not forget thee: nor behave
ourselves frowardly in thy covenant.
Our heart is not turned back: neither our steps gone out of thy way;
No, not when thou hast smitten us into the place of dragons: and covered us with
the shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the Name of our God, and holden up our hands to any
strange God: shall not God search it out? for he knoweth the very secrets of
the heart.
For thy sake also are we killed all the day long: and are counted as sheep
appointed to be slain.
Up, Lord, why sleepest thou: awake, and be not absent from us for ever.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face: and forgettest our misery and trouble?
For our soul is brought low, even unto the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the
ground.
Arise, and help us: and deliver us for thy mercy's sake.
<h3>Psalm 44</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses by the sons of Core, for instruction. A Song concerning the
beloved
MY HEART is inditing of a good matter: I speak of the thing which I have made
unto the King.
My tongue is the pen: of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, because God
hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most Mighty: according to thy
worship and renown.
Good luck have thou with thine honour: ride on, because of the word of truth , of
meekness, and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible
things.
Thy arrows are very sharp, and the people shall be subdued unto thee: even in
the midst among the King's enemies.
Thy seat, O God, endureth for ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, even thy God,
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia: out of the ivory palaces,
whereby they have made thee glad.
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did
stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, incline thine ear ; forget also thine own
people, and thy father's house.
So shall the King have pleasure in thy beauty: for his is thy Lord God, and
worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift: like as the rich also among
the people shall make their supplication before thee.
The King's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work: the virgins that be
her fellows shall bear her company, and shall be brought unto thee.
With joy and gladness shall they be brought: and shall enter into the King's
palace.
Instead of thy fathers thou shalt have children: whom thou mayest make princes
in all lands.
I will remember thy Name from one generation to another: therefore shall the
people give thanks unto thee, world without end.
<h3>Psalm 45</h3>
For the end. For the sons of Core; a psalm concerning secret things
GOD is our hope and strength: a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be moved: and though the hills be
carried into the midst of the sea;
Though the waters thereof rage and swell: and though the mountains shake at
the tempest of the same.
The rivers of the flood thereof shall make glad the city of God: the holy place of
the tabernacle of the most Highest.
God is in the midst of her, therefore shall she not be removed: God shall help
her, and that right early.
The heathen make much ado, and the kingdoms are moved: but God hath shewed
his voice, and the earth shall melt away.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.
O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord: what destruction he hath
brought upon the earth.
He maketh wars to cease in all the world: he breaketh the bow, and knappeth the
spear in sunder, and burneth the chariots in the fire.
Be still then, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I
will be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our refuge.

<h3>Psalm 46</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O CLAP your hand together, all ye people: O sing unto God with the voice of
melody.
For the Lord is high, and to be feared: he is the great King upon all the earth.
He shall subdue the people under us: and the nations under our feet.
He shall choose out an heritage for us: even the worship of Jacob, whom he
loved.
God is gone up with a merry noise: and the Lord with the sound of the trump.
O sing praises, sing praises unto our God: O sing praises, sing praises unto our
King.
For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon his holy seat.
The princes of the people are joined unto the people of the God of Abraham: for
God, which is very high exalted, doth defend the earth, as it were with a
shield.
<h3>Psalm 47</h3>
A psalm of praise for the sons of Core on the second day of the week
GREAT is the Lord, and highly to be praised: in the city of our God, even upon his
holy hill.
The hill of Sion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth: upon the north-side
lieth the city of the great King; God is well known in her palaces as a sure
refuge.
For lo, the kings of the earth: are gathered, and gone by together.
They marvelled to see such things: they were astonished, and suddenly cast
down.
Fear came there upon them, and sorrow: as upon a woman in her travail.
Thou shalt break the ships of the sea: through the east wind.
Like as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the
city of our God: God upholdeth the same for ever.
We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God: in the midst of thy temple.
O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's end: thy right
hand is full of righteousness.
Let the mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Judah be glad: because of thy
judgements.
Walk about Sion, and go round about her: and tell the towers thereof.
Mark well her bulwarks, set up her houses: that ye may tell them that come
after.
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he shall be our guide unto death.
<h3>Psalm 48</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
O HEAR ye this, all ye people: ponder it with your ears, all ye that dwell in the
world;
High and low, rich and poor: one with another.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom: and my heart shall muse of understanding.
I will incline mine ear to the parable: and shew my dark speech upon the harp.
Wherefore should I fear in the days of wickedness: and when the wickedness of
my heels compasseth me round about?
There be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches.
But no man may deliver his brother: nor make agreement unto God for him;
For it cost more to redeem their souls: so that he must let that alone for ever;
Yea, though he live long: and see not the grave.
For he seeth that wise men also die, and perish together: as well as the ignorant
and foolish, and leave their riches for other.
And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever: and that their
dwelling-places shall endure from one generation to another; and call the
lands after their own names.
Nevertheless, man will not abide in honour: seeing that he may be compared
unto the beasts that perish; this is the way of them.
This is their foolishness: and their posterity praise their saying.
They lie in the hell like sheep, death gnaweth upon them, and the righteous shall
have domination over them in the morning: their beauty shall consume in
the sepulchre out of their dwelling.
But God hath delivered my soul from the place of hell: for he shall receive me.
Be not thou afraid, though one be made rich: or if the glory of his house be
increased.
For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dieth: neither shall his pomp
follow him.
For while he lived, he counted himself an happy man: and so long as thou doest
well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.
He shall follow the generation of his fathers: and shall never see light.
Man being in honour hath no understanding: but is compared unto the beasts
that perish.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 49</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
THE Lord, even the most mighty God, hath spoken: and called the world, from
the rising up of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Out of Sion hath God appeared: in perfect beauty.
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: there shall go before him a
consuming fire, and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up round about him.
He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth, that he may judge his people.
Gather my saints together unto me: those that have made a covenant with me
with sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is Judge himself.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak: I myself will testify against thee, O Israel;
for I am God, even thy God.
I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt-offerings:
because they were not alway before me.
I will take no bullock out of thine house: nor he-goat out of thy folds.
For all the beasts of the forest are mine: and so are the cattle upon a thousand
hills.
I know all the fowls upon the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are in
my sight.
If I be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the whole world is mine, and all that is
therein.
Thinkest thou that I will eat bulls' flesh: and drink the blood of goats?
Offer unto God thanksgiving: and pay thy vows unto the most Highest.
And call upon me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee, and thou shalt praise
me.
But unto the ungodly said God: Why dost thou preach my laws, and takest my
covenant in thy mouth;
Whereas thou hatest to be reformed: and has cast my words behind thee?
When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him: and hast been partaker
with the adulterers.
Thou hast let thy mouth speak wickedness: and with thy tongue thou hast set
forth deceit.
Thou satest, and spakest against thy brother: yea, and hast slandered thine own
mother's son.
These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest
wickedly, that I am even such a one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and
set before thee the things that thou hast done.
O consider this, ye that forget God: lest I pluck you away, and there be none to
deliver you.
Whoso offereth me thanks and praise, he honoureth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation right will I shew the salvation of God.
<h3>Psalm 50</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone in to
Bathsheba
HAVE mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: according to the
multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.
Wash me throughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me.
Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou
mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: and in sin hath my mother conceived me.
But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand
wisdom secretly.
Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice.
Turn thy face from my sins: and put out all my misdeeds.
Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
O give me the comfort of thy help again: and stablish me with thy free Spirit.
Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health: and
my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.
Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord: and my mouth shall shew thy praise.
For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee: but thou delightest not in
burnt-offerings.
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit: a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt
thou not despise.
O be favourable and gracious unto Sion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burntofferings and oblations: then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine
altar.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 51</h3>
For the end. A psalm of instruction by David, when Doeg the Idumean came and told Saul that
David had gone to the house of Abimelech
WHY boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant: that thou canst do mischief;
Whereas the goodness of God: endureth yet daily?
Thy tongue imagineth wickedness: and with lies thou cuttest like a sharp rasor.
Thou hast loved unrighteousness more then goodness: and to talk of lies more
than righteousness.
Thou hast loved to speak all words that may do hurt: O thou false tongue.
Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever: he shall take thee, and pluck thee out
of thy dwelling, and root thee out of the land of the living.
The righteous also shall see this, and fear: and shall laugh him to scorn;
Lo, this is the man that took not God for his strength: but trusted unto the
multitude of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
As for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: my trust is in the
tender mercy of God for ever and ever.
I will always give thanks unto thee for that thou hast done: and I will hope in thy
Name, for thy saints like it well.
<h3>Psalm 52</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David upon Maeleth, of instruction
THE foolish body hath said in his heart: There is no God.
Corrupt are they, and become abominable in their wickedness: there is none that
doeth good.
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there were any
that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is also none that doeth good, no not one.
Are not they without understanding, that work wickedness: eating up my people
as if they would eat bread? they have not called upon God.
They were afraid where no fear was: for God hath broken the bones of him that
besieged thee; thou hast put them to confusion, because God hath despised
them.
O that the salvation were given unto Israel out of Sion: O that the Lord would
deliver his people out of captivity!
Then should Jacob rejoice: and Israel should be right glad.
<h3>Psalm 53</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of instruction by David. When the Ziphites came and said to Saul,
Lo, is not David hid with us?
SAVE me, O God, for thy Name's sake: and avenge me in thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God: and hearken unto the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me: and tyrants, which have not God before
their eyes, seek after my soul.
Behold, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: destroy thou them in thy truth.
An offering of a free heart will I give thee, and praise thy Name, O Lord: because
it is so comfortable.
For he hath delivered me out of all my trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire
upon mine enemies.
<h3>Psalm 54</h3>
For the end. Among hymns of instruction by David
HEAR my prayer, O God: and hide not thyself from my petition.
Take heed unto me, and hear me: how I mourn in my prayer, and am vexed.
The enemy crieth so, and the ungodly cometh on so fast: for they are minded to
do me some mischief; so maliciously are they set against me.
My heart is disquieted within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me: and an horrible dread hath
overwhelmed me.
And I said, O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I flee away, and be at
rest.
Lo, then would I get me away far off: and remain in the wilderness.
I would make haste to escape: because of the stormy wind and tempest.
Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide them: for I have spied unrighteousness
and strife in the city.
Day and night they go about within the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow
are in the midst of it.
Wickedness is therein: deceit and guile go not out of their streets.
For it is not an open enemy, that hath done me this dishonour: for then I could
have borne it.
Neither was it mine adversary, that did magnify himself against me: for then
peradventure I would have hid myself from him.
But it was even thou, my companion: my guide, and mine own familiar friend.
We took sweet counsel together: and walked in the house of God as friends.
Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for
wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord shall save me.
In the evening, and morning, and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly: and
he shall hear my voice.
It is he that hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
for there were many with me.
Yea, even God, that endureth for ever, shall hear me, and bring them down: for
they will not turn, nor fear God.
He laid his hands upon such as be at peace with him: and he brake his covenant.
The words of his mouth were softer than butter, having war in his heart: his
words were smoother than oil, and yet be they very swords.
O cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: and shall not suffer
the righteous to fall for ever.
And as for them: thou, O God, shalt bring them into the pit of destruction.
The blood-thirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days:
nevertheless, my trust shall be in thee, O Lord.

<h3>Psalm 55</h3>
For the end. Concerning the people that were removed from the sanctuary. By David for a
memorial, when the Philistines caught him in Gath
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, for man goeth about to devour me: he is daily
fighting, and troubling me.
Mine enemies are daily in hand to swallow me up: for they be many that fight
against me, O thou most Highest.
Nevertheless, though I am sometime afraid: yet put I my trust in thee.
I will praise God, because of his word: I have put my trust in God, and will not
fear what flesh can do unto me.
They daily mistake my words: all that they imagine is to do me evil.
They hold all together, and keep themselves close: and mark my steps, when
they lay wait for my soul.
Shall they escape for their wickedness: thou, O God, in thy displeasure shalt cast
them down.
Thou tellest my flittings; put my tears into thy bottle: are not these things noted
in thy book?
Whensoever I call upon thee, then shall mine enemies be put to flight: this I
know; for God is on my side.
In God's word I will rejoice: in the Lord's word will I comfort me.
Yea, in God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
Unto thee, O God, will I pay my vows: unto thee will I give thanks.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling: that I may
walk before God in the light of the living.
<h3>Psalm 56</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David, for a memorial. When he fled from the presence of Saul to
the cave
BE MERCIFUL unto me, O God, be merciful unto me, for my soul trusteth in
thee: and under the shadow of thy wings shall be my refuge, until this
tyranny be over-past.
I will call unto the most high God: even unto the God that shall perform the
cause which I have in hand.
He shall send from heaven: and save me from the reproof of him that would eat
me up.
God shall send forth his mercy and truth: my soul is among lions.
And I lie even among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are
spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
They have laid a net for my feet, and pressed down my soul: they have digged a
pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, and give praise.
Awake up, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee
among the nations.
For the greatness of thy mercy reacheth unto the heavens: and thy truth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 57</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial
ARE your minds set upon righteousness, O ye congregation: and do ye judge the
thing that is right, O ye sons of men?
Yea, ye imagine mischief in your heart upon the earth: and your hands deal with
wickedness.
The ungodly are froward, even from their mother's womb: as soon as they are
born, they go astray, and speak lies.
They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent: even like the deaf adder that
stoppeth her ears.
Which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer: charm he never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; smite the jaw-bones of the lions, O
Lord: let them fall away like water that runneth apace; and when they
shoot their arrows let them be rooted out.
Let them consume away like a snail, and be like the untimely fruit of a woman:
and let them not see the sun.
Or ever your pots be made hot with thorns: so let indignation vex him, even as a
thing that is raw.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his
footsteps in the blood of the ungodly.
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: doubtless
there is a God that judgeth the earth.

<h3>Psalm 58</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: By David for a memorial, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill
him
DELIVER me from mine enemies, O God: defend me from them that rise up
against me.
O deliver me from the wicked doers: and save me from the blood-thirsty men.
For lo, they lie waiting for my soul: the mighty men are gathered against me,
without any offence or fault of me, O Lord.
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: arise thou therefore to help
me, and behold.
Stand up, O Lord God of hosts, thou God of Israel, to visit all the heathen: and be
not merciful unto them that offend of malicious wickedness.
They go to and fro in the evening: they grin like a dog, and run about through the
city.
Behold, they speak with their mouth, and swords are in their lips: for who doth
hear?
But thou. O Lord, shalt have them in derision: and thou shalt laugh all the
heathen to scorn.
My strength will I ascribe unto thee: for thou art the God of my refuge.
God sheweth me his goodness plenteously: and God shall let me see my desire
upon mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest my people forget it: but scatter them abroad among the
people, and put them down, O Lord, our defence.
For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, they shall be taken in
their pride: and why? their preaching is of cursing and lies.
Consume them in thy wrath, consume them, that they may perish: and know that
it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.
And in the evening they will return: grin like a dog, and will go about the city.
They will run here and there for meat: and grudge if they be not satisfied.
As for me, I will sing of thy power, and will praise thy mercy betimes in the
morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
trouble.
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for thou, O God, art my refuge, and my
merciful God.
<h3>Psalm 59</h3>
For the end. For them that shall yet be changed. For an inscription by David for instruction.
When he had burned Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syrian Sobal, and Joab had returned and smitten
twelve thousand in the Valley of Salt
O GOD, thou hast cast us out, and scattered us abroad: thou hast also been
displeased; O turn thee unto us again.
Thou hast moved the land, and divided it: heal the sores thereof, for it shaketh.
Thou hast shewed thy people heavy things: thou hast given us a drink of deadly
wine.
Thou hast given a token for such as fear thee: that they may triumph because of
the truth.
Therefore were thy beloved delivered: help me with thy right hand, and hear me.
God hath spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice, and divide Sichem: and mete out
the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head;
Judah is my law-giver.
Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, be thou glad
of me.
Who will lead me into the strong city: who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou cast us out, O God: wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
O be thou our help in trouble: for vain is the help of man.
Through God will we do great acts: for it is he that shall tread down our enemies.
<h3>Psalm 60</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns of David
HEAR my crying, O God: give ear unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth will I call unto thee: when my heart is in heaviness.
O set me up upon the rock that is higher than I: for thou hast been my hope, and
a strong tower for me against the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: and my trust shall be under the covering of
thy wings.
For thou, O Lord, hast heard my desires: and hast given an heritage unto those
that fear thy Name.
Thou shalt grant the King a long life: that his years may endure throughout all
generations.
He shall dwell before God for ever: O prepare thy loving mercy and faithfulness,
that they may preserve him.
So will I always sing praise unto thy Name: that I may daily perform my vows.

<h3>Psalm 61</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David for Idithun
MY SOUL truly waiteth still upon God: for of him cometh my salvation.
He verily is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
greatly fall.
How long will ye imagine mischief against every man: ye shall be slain all the
sort of you; yea, as a tottering wall shall ye be, and like a broken hedge.
Their device is only how to put him out whom God will exalt: their delight is in
lies; they give good words with their mouth, but curse with their heart.
Nevertheless, my soul, wait thou still upon God: for my hope is in him.
He truly is my strength and my salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not
fall.
In God is my health, and my glory: the rock of my might, and in God is my trust.
O put your trust in him alway, ye people: pour out your hearts before him, for
God is our hope.
As for the children of men, they are but vanity: the children of men are deceitful
upon the weights, they are altogether lighter than vanity itself.
O trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselves unto vanity: if riches
increase, set not your heart upon them.
God spake once, and twice I have also heard the same: that power belongeth
unto God;
And that thou, Lord, art merciful: for thou rewardest every man according to his
work.
<h3>Psalm 62</h3>
A psalm of David. When he was in the wilderness of Idumea
O GOD, thou art my God: early will I seek thee.
My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh also longeth after thee: in a barren and dry
land where no water is.
Thus have I looked for thee in holiness: that I might behold thy power and glory.
For thy loving-kindness is better than the life itself: my lips shall praise thee.
As long as I live will I magnify thee on this manner: and lift up my hands in thy
Name.
My soul shall be satisfied, even as it were with marrow and fatness: when my
mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.
Have I not remembered thee in my bed: and thought upon thee when I was
waking?
Because thou hast been my helper: therefore under the shadow of thy wings will
I rejoice.
My soul hangeth upon thee: thy right hand hath upholden me.
These also that seek the hurt of my soul: they shall go under the earth.
Let them fall upon the edge of the sword: that they may be a portion for foxes.
But the King shall rejoice in God; all they also that swear by him shall be
commended: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
<h3>Psalm 63</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the gathering together of the froward: and from the insurrection of
wicked doers;
Who have whet their tongue like a sword: and shoot out their arrows, even bitter
words;
That they may privily shoot at him that is perfect: suddenly do they hit him, and
fear not.
They encourage themselves in mischief: and commune among themselves how
they may lay snares, and say that no man shall see them.
They imagine wickedness, and practise it: that they keep secret among
themselves, every man in the deep of his heart.
But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow: that they shall be
wounded.
Yea, their own tongues shall make them fall insomuch that whoso seeth them
shall laugh them to scorn.
And all men that see it shall say, This hath God done: for they shall perceive that
it is his work.
The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord, and put his trust in him: and all they that
are true of heart shall be glad.

Enliven me, O Theotokos who hast given birth to the hypostatic Life of all, that with piety I may hymn thee, the all-immaculate one. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> I am held fast in the depths of sin O Savior, * and am overwhelmed by the sea of life, * but as Jonah was delivered from the sea-monster, * so also deliver me from the passions, * and save me.  Like the Canaanite woman of old I cry unto Thee: O Son of God, have mercy and pity on me! For my soul suffereth in its grievous deeds, and desireth not to come to its senses. The tempest of countless passions vexeth me. As once Thou didst rebuke the sea and save Thy holy disciples, O Jesus Christ, so raise me up and save me. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The incorporeal angelic choirs marveled at your bodily endurance, O honored spiritual athletes, and they praised Him Who granteth you power and the reward for your toils. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Soaked by the streams of your own blood, your eyes plucked out, chilled by the perishing cold, O martyrs, ye passed over to the warmth of life, hymning Christ. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Like a table, O all-hymned one, thou didst hold the mystical Bread, of Whom those who eat will no longer hunger, knowing thee to be truly the Mother and Nourisher of Christ, the God of all. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Whirled about in the abyss of sin, * I appeal to the unfathomable abyss of Thy compassion: * Raise me up from corruption, O God. O voice who proclaimed the Word, accepting the cries of us all, ask that He grant forgiveness of sins unto those who hymn Him with faith. Heal the broken state of my soul, loose the burden of my sins, and by thy supplications save me who am beyond hope, O blessed Forerunner. Entreat Jesus, Whom thou didst baptize with thy hand, O most glorious Forerunner, that from the hand of sin He deliver me who ever lift up my hands unto Him. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> I am stuck fast in the slumber of slothfulness, and the sleep of sin weigheth heavily upon my heart. But by thy vigilant mediation raise me up, O most pure one, and save me. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Like unto the Cherubim, the Children rejoicing in the furnace sang: * 'Blessed art Thou O God, * for in truth Thou hast brought this judgment upon us * because of our sins, * Thou art supremely praised and glorified throughout all ages'. I have rejected Thy laws and made myself subject to irrational lusts, doing unseemly things, O Christ, for I have become vain in my mindlessness more than any other men on earth. But in Thy loving-kindness leave me not to perish, O Savior. Behold, I have been conceived in iniquities, O Lord: like David I cry out, like the harlot I weep, for like an offensive servant I have offended Thee, the only good God. But in Thy tender compassion leave me not to perish, O Savior. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The martyric assembly of the passion-bearers struggled and were crowned as martyrs by the life-bearing right hand of God; for they truly loved God, Who created all things by His word. And rejoicing now in the heavens, they enjoy a divine inheritance. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Their eyes plucked out, their hands and feet severed, the right glorious ones ran right speedily to the heavenly course, treading on the feet of the one enemy. By their supplications, O Word, save all who glorify Thee. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The cherubim, the seraphim, the thrones, authorities and dominions ever glorify and hymn thy birthgiving, which transcends understanding, O all-hymned Mary, for thou alone hast given birth to God in the flesh. Him do thou entreat, O pure one, that we who honor thee with love may be saved. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The godless order of the lawless tyrant * fanned the roaring flame; * but Christ bedewed the God-fearing children with the Spirit, * therefore He is blessed and supremely exalted. Having hewn down the wounds of my passion-plagued heart with thine axe of repentance, O Forerunner, plant in their stead divine dispassion and the most pure fear of God, which remove me from all evil. As thou didst baptize in the streams of the Jordan the Lord Who covereth His chambers with the waters, beseech Him ever to give the water of divine compunction to mine eyes, O glorious Forerunner. Having preached the Lamb of God, Who taketh away the sin of the world, O glorious Forerunner, beseech Him to deliver me from the lot of the goats, and to number me among the lambs at His right hand. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> A barren womb bore thee, O Virgin, who didst bear in thy womb the Word incarnate, Whom the great Forerunner, rejoicing, acknowledged with godly leaps as the all-holy and seedless Fruit, bowing down before Him. </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Unto Him Who of old prefigured the miracle of the Virgin, * unto Moses in the burning bush * on Mount Sinai, * let us sing, bless and supremely exult throughout all ages. That Thou mightest deify us, in Thy mercy Thou didst become incarnate. This I have failed to understood, slave that I am to pleasures. But in Thy goodness convert me, O Christ, Thou salvation of all. O Word, good Shepherd, turn Thou and save my wretched soul, which hath become lost in the mountains of transgression, and let not the deceiving foe utterly slay me. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> “Let us stand manfully together!” the comely spiritual athletes cried one to another as they were cruelly wounded. “Behold, Christ extendeth crowns of victory to us throughout all ages!” </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With your mighty pangs, as with strong cords, ye choked the serpent who desired to deceive you with evil machinations; and ye have been revealed to be inheritors of the food of paradise. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> That God might deify us, He took flesh from thy pure blood and became a man, O Virgin Theotokos. Him do thou ever entreat on behalf of those who honor thee. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> In Babylon, the activity of the fire was once divided, * for, by the command of God it consumed the Chaldeans, * but bedewed the faithful, who chant: * Bless ye the Lord, all ye works of the Lord!  Extend thy right hand unto me who lie on the ground, O Forerunner who, extending thy right hand, didst wash the Undefiled One in the waters. Deliver me from bodily corruption, cleansing me wholly with repentance; and save me. As thou hast time to repent, O my soul, shake off the heavy sleep of slothfulness, and hasten to keep watch, crying out to thy Master: Have pity on me, O Thou Who art full of loving-kindness, by the prayers of him who baptized Thee. The torrents of the passions and the waters of evil have entered in unto my soul, O blessed Forerunner. Hasten thou to quickly rescue me, O thou who in the river’s streams washed the most tranquil Deep of dispassion. Alas for me who have done much evil! Woe is me, who alone have angered the supremely good God! O thou who didst baptize Christ, help me, and by thy mediations grant me the remission of my transgressions and the annulment of my debts. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O thou who gavest. birth in the flesh unto the Most High God, raise me up from the mire of the passions which sorely trouble me, O most pure one, and enrich me with divine virtues, for I am grievously and wholly impoverished, that, saved, I may hymn thee. We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the </p><p><i class="note">refrain:</i> “More honorable than the cherubim ...”<i class="note"> Prostrations.</i> </p><h3>Ode IX</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of Repentance </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Who born on Earth hath ever heard of, or beheld, * a Virgin miraculously conceiving in her womb, * and painlessly giving birth to a child, * wherefore we magnify thee O pure Virgin. O how awesome is the tribunal at which I shall await judgment, O Christ; yet I in nowise feel terror thereof, spending all my time in idleness. But convert me, O only Creator, Who converted the sinful Manasseh. Staunch the torrents of my boundless evils, I cry unto Thee, O Christ, granting me outpourings of tears which wash away the defilement in which I wallowed in mine insanity; and in Thy mercy save me, O Thou Who didst save the harlot who repented with all her soul. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Shining forth upon us like the sun, the splendid memory of the divine passion-bearers sheddeth light upon all the ends of the earth, and with the divine Spirit dispels the gloom of the madness of idolatry and the darkness of the soul-corrupting passions. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The honored regiment, the victorious army, the chosen company, the assembly of the holy martyrs, the divine choir have united themselves to the choirs of the incorporeal ones. By their prayers, O Christ, grant us all to share in Thy kingdom. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> With the radiant effulgence of Him Who shone forth upon us from thy womb, destroying the night of ungodliness, O Mary, Virgin Mother, enlighten all who honor thee with faith; and at the hour of condemnation, deliver them from the darkness which is devoid of light. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Forerunner  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The beginningless Son of God the Father and the Lord, * became flesh from the Virgin, * to give light to those in darkness, * and to gather the dispersed. * Wherefore we magnify the all-hymned Theotokos! Deliver me from the mire of sin, O only sinless and greatly merciful Lord, through the prayers of the Baptist who proclaimed Thee, the Lamb of God, to the whole world, as He Who taketh away the sins of all. Having thee as a fragrant rose, as a right redolent cypress tree, as a never-fading lily, as precious myrrh, O Forerunner of the Lord, running to thy protection I am delivered from the stench of my deeds by thy supplications. O all-blessed one, make me who have become barren through my fruitless deeds, ever fruitful in the virtues, and a child of the Lord, a sharer in the divine kingdom and a dweller with the council of the saints. From heaven grant remission of evils, correction of life and deliverance from transgressions unto us who love thee, who honor thee with love and join chorus in thy divine temple, O Forerunner of the Lord. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thou didst pay homage unto Him Who was borne in the womb of the Mother of God and holdeth all things in His hand, O prophet. With her pray that my lowly soul may be saved, for every day it falleth into many offenses.

<h3>Psalm 64</h3>
For the end. A psalm and song of David
THOU, O God, art praised in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed in
Jerusalem.
Thou that hearest the prayer: unto thee shall all flesh come.
My misdeeds prevail against me: O be thou merciful unto our sins.
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and receivest unto thee: he shall dwell
in thy court, and shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house, even of
thy holy temple.
Thou shalt shew us wonderful things in thy righteousness, O God of our
salvation: thou that art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that remain in the broad sea.
Who in his strength setteth fast the mountains: and is girded about with power.
Who stilleth the raging of the sea: and the noise of his waves, and the madness of
the people.
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth shall be afraid at thy
tokens: thou that makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
praise thee.
Thou visitest the earth, and blessest it: thou makest it very plenteous.
The river of God is full of water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest
for the earth.
Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof: thou
makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness: and thy clouds drop fatness.
They shall drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness: and the little hills shall
rejoice on every side.
The folds shall be full of sheep: the valleys also shall stand so thick with corn,
that they shall laugh and sing.
<h3>Psalm 65</h3>
For the end. A song of a plasm of resurrection
O BE joyful in God, all ye lands: sing praises unto the honour of his Name, make
his praise to be glorious.
Say unto God, O how wonderful art thou in thy works: through the greatness of
thy power shall thine enemies be found liars unto thee.
For all the world shall worship thee: sing of thee, and praise thy Name.
O come hither, and behold the works of God: how wonderful he is in his doing
toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land: so that they went through the water on foot;
there did we rejoice thereof.
He ruleth with his power for ever; his eyes behold the people: and such as will
not believe shall not be able to exalt themselves.
O praise our God, ye people: and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
Who holdeth our soul in life: and suffereth not our feet to slip.
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou also hast tried us, like as silver is tried.
Thou broughtest us into the snare: and laidest trouble upon our loins.
Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads: we went through fire and water, and
thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: and will pay thee my vows, which I
promised with my lips, and spake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.
I will offer unto thee fat burnt-sacrifices, with the incense of rams: I will offer
bullocks and goats.
O come hither, and hearken, all ye that fear God: and I will tell you what he hath
done for my soul.
I called unto him with my mouth: and gave him praises with my tongue.
If I incline unto wickedness with mine heart: the Lord will not hear me.
But God hath heard me: and considered the voice of my prayer.
Praised be God, who hath not cast out my prayer: nor turned his mercy from me.
<h3>Psalm 66</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns
GOD be merciful unto us, and bless us: and shew us the light of his countenance,
and be merciful unto us:
That thy way may be known upon earth: thy saving health among all nations.
Let the people praise thee, O God: yea, let all the people praise thee.
O let the nations rejoice and be glad: for thou shalt judge the folk righteously,
and govern the nations upon earth.
Let the people praise thee, O God: let all the people praise thee.
Then shall the earth bring forth her increase: and God, even our own God, shall
give us his blessing.
God shall bless us: and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 67</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song of David
LET God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee
before him.
Like as the smoke vanisheth, so shalt thou drive them away: and like as wax
melteth at the fire, so let the ungodly perish at the presence of God.
But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God: let them also be merry and
joyful .
O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name: magnify him that rideth upon
the heavens, as it were upon an horse; praise him in his Name JAH, and
rejoice before him.
He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows: even God
in his holy habitation.
He is the God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house, and bringeth the
prisoners out of captivity: but letteth the runagates continue in scarceness.
O God, when thou wentest forth before the people: when thou wentest through
the wilderness;
The earth shook, and the heavens dropped at the presence of God: even as Sinai
also was moved at the presence of God, who is the God of Israel.
Thou, O God, sentest a gracious rain upon thine inheritance: and refreshedst it
when it was weary.
Thy congregation shall dwell therein: for thou, O God, hast of thy goodness
prepared for the poor.
The Lord gave the word: great was the company of the preachers.
Kings with their armies did flee, and were discomfited: and they of the household
divided the spoil.
Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove: that
is covered with silver wings, and her feathers like gold.
When the Almighty scattered kings for their sake: then were they as white as
snow in Salmon.
As the hill of Basan, so is God's hill: even an high hill, as the hill of Basan.
Why hop ye so, ye high hills? this is God's hill, in the which it pleaseth him to
dwell: yea, the Lord will abide in it for ever.
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: and the Lord
is among them, as in the holy place of Sinai.
Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, and received gifts for
men: yea, even for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among
them.
Praised be the Lord daily: even the God who helpeth us, and poureth his benefits
upon us.
He is our God, even the God of whom cometh salvation: God is the Lord, by
whom we escape death.
God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalp of such a one as
goeth on still in his wickedness.
The Lord hath said, I will bring my people again, as I did from Basan: mine own
will I bring again, as I did sometime from the deep of the sea.
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies: and that the tongue of
thy dogs may be red through the same.
It is well seen, O God, how thou goest: how thou, my God and King, goest in the
sanctuary.
The singers go before, the minstrels follow after: in the midst are the damsels
playing with the timbrels.
Give thanks, O Israel, unto God the Lord in the congregations: from the ground
of the heart.
There is little Benjamin their ruler, and the princes of Judah their counsel: the
princes of Zabulon, and the princes of Nephthali.
Thy God hath sent forth strength for thee: stablish the thing, O God, that thou
hast wrought in us,
For thy temple's sake at Jerusalem: so shall kings bring presents unto thee.
When the company of the spear-men, and multitude of the mighty are scattered
abroad among the beasts of the people, so that they humbly bring pieces of
silver: and when he hath scattered the people that delight in war;
Then shall the princes come out of Eqypt: the Morians' land shall soon stretch
our her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, O ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord;
Who sitteth in the heavens over all from the beginning: lo, he doth send out his
voice, yea, and that a mighty voice.
Ascribe ye the power to God over Israel: his worship and strength is in the
clouds.
O God, wonderful art thou in thy holy places: even the God of Israel, he will give
strength and power unto his people; blessed be God.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 68</h3>
For the end. A Psalm of David for alternate verses
SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.
I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is: I am come into deep waters, so
that the floods run over me.
I am weary of crying; my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for waiting so long
upon my God.
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: they that
are mine enemies, and would destroy me guiltless, are mighty.
I paid them the things that I never took: God, thou knowest my simpleness, and
my faults are not hid from thee.
Let not them that trust in thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my cause:
let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O Lord God of
Israel.
And why? for thy sake have I suffered reproof: shame hath covered my face.
I am become a stranger unto my brethren: even an alien unto my mother's
children.
For the zeal of thine house hath even eaten me: and the rebukes of them that
rebuked thee are fallen upon me.
I wept, and chastened myself with fasting: and that was turned to my reproof.
I put on sackcloth also: and they jested upon me.
They that sit in the gate speak against me: and the drunkards make songs upon
me.
But, Lord, I make my prayer unto thee: in an acceptable time.
Hear me, O God, in the multitude of thy mercy: even in the truth of thy salvation.
Take me out of the mire, that I sink not: O let me be delivered from them that
hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Let not the water-flood drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up: and let
not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving-kindness is comfortable: turn thee unto me
according to the multitude of thy mercies.
And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: O haste thee, and
hear me.
Draw nigh unto my soul, and save it: O deliver me, because of mine enemies.
Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are
all in thy sight.
Thy rebuke hath broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to
have pity on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me.
They gave me gall to eat: and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
Let their table be made a snare to take themselves withal: and let the things that
should have been for their wealth be unto them an occasion of falling.
Let their eyes be blinded, that they see not: and ever bow thou down their backs.
Pour out thine indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful displeasure take hold
of them.
Let their habitation be void: and no man to dwell in their tents.
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten: and they talk how they may vex
them whom thou hast wounded.
Let them fall from one wickedness to another: and not come into thy
righteousness.
Let them be wiped out of the book of the living: and not be written among the
righteous.
As for me, when I am poor and in heaviness: thy help, O God, shall lift me up.
I will praise the Name of God with a song: and magnify it with thanksgiving.
This also shall please the Lord: better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
The humble shall consider this, and be glad: seek ye after God, and your soul
shall live.
For the Lord heareth the poor: and despiseth not his prisoners.
Let heaven and earth praise him: the sea, and all that moveth therein.
For God will save Sion, and build the cities of Judah: that men may dwell there,
and have it in possession.
The posterity also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his Name
shall dwell therein.
<h3>Psalm 69</h3>
For the end. By David for a remembrance; that the Lord may save me
HASTE thee, O God, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned
backward and put to confusion that wish me evil.
Let them for their reward be soon brought to shame: that cry over me, There,
there.
But let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad in thee: and let all such as
delight in thy salvation say alway, The Lord be praised.
As for me, I am poor and in misery: haste thee unto me, O God.
Thou art my helper and my redeemer: O Lord, make no long tarrying.

<h3>Psalm 70</h3>
By David. A psalm sung by the sons of Jonadab and the first that were taken captive
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion: but rid
me and deliver me in thy righteousness, incline thine ear unto me, and save
me.
Be thou my strong hold, whereunto I may alway resort: thou hast promised to
help me, for thou art my house of defence and my castle.
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly: out of the hand of the
unrighteous and cruel man.
For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope, even from
my youth.
Through thee have I been holden up ever since I was born: thou art he that took
me out of my mother's womb; my praise shall be always of thee.
I am become as it were a monster unto many: but my sure trust is in thee.
O let my mouth be filled with thy praise: that I may sing of thy glory and honour
all the day long.
Cast me not away in the time of age: forsake me not when my strength faileth
me.
For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait for my soul take their
counsel together, saying: God hath forsaken him; persecute him, and take
him, for there is none to deliver him.
Go not far from me, O God: my God, haste thee to help me.
Let them be confounded and perish that are against my soul: let them be covered
with shame and dishonour that seek to do me evil.
As for me, I will patiently abide alway: and will praise thee more and more.
My mouth shall daily speak of thy righteousness and salvation: for I know no end
thereof.
I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy
righteousness only.
Thou, O God, hast taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I tell of
thy wondrous works.
Forsake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray-headed: until I have
shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to all them that
are yet for to come.
Thy righteousness, O God, is very high: and great things are they that thou hast
done; O God, who is like unto thee?
O what great troubles and adversities hast thou shewed me, and yet didst thou
turn and refresh me: yea, and broughtest me from the deep of the earth
again.
Thou hast brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every side.
Therefore will I praise thee and thy faithfulness, O God, playing upon an
instrument of musick: unto thee will I sing upon the harp, O thou Holy One
of Israel.
My lips will be fain when I sing unto thee: and so will my soul whom thou hast
delivered.
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are
confounded and brought unto shame that seek to do me evil.
<h3>Psalm 71</h3>
For Solomon
GIVE the King thy judgements, O God: and thy righteousness unto the King's
son.
Then shall he judge thy people according unto right: and defend the poor.
The mountains also shall bring peace: and the little hills righteousness unto the
people.
He shall keep the simple folk by their right: defend the children of the poor, and
punish the wrong-doer.
They shall fear thee, as long as the sun and moon endureth: from one generation
to another.
He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool: even as the drops that
water the earth.
In his time shall the righteous flourish: yea, and abundance of peace, so long as
the moon endureth.
His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other: and from the flood unto
the world's end.
They that dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him: his enemies shall lick
the dust.
The kings of Tharsis and of the isles shall give presents: the kings of Arabia and
Saba shall bring gifts.
All kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall do him service.
For he shall deliver the poor when he crieth: the needy also, and him that hath
no helper.
He shall be favourable to the simple and needy: and shall preserve the souls of
the poor.
He shall deliver their souls from falsehood and wrong: and dear shall their blood
be in his sight.
He shall live, and unto him shall be given of the gold of Arabia: prayer shall be
made ever unto him, and daily shall he be praised.
There shall be an heap of corn in the earth, high upon the hills: his fruit shall
shake like Libanus, and shall be green in the city like grass upon the earth.
His Name shall endure for ever; his Name shall remain under the sun among the
posterities: which shall be blessed through him; and all the heathen shall
praise him.
Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel: which only doeth wondrous
things;
And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever: and all the earth shall be filled
with his majesty. Amen, Amen.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 72</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
TRULY God is loving unto Israel: even unto such as are of a clean heart.
Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone: my treadings had well-nigh slipt.
And why? I was grieved at the wicked: I do also see the ungodly in such
prosperity.
For they are in no peril of death: but are lusty and strong.
They come in no misfortune like other folk: neither are they plagued like other
men.
And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride: and overwhelmed with
cruelty.
Their eyes swell with fatness: and they do even what they lust.
They corrupt other, and speak of wicked blasphemy: their talking is against the
most High.
For they stretch forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their tongue goeth
through the world.
Therefore fall the people unto them: and thereout suck they no small advantage.
Tush, say they, how should God perceive it: is there knowledge in the most High?
Lo, these are the ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in
possession: and I said, Then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed
mine hands in innocency.
All the day long have I been punished: and chastened every morning.
Yea, and I had almost said even as they: but lo, then I should have condemned
the generation of thy children.
Then thought I to understand this: but it was too hard for me,
Until I went into the sanctuary of God: then understood I the end of these men;
Namely, how thou dost set them in slippery places: and castest them down, and
destroyest them.
O how suddenly do they consume: perish, and come to a fearful end!
Yea, even like as a dream when one awaketh: so shalt thou make their image to
vanish out of the city.
Thus my heart was grieved: and it went even through my reins.
So foolish was I, and ignorant: even as it were a beast before thee.
Nevertheless, I am alway by thee: for thou hast holden me by my right hand.
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel: and after that receive me with glory.
Whom have I in heaven but thee: and there is none upon earth that I desire in
comparison of thee.
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my
portion for ever.
For lo, they that forsake thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that
commit fornication against thee.
But it is good for me to hold me fast by God, to put my trust in the Lord God: and
to speak of all thy works in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
<h3>Psalm 73</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
O GOD, wherefore art thou absent from us so long: why is thy wrath so hot
against the sheep of thy pasture?
O think upon thy congregation: whom thou hast purchased and redeemed of old.
Think upon the tribe of thine inheritance: and mount Sion, wherein thou hast
dwelt.
Lift up thy feet, that thou mayest utterly destroy every enemy: which hath done
evil in thy sanctuary.
Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy congregations: and set up their
banners for tokens.
He that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees: was known to bring it to an
excellent work.
But now they break down all the carved work thereof: with axes and hammers.
They have set fire upon thy holy places: and have defiled the dwelling-place of
thy Name, even unto the ground.
Yea, they said in their hearts, Let us make havoc of them altogether: thus have
they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.
We see not our tokens, there is not one prophet more: no, not one is there among
us, that understandeth any more.
O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonour: how long shall the enemy
blaspheme thy Name, for ever?
Why withdrawest thou thy hand: why pluckest thou not thy right hand out of thy
bosom to consume the enemy?
For God is my King of old: the help that is done upon earth he doeth it himself.
Thou didst divide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the
dragons in the waters.
Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces: and gavest him to be meat for the
people in the wilderness.
Thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks: thou driedst up
mighty waters.
The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy hath rebuked: and how the foolish
people hath blasphemed thy Name.
O deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the enemies: and
forget not the congregation of the poor for ever.
Look upon the covenant: for all the earth is full of darkness and cruel
habitations.
O let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the poor and needy give praise
unto thy Name.
Arise, O God, maintain thine own cause: remember how the foolish man
blasphemeth thee daily.
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the presumption of them that hate thee
increaseth ever more and more.

<h3>Psalm 74</h3>
For the end. Destroy not: A psalm of a song for Asaph
UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks: yea, unto thee do we give thanks.
Thy Name also is so nigh: and that do thy wondrous works declare.
When I receive the congregation: I shall judge according unto right.
The earth is weak, and all the inhabiters thereof: I bear up the pillars of it.
I said unto the fools, Deal not so madly: and to the ungodly, Set not up your horn.
Set not up your horn on high: and speak not with a stiff neck.
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west: nor yet from the
south.
And why? God is the Judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixed,
and he poureth out of the same.
As for the dregs thereof: all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them, and suck
them out.
But I will talk of the God of Jacob: and praise him for ever.
All the horns of the ungodly also will I break: and the horns of the righteous shall
be exalted.
<h3>Psalm 75</h3>
For the end. Among the hymns, a psalm for Asaph: A song for the Assyrian
IN JEWRY is God known: his Name is great in Israel.
At Salem is his tabernacle: and his dwelling in Sion.
There brake he the arrows of the bow: the shield, the sword, and the battle.
Thou art of more honour and might: than the hills of the robbers.
The proud are robbed, they have slept their sleep: and all the men whose hands
were mighty have found nothing.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob: both the chariot and horse are fallen.
Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when thou art
angry?
Thou didst cause thy judgement to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled,
and was still;
When God arose to judgement: and to help all the meek upon earth.
The fierceness of man shall turn to thy praise: and the fierceness of them shalt
thou refrain.
Promise unto the Lord your God, and keep it, all ye that are round about him:
bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
He shall refrain the spirit of princes: and is wonderful among the kings of the
earth.
<h3>Psalm 76</h3>
For the end. For Idithun, a psalm of Asaph
I WILL cry unto God with my voice: even unto God will I cry with my voice, and
he shall hearken unto me.
In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran and ceased not in the
night-season ; my soul refused comfort.
When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God: when my heart is vexed, I will
complain.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble, that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old: and the years that are past.
I call to remembrance my song: and in the night I commune with mine own
heart, and search out my spirits.
Will the Lord absent himself for ever: and will he be no more intreated?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly to an end for
evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his loving-kindness in
displeasure?
And I said, It is mine own infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right
hand of the most Highest.
I will remember the works of the Lord: and call to mind thy wonders of old time.
I will think also of all thy works: and my talking shall be of thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is holy: who is so great a God as our God?
Thou art the God that doeth wonders: and hast declared thy power among the
people.
Thou hast mightily delivered thy people: even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid: the depths
also were troubled.
The clouds poured out water, the air thundered: and thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder was heard round about: the lightnings shone upon the
ground: the earth was moved, and shook withal.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters: and thy footsteps are
not known.
Thou leddest thy people like sheep: by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<h3>Psalm 77</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Asaph
HEAR my law, O my people: incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hard sentences of old;
Which we have heard and known: and such as our fathers have told us;
That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to come: but
to shew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he
hath done.
He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law: which he commanded our
forefathers to teach their children;
That their posterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn;
To the intent that when they came up: they might shew their children the same;
That they might put their trust in God: and not to forget the works of God, but to
keep his commandments;
And not to be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation: a
generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit cleaveth not
stedfastly unto God;
Like as the children of Ephraim: who being harnessed, and carrying bows,
turned themselves back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his law;
But forgat what he had done: and the wonderful works that he had shewed for
them.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt:
even in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea, and let them go through: he made the waters to stand on an
heap.
In the day-time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night through with a
light of fire.
He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness: and gave them drink thereof, as it had
been out of the great depth.
He brought waters out of the stony rock: so that it gushed out like the rivers.
Yet for all this they sinned more against him: and provoked the most Highest in
the wilderness.
They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their lust.
They spake against God also, saying: Shall God prepare a table in the
wilderness?
He smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
flowed withal: but can he give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?
When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: so the fire was kindled in Jacob, and
there came up heavy displeasure against Israel;
Because they believed not in God: and put not their trust in his help.
So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.
He rained down manna also upon them for to eat: and gave them food from
heaven.
So man did eat angels' food: for he sent them meat enough.
He caused the east-wind to blow under heaven: and through his power he
brought in the south-west-wind.
He rained flesh upon them as thick as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand
of the sea.
He let it fall among their tents: even round about their habitation.
So they did eat and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire: they were
not disappointed of their lust.
But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon
them, and slew the wealthiest of them: yea, and smote down the chosen
men that were in Israel.
But for all this they sinned yet more: and believed not his wondrous works.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years in trouble.
When he slew them, they sought him: and turned them early, and inquired after
God.
And they remembered that God was their strength: and that the high God was
their redeemer.
Nevertheless, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and dissembled with him
in their tongue.
For their heart was not whole with him: neither continued they stedfast in his
covenant.
But he was so merciful, that he forgave their misdeeds: and destroyed them not.
Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not suffer his whole
displeasure to arise.
For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were even a wind that
passeth away, and cometh not again.
Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderness: and grieved him in the
desert.
They turned back, and tempted God: and moved the Holy One in Israel.
They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered them from the
hand of the enemy;
How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
He turned their waters into blood: so that they might not drink of the rivers.
He sent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to destroy them.
He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar: and their labour unto the grasshopper.
He destroyed their vines with hail-stones: and their mulberry-trees with the frost.
He smote their cattle also with hail-stones: and their flocks with hot
thunderbolts.
He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure and trouble:
and sent evil angels among them.
He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death: but gave
their life over to the pestilence;
And smote all the first-born in Egypt: the most principal and mightiest in the
dwellings of Ham.
But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep: and carried them in the
wilderness like a flock.
He brought them out safely, that they should not fear: and overwhelmed their
enemies with the sea.
And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary: even to his mountain
which he purchased with his right hand.
He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land to be divided among
them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not his testimonies;
But turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers: starting aside like a
broken bow.
For they grieved him with their hill-altars: and provoked him to displeasure with
their images.
When God heard this, he was wroth: and took sore displeasure at Israel.
So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that he had pitched
among men.
He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with his inheritance.
The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not given to
marriage.
Their priests were slain with the sword: and there were no widows to make
lamentation.
So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep: and like a giant refreshed with wine.
He smote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a perpetual shame.
He refused the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
But chose the tribe of Judah: even the hill of Sion which he loved.
And there he built his temple on high: and laid the foundation of it like the
ground which he hath made continually.
He chose David also his servant: and took him away from the sheep-folds.
As he was following the ewes great with young ones he took him: that he might
feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
So he fed them with a faithful and true heart: and ruled them prudently with all
his power.

<h3>Psalm 78</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thy holy temple have they
defiled, and made Jerusalem an heap of stones.
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the
air: and the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the land.
Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem: and there was
no man to bury them.
We are become an open shame to our enemies: a very scorn and derision unto
them that are round about us.
Lord, how long wilt thou be angry: shall thy jealousy burn like fire for ever?
Pour out thine indignation upon the heathen that have not known thee: and upon
the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.
For they have devoured Jacob: and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not our old sins, but have mercy upon us, and that soon: for we are
come to great misery.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy Name: O deliver us, and be
merciful unto our sins, for thy Name's sake.
Wherefore do the heathen say: Where is now their God?
O let the vengeance of thy servants' blood that is shed: be openly shewed upon
the heathen in our sight.
O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to the
greatness of thy power, preserve thou those that are appointed to die.
And for the blasphemy wherewith our neighbours have blasphemed thee: reward
thou them , O Lord, seven-fold into their bosom.
So we, that are thy people, and sheep of thy pasture, shall give thee thanks for
ever: and will alway be shewing forth thy praise from generation to
generation.
<h3>Psalm 79</h3>
For the end. For alternate verses. A testimony for Asaph: a Psalm concerning the Assyrian
HEAR, O thou Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep: shew
thyself also, thou that sittest upon the cherubims.
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses: stir up thy strength, and come, and
help us.
Turn us again, O God: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.
O Lord God of hosts: how long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth?
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears: and givest them plenteousness of
tears to drink.
Thou hast made us a very strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh us
to scorn.
Turn us again, thou God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we shall
be whole.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and
planted it.
Thou madest room for it: and when it had taken root it filled the land.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it: and the boughs thereof were like
the goodly cedar-trees.
She stretched out her branches unto the sea: and her boughs unto the river.
Why hast thou then broken down her hedge: that all they that go by pluck off her
grapes?
The wild boar out of the wood doth root it up: and the wild beasts of the field
devour it.
Turn thee again, thou God of hosts, look down from heaven: behold, and visit this
vine;
And the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted: and the branch
that thou madest so strong for thyself.
It is burnt with fire, and cut down: and they shall perish at the rebuke of thy
countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man, whom
thou madest so strong for thine own self.
And so will not we go back from thee: O let us live, and we shall call upon thy
Name.
Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts: shew the light of thy countenance, and we
shall be whole.
<h3>Psalm 80</h3>
For the end. A psalm for Asaph, concerning the winepresses
SING we merrily unto God our strength: make a cheerful noise unto the God of
Jacob.
Take the psalm, bring hither the tabret: the merry harp with the lute.
Blow up the trumpet in the new-moon: even in the time appointed, and upon our
solemn feast-day.
For this was made a statute for Israel: and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony: when he came out of the land of
Egypt, and had heard a strange language.
I eased his shoulder from the burden: and his hands were delivered from making
the pots.
Thou calledst upon me in troubles, and I delivered thee: and heard thee what
time as the storm fell upon thee.
I proved thee also: at the waters of strife.
Hear, O my people, and I will assure thee, O Israel: if thou wilt hearken unto me,
There shall no strange god be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any other god.
I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy
mouth wide, and I shall fill it.
But my people would not hear my voice: and Israel would not obey me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts: and let them follow their own
imaginations.
O that my people would have hearkened unto me: for if Israel had walked in my
ways,
I should soon have put down their enemies: and turned my hand against their
adversaries.
The haters of the Lord should have been found liars: but their time should have
endured for ever.
He should have fed them also with the finest wheat-flour: and with honey out of
the stony rock should I have satisfied thee.

<h3>Psalm 81</h3>
A psalm for Asaph
GOD standeth in the congregation of princes: he is a Judge among gods.
How long will ye give wrong judgement: and accept the persons of the ungodly?
Defend the poor and fatherless: see that such as are in need and necessity have
right.
Deliver the outcast and poor: save them from the hand of the ungodly.
They will not be learned nor understand, but walk on still in darkness: all the
foundations of the earth are out of course.
I have said, Ye are gods: and ye are all the children of the most Highest.
But ye shall die like men: and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, and judge thou the earth: for thou shalt take all heathen to thine
inheritance.
<h3>Psalm 82</h3>
A song of a psalm for Asaph
HOLD not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence: refrain not thyself, O God.
For lo, thine enemies make a murmuring: and they that hate thee have lift up
their head.
They have imagined craftily against thy people: and taken counsel against thy
secret ones.
They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people:
and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
For they have cast their heads together with one consent: and are confederate
against thee;
The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismaelites: the Moabites and
Hagarenes;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek: the Philistines, with them that dwell at Tyre.
Assur also is joined with them: and have holpen the children of Lot.
But do thou to them as unto the Madianites: unto Sisera, and unto Jabin at the
brook of Kison;
Who perished at Endor: and became as the dung of the earth.
Make them and their princes like Oreb and Zeb: yea, make all their princes like
as Zeba and Salmana;
Who say, Let us take to ourselves: the houses of God in possession.
O my God, make them like unto a wheel: and as the stubble before the wind;
Like as the fire that burneth up the wood: and as the flame that consumeth the
mountains.
Persecute them even so with thy tempest: and make them afraid with thy storm.
Make their faces ashamed, O Lord: that they may seek thy Name.
Let them be confounded and vexed ever more and more: let them be put to
shame, and perish.
And they shall know that thou, whose Name is Jehovah: art only the most Highest
over all the earth.
<h3>Psalm 83</h3>
For the end. A song for the sons of Core, concerning the winepresses
O HOW amiable are thy dwellings: thou Lord of hosts!
My soul hath a desire and longing to enter into the courts of the Lord: my heart
and my flesh rejoice in the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest where she may
lay her young: even thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be alway praising thee.
Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are thy ways.
Who going through the vale of misery use it for a well: and the pools are filled
with water.
They will go from strength to strength: and unto the God of gods appeareth every
one of them in Sion.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer :hearken, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our defender: and look upon the face of thine Anointed.
For one day in thy courts: is better than a thousand.
I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God: than to dwell in the tents
of ungodliness.
For the Lord God is a light and defence: the Lord will give grace and worship,
and no good thing shall he withhold from them that live a godly life.
O Lord God of hosts: blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 84</h3>
For the end. A psalm for the sons of Core
LORD, thou art become gracious unto thy land: thou hast turned away the
captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the offence of thy people: and covered all their sins.
Thou hast taken away all thy displeasure: and turned thyself from thy wrathful
indignation.
Turn us then, O God our Saviour: and let thine anger cease from us.
Wilt thou be displeased at us for ever: and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from
one generation to another?
Wilt thou not turn again, and quicken us: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
Shew us thy mercy, O Lord: and grant us thy salvation.
I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak
peace unto his people, and to his saints, that they turn not again.
For his salvation is nigh them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each
other.
Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness hath looked down from
heaven.
Yea, the Lord shall shew loving-kindness: and our land shall give her increase.
Righteousness shall go before him: and he shall direct his going in the way.

Thou couldst not bear to see that which Thou didst create with Thine own hands be lost and slain, wherefore Thou didst stretch out Thy hands upon the Tree, O Word; and by the Tree bring life unto him who died of old. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O friends of Christ, fervent helpers of all, precious flowers, exeedingly adorned vessels of the Spirit, wise passion-bearers: ye are worthily called blessed. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The choir of Thy holy spiritual athletes suffered lawfully, O only Bestower of the law; putting the iniquitous to shame by Thy power and, having finished their race, as martyrs, they received crowns. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thou wast revealed to be incorrupt even after giving birth, O pure one, for from thee God was born in the flesh. Yet upon seeing Him crucified, thou didst cry out in pain from thy womb, unable to bear the sight. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> O Lord, Bestower of light and Creator of the ages: * guide us in the light of Thy commandments, * for we know none other God than Thee.  O Birthgiver of God, we, the faithful, have come to know the Son Who was born, incarnate, from thee without seed: true God and man by nature. Wherefore, we glorify thee. Ever fleeing with faith beneath thy protection and help, O most pure Virgin, because of thee we are delivered from every grievous circumstance. Deliver us from temptations, from the tempest of thoughts, from all wrath and every sin, from famine and plague, and from everlasting torment, O most pure Virgin. As thou art our intercessor, salvation and the hope of Christians, O Lady, save those who ever hymn thee with faith and love, O all-hymned Virgin. </p><h3>Ode VI</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> From within the sea monster Jonah cried unto the Lord: * “Lead me up from the abyss of Hades, I pray Thee; * for with a voice of praise as to my Redeemer, * in the spirit of truth * I offer myself to Thee.”  Jacob once laid his hands upon the heads of his grandsons, prefiguring the Cross on which Thou, O Word, didst stretch out Thy hands; and Thou didst deliver mankind from the hand of the lying adversary, O Christ. When Thou wast willingly crucified, O Christ our King, reigning sin was over-thrown; and Adam, who once, of old, was driven out of paradise, was brought to dwell therein again, hymning Thee. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> With unwavering hearts let us hymn the truly beloved martyrs of the Lord, sacred and beautiful in their wounds, who are adorned with celestial majesty. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Keeping their lamps burning continuously, the divine martyrs filled them abundantly with their own blood, and, rejoicing, have obtained entry into the bridal-chamber of God. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> O all-hymned one, we hymn thee as the one who gave birth to the all-hymned God, Who on the Tree destroyed the adverse foe, delivering from corruption those who hymn His sufferings. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Whirled about in the abyss of sin, * I appeal to the unfathomable abyss of Thy compassion: * Raise me up from corruption, O God. He Who of His own will created all things deigned to make His abode within the womb of her who knew not wedlock; and, in that He is full of loving-kindness, He enriched with incorruption those Sick with corruption. O most immaculate One, who art more exalted and holy than the hosts on high, in a supra-natural manner thou didst contain within thy womb the uncontainable Word. O Lady, guide me who have strayed from the path of life unto the ways of repentance, for I often wander lost amid the trackless wilderness of sin. Disdain not the entreaties of us, thy servants, who place our hope in thee, O pure one; for thou art the refuge and cleansing of the souls of all, O Lady. </p><h3>Ode VII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The godless order of the lawless tyrant * fanned the roaring flame; * but Christ bedewed the God-fearing children with the Spirit, * therefore He is blessed and supremely exalted. The sword which before was unsheathed hath now been withdrawn for me since Thou, O compassionate Lord, wast lifted up upon the Cross and pierced with a spear; wherefore, finding dispassion through thy precious suffering, I magnify thee. The serpent who was lifted up by Moses on a tree prefigured the divine lifting up of Christ, Who slew the lying serpent granting life unto all mankind, who became dead through disobedience. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> By divine communion ye became children of the beginningless Father, O saints, emulating the most pure sufferings of the Son Who is equally without beginning; wherefore, He calleth you brethren and heirs to His kingdom. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Hung upon crosses like their Master, pierced by spears, run through with swords, cast into fire and water, and broken on the wheel, the God-bearing martyrs rejoiced. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> As the pure one beheld hanging on the Tree the ripe Grapes which she had produced without being cultivated, the pure one cried aloud: O my sweet child, pour forth the juice which removes the drunkenness of the passions!” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The godless order of the lawless tyrant ..., O Lady, thou who art my might, hymn and salvation, famous aid and unassailable bulwark; vanquish the demons who war against me and who ever seek to slay me. <i class="note">Twice.</i></p><p> From Thy virginal blood thou hast given flesh unto God Who hath deified mankind, O Virgin; wherefore, by thy supplications deliver me who have been defiled by the passions and made corrupt by the wiles of the enemy. The furnace, O all-immaculate one, prefigured thy birthgiving; for the flickering fire did not consume the youths, just as the Fire of the Godhead did not consume thy womb. Wherefore, we beseech thee: Deliver thy servants from everlasting fire. </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> In Babylon, the activity of the fire was once divided, * for, by the command of God it consumed the Chaldeans, * but bedewed the faithful, who chant: * Bless ye the Lord, all ye works of the Lord!  By the blood which flowed from Thine incorrupt side creation hath been sanctified, O Long-suffering One, the rivers of polytheism have been dried up, and showers of piety have appeared ending the drought of delusions. The sun was appalled by Thy crucifixion and hid its rays; the rocks split asunder, and Hades, below, was terrified; and the souls of the righteous leapt up, trusting in their ultimate deliverance, O Word. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The remains of the passion-bearers pour forth healings upon the faithful, ever healing the ill affects of all but incurable diseases; for “Wondrous art. Thou in Thy holy martyrs!” we cry, O Lord. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O passion-bearers, ye steadfastly braved the mouths of wild beasts, the boiling of cauldrons, freezing cold and ice, the burden of the heat of day, and violent death; wherefore, ye are glorified with Christ. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> Thy Son, the Invisible One, desiring to receive flesh from thy womb, O divinely joyous one, became visible, and accepted crucifixion, and though He was called accursed, He hath delivered all from the curse. </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos  </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> In Babylon, the activity of the fire ..., O unblemished Ewe-lamb, who hast given birth unto the Lamb of God, the living and abundant salvation of us mortals: Spurn me not who cry out: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord!

O pure one, from thy virginal womb thou hast given birth to the living Water, and poured forth remission upon the faithful from thy well-spring of healings; wherefore, we all cry aloud: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! Thou gavest rise to the ripe Grapes of life, O pure one; for thou art the vine which sweeteneth the earth with good things, and hymning thee, we cry aloud: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord!

<h3>Psalm 85</h3>
A prayer of David
BOW down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor, and in misery.
Preserve thou my soul, for I am holy: my God, save thy servant that putteth his
trust in thee.
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I will call daily upon thee.
Comfort the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
For thou, Lord, art good and gracious: and of great mercy unto all them that call
upon thee.
Give ear, Lord, unto my prayer: and ponder the voice of my humble desires.
In the time of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou hearest me.
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord: there is not one that can do
as thou doest.
All nations whom thou hadst made shall come and worship thee, O Lord: and
shall glorify thy Name.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in thy truth: O knit my heart unto
thee, that I may fear thy Name.
I will thank thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and will praise thy Name for
evermore.
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the
nethermost hell.
O God, the proud are risen against me: and the congregations of naughty men
have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before their eyes.
But thou, O Lord God, art full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, plenteous
in goodness and truth.
O turn thee then unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength unto thy
servant, and help the son of thine handmaid.
Shew some token upon me for good, that they who hate me may see it and be
ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
<h3>Psalm 86</h3>
A psalm of a song for the sons of Core
HER foundations are upon the holy hills: the Lord loveth the gates of Sion more
than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Very excellent things are spoken of thee: thou city of God.
I will think upon Rahab and Babylon: with them that know me.
Behold ye the Philistines also: and they of Tyre, with the Morians; lo, there was
he born.
And of Sion it shall be reported that he was born in her: and the most High shall
stablish her.
The Lord shall rehearse it when he writeth up the people: that he was born
there.
The singers also and trumpeters shall he rehearse: All my fresh springs shall be
in thee.
<h3>Psalm 87</h3>
A song of a psalm for the sons of Core. For the end. Upon Maeleth, for responsive strains.
Concerning instruction for Æman the Israelite
O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: O let my
prayer enter into thy presence, incline thine ear unto my calling.
For my soul is full of trouble: and my life draweth nigh unto hell.
I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit: and I have been even as a
man that hath no strength.
Free among the dead, like unto them that are wounded, and lie in the grave: who
are out of remembrance, and are cut away from thy hand.
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit: in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
Thine indignation lieth hard upon me: and thou hast vexed me with all thy
storms.
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me: and made me to be
abhorred of them.
I am so fast in prison: that I cannot get forth.
My sight faileth for very trouble: Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have
stretched forth my hands unto thee.
Dost thou shew wonders among the dead: or shall the dead rise up again, and
praise thee?
Shall thy loving-kindness be shewed in the grave: or thy faithfulness in
destruction?
Shall thy wondrous works be known in the dark: and thy righteousness in the
land where all things are forgotten?
Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: and early shall my prayer come before thee.
Lord, why abhorrest thou my soul: and hidest thou thy face from me?
I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the point to die: even from my youth
up thy terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me: and the fear of thee hath undone me.
They came round about me daily like water: and compassed me together on
every side.
My lovers and friends hast thou put away from me: and hid mine acquaintance
out of my sight.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 88</h3>
A psalm of instruction for Ætham the Israelite
MY SONG shall be alway of the loving-kindness of the Lord: with my mouth will I
ever be shewing thy truth from one generation to another.
For I have said, Mercy shall be set up for ever: thy truth shalt thou stablish in the
heavens.
I have made a covenant with my chosen: I have sworn unto David my servant;
Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and set up thy throne from one generation to
another.
O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and thy truth in the
congregation of the saints.
For who is he among the clouds: that shall be compared unto the Lord?
And what is he among the gods: that shall be like unto the Lord?
God is very greatly to be feared in the council of the saints: and to be had in
reverence of all them that are round about him.
O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto thee: thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on
every side.
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: thou stillest the waves thereof when they arise.
Thou hast subdued Egypt, and destroyed it: thou hast scattered thine enemies
abroad with thy mighty arm.
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast laid the foundation of
the round world, and all that therein is.
Thou hast made the north and the south: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy
Name.
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
Righteousness and equity are the habitation of thy seat: mercy and truth shall go
before thy face.
Blessed is the people, O Lord, that can rejoice in thee: they shall walk in the light
of thy countenance.
Their delight shall be daily in thy Name: and in thy righteousness shall they
make their boast.
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy loving-kindness thou shalt lift
up our horns.
For the Lord is our defence: the Holy One of Israel is our King.
Thou spakest sometime in visions unto thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help
upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
I have found David my servant: with my holy oil have I anointed him.
My hand shall hold him fast: and my arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not be able to do him violence: the son of wickedness shall not
hurt him.
I will smite down his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.
My truth also and my mercy shall be with him: and in my Name shall his horn be
exalted.
I will set his dominion also in the sea: and his right hand in the floods.
He shall call me, Thou art my Father: my God, and my strong salvation.
And I will make him my first-born: higher than the kings of the earth.
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast with
him.
His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the days of
heaven.
But if his children forsake my law: and walk not in my judgements;
If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments: I will visit their
offences with the rod, and their sin with scourges.
Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my
truth to fail.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: I
have sworn once by my holiness, that I will not fail David.
His seed shall endure for ever: and his seat is like as the sun before me.
He shall stand fast for evermore as the moon: and as the faithful witness in
heaven.
But thou hast abhorred and forsaken thine Anointed: and art displeased at him.
Thou hast broken the covenant of thy servant: and cast his crown to the ground.
Thou hast overthrown all his hedges: and broken down his strong holds.
All they that go by spoil him: and he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of his enemies: and made all his adversaries to
rejoice.
Thou hast taken away the edge of his sword: and givest him not victory in the
battle.
Thou hast put out his glory: and cast his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: and covered him with dishonour.
Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself, for ever: and shall thy wrath burn like fire?
O remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men for
nought?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death: and shall he deliver his soul
from the hand of hell?
Lord, where are thy old loving-kindnesses: which thou swarest unto David in thy
truth?
Remember, Lord, the rebuke that thy servants have: and how I do bear in my
bosom the rebukes of many people.
Wherewith thine enemies have blasphemed thee, and slandered the footsteps of
thine Anointed: Praised be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 89</h3>
A prayer of Moses the man of God
LORD, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were
made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye children of
men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past as a
watch in the night.
As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut down,
dried up and withered.
For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in the light of thy
countenance.
For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our years to an end, as
it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong
that they come to fourscore years: yet is their strength then but labour and
sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.
But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man feareth,
so is thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be glad all the
days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us: and for the years
wherein we have suffered adversity.
Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou the work
of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handywork.
<h3>Psalm 90</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
WHOSO dwelleth under the defence of the most High: shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty..
I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my strong hold: my God, in him
will I trust.
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noisome
pestilence.
He shall defend thee under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers:
his faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by
day;
For the pestilence that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness that destroyeth
in the noon-day.
A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall
not come nigh thee.
Yea, with thine eyes shalt thou behold: and see the reward of the ungodly.
For thou, Lord, art my hope: thou hast set thine house of defence very high.
There shall no evil happen unto thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee: to keep thee in all thy ways.
They shall bear thee in their hands: that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou
tread under thy feet.
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him
up, because he hath known my Name.
He shall call upon me, and I will hear him: yea, I am with him in trouble; I will
deliver him, and bring him to honour.
With long life will I satisfy him: and shew him my salvation.

        </p><h3>THE PROPHECY OF ISAIAH </h3><p>Thus saith the Lord: Comfort ye, comfort ye My people, saith the God. Speak ye,  priests, unto the heart of Jerusalem, cry unto her that her humiliation is at an end,  since her iniquity is pardoned, for she hath received of the Lord’s hand double for her  sins. The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord,  make straight the paths for our God. Get thee up into the high mountain, O Zion,  that bringest good tidings; lift up thy voice with strength, O Jerusalem, that bringest  good tidings, lift it up, be not afraid: I am the Lord God, I will hear the poor of Israel  and will not forsake them, but will cause rivers to flow in high places and fountains in  the midst of the fields. I will turn the wilderness into meadow and the dry land into  water-springs. Let heaven above rejoice and let clouds sprinkle down righteousness;  let the earth shine and let mercy shoot forth and let righteousness spring up together.  With a voice of singing declare ye, and let it be heard, utter it even to the end of the  earth, say ye: The Lord hath redeemed His servant Jacob, and if they thirst in the  wilderness, He will cause water to flow out of the rock for them. Sing, O barren one,  thou that didst not bear, break forth into singing and cry aloud, thou that didst not  travail, for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife.  </p><h3>THE PROPHECY OF MALACHI  </h3><p>Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Behold I will send My messenger before Thy  countenance, and he shall prepare the way before Thee. And the Lord, Whom ye  seek, shall suddenly come to His temple, but who may abide the day of His coming?  for He shall come like a refiner’s fire and like fuller’s soap, and He shall purify by  consuming and purging as gold and silver. And He shall come unto you for judgment,  and will be a swift witness against the evil ones, and against the adulterers, and against  false swearers, and against those that deprive the hireling of his wages, and against  those that oppress the widows and push away the Fatherless, and that turn aside the  stranger from his right, and fear not Him, with the Lord Almighty, for I am the Lord  your God and I will not change. And ye the sons of Jacob are gone away from the law  and have not kept it. Wherefore return unto Me and I will return unto you, saith the  Lord Almighty, and all nations shall call you blessed. Learn ye that I am the Lord that  doth discern between the righteous and the wicked, in that day wherein I shall  affectionately meet those that love Me. Learn then and remember ye the law of  Moses, My servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the  statutes and judgments. Behold, I will send you Elijah the Tishbite before the coming  of the great and illustrious day of the Lord; and he shall turn the heart of the Father  to his son and the heart of man unto his neighbor, lest I come and smite the earth  swiftly, saith the Lord Almighty, the Holy God of Israel.  </p><h3>THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON  </h3><p>The righteous man if he happen to die early shall be at rest, and the dying  righteous man shall bring judgment unto the wicked living, for they will see the end  of the righteous one and will not understand what is destined for him. And the Lord  will hurl the wicked down voiceless and will remove them from their foundations,  and they shall pass away unto the last in sorrow and their memory shall vanish, for  they shall come in dread unto the realization of their sins, and their transgressions  shall convict them to their faces. Then the righteous man will stand up in great  boldness before those who offended him and despised his works. At the sight of him  they will be agitated with great fear and will feel astonished at his glorious salvation;  for, repenting and sighing from the oppression of the spirit, they shall speak within  themselves, saying: this is he whom we laughed at and held in scorn; we were so  foolish as to account his life as madness and his end dishonorable; how, then, is he  now numbered unto the sons of God and his lot is cast among the holy? We have  therefore wandered away from the right path, and the light of truth bath not  illumined us, and the sun hath not shone unto us; we were full of the wicked ways  and perdition, and walked in the unpassable paths, but did not comprehend God’s  ways.

<h3>Psalm 91</h3>
A psalm of a song for the Sabbath-day
IT IS a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord: and to sing praises unto thy
Name, O most Highest.
To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning: and of thy truth in the nightseason.
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the lute: upon a loud instrument,
and upon the harp.
For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy works: and I will rejoice in giving
praise for the operations of thy hands.
O Lord, how glorious are thy works: thy thoughts are very deep.
An unwise man doth not well consider this: and a fool doth not understand it.
When the ungodly are green as the grass, and when all the workers of
wickedness do flourish: then shall they be destroyed for ever; but thou,
Lord, art the most Highest for evermore.
For lo, thine enemies, O Lord, lo, thine enemies shall perish: and all the workers
of wickedness shall be destroyed.
But mine horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn: for I am anointed with
fresh oil.
Mine eye also shall see his lust of mine enemies: and mine ear shall hear his
desire of the wicked that arise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like a palm-tree: and shall spread abroad like a cedar
in Libanus.
Such as are planted in the house of the Lord: shall flourish in the courts of the
house of our God.
They also shall bring forth more fruit in their age: and shall be fat and wellliking.
That they may shew how true the Lord my strength is: and that there is no
unrighteousness in him.
<h3>Psalm 92</h3>
For the day before the Sabbath. When the land was first inhabited, the praise of a song by David
THE Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparel: the Lord hath put on his
apparel, and girded himself with strength.
He hath made the round world so sure: that it cannot be moved.
Ever since the world began hath thy seat been prepared: thou art from
everlasting.
The floods are risen, O Lord, the floods have lift up their voice: the floods lift up
their waves.
The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage horribly: but yet the Lord, who
dwelleth on high, is mightier.
Thy testimonies, O Lord, are very sure: holiness becometh thine house for ever.
<h3>Psalm 93</h3>
A psalm of David for the fourth day of the week
O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth: thou God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself.
Arise, thou Judge of the world: and reward the proud after their deserving.
Lord, how long shall the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly triumph?
How long shall all wicked doers speak so disdainfully: and make such proud
boasting?
They smite down thy people, O Lord: and trouble thine heritage.
They murder the widow and the stranger: and put the fatherless to death.
And yet they say, Tush, the Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob
regard it.
Take heed, ye unwise among the people: O ye fools, when will ye understand?
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear: or he that made the eye, shall he not
see?
Or he that nurtureth the heathen: it is he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not
he punish?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man: that they are but vain.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him in thy law.
That thou mayest give him patience in time of adversity: until the pit be digged
up for the ungodly.
For the Lord will not fail his people: neither will he forsake his inheritance;
Until righteousness turn again unto judgement: all such as are true in heart shall
follow it.
Who will rise up with me against the wicked: or who will take my part against
the evil-doers?
If the Lord had not helped me: it had not failed but my soul had been put to
silence.
But when I said, My foot hath slipt: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.
In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart: thy comforts have
refreshed my soul.
Wilt thou have any thing to do with the stool of wickedness: which imagineth
mischief as a law?
They gather them together against the soul of the righteous: and condemn the
innocent blood.
But the Lord is my refuge: and my God is the strength of my confidence.
He shall recompense them their wickedness, and destroy them in their own
malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them.

<h3>Psalm 94</h3>
The praise of a song, by David
O COME, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our
salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: and shew ourselves glad in
him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God: and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hills is his
also.
The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands prepared the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down: and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep
of his hand.
To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: as in the provocation,
and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
When your fathers tempted me: proved me, and saw my works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: It is a people that
do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways;
Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.
<h3>Psalm 95</h3>
When the house was built after the captivity. A song by David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the whole earth.
Sing unto the Lord, and praise his Name: be telling of his salvation from day to
day.
Declare his honour unto the heathen: and his wonders unto all people.
For the Lord is great, and cannot worthily be praised: he is more to be feared
than all gods.
As for all the gods of the heathen, they are but idols: but it is the Lord that made
the heavens.
Glory and worship are before him: power and honour are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people: ascribe unto the Lord
worship and power.
Ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his Name: bring presents, and come
into his courts.
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: let the whole earth stand in awe of
him.
Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord is King: and that it is he who hath
made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved; and how that he
shall judge the people righteously.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea make a noise, and
all that therein is.
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood
rejoice before the Lord.
For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: and with righteousness to judge
the world, and the people with his truth.
<h3>Psalm 96</h3>
For David, when his land is established
THE Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles
may be glad thereof.
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgement are the
habitation of his seat.
There shall go a fire before him: and burn up his enemies on every side.
His lightnings gave shine unto the world: the earth saw it, and was afraid.
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord
of the whole earth.
The heavens have declared his righteousness: and all the people have seen his
glory.
Confounded be all they that worship carved images, and that delight in vain
gods: worship him, all ye gods.
Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad, because of
thy judgements, O Lord.
For thou, Lord, art higher than all that are in the earth: thou art exalted far
above all gods.
O ye that love the Lord, see that ye hate the thing which is evil: the Lord
preserveth the souls of his saints; he shall deliver them from the hand of
the ungodly.
There is sprung up a light for the righteous: and the joyful gladness for such as
are true-hearted.
Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous: and give thanks for a remembrance of his
holiness.

<h3>Psalm 97</h3>
A Psalm of David
O SING unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous things.
With his own right hand, and with his holy arm: hath he gotten himself the
victory.
The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the
sight of the heathen.
He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel: and all the
ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.
Shew yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands: sing, rejoice, and give thanks.
Praise the Lord upon the harp: sing to the harp with a psalm of thanksgiving.
With trumpets also and shawms: O shew yourselves joyful before the Lord the
King.
Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is: the round world, and they that
dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together before the
Lord: for he is come to judge the earth.
With righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with equity.
<h3>Psalm 98</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord is King, be the people never so unpatient: he sitteth between the
cherubims, be the earth never so unquiet.
The Lord is great in Sion: and high above all people.
They shall give thanks unto thy Name: which is great, wonderful, and holy.
The King's power loveth judgement; thou hast prepared equity: thou hast
executed judgement and righteousness in Jacob.
O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before his footstool, for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among such as call upon his
Name: these called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
He spake unto them out of the cloudy pillar: for they kept his testimonies, and
the law that he gave them.
Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou forgavest them, O God, and
punishedst their own inventions.
O magnify the Lord our God, and worship him upon his holy hill: for the Lord our
God is holy.
<h3>Psalm 99</h3>
A psalm for thanksgiving
O BE joyful in the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come
before his presence with a song.
Be ye sure that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we
ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:
be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.
For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting: and his truth endureth from
generation to generation.
<h3>Psalm 100</h3>
A Psalm of David
MY SONG shall be of mercy and judgement: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.
O let me have understanding: in the way of godliness.
When wilt thou come unto me: I will walk in my house with a perfect heart.
I will take no wicked thing in hand; I hate the sins of unfaithfulness: there shall
no such cleave unto me.
A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour: him will I destroy.
Whoso hath also a proud look and high stomach: I will not suffer him.
Mine eyes look upon such as are faithful in the land: that they may dwell with
me.
Whoso leadeth a godly life: he shall be my servant.
There shall no deceitful person dwell in my house: he that telleth lies shall not
tarry in my sight.
I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the land: that I may root out all
wicked doers from the city of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 101</h3>
A prayer for the poor, when he is deeply afflicted and pours out his supplication before the Lord
HEAR my prayer, O Lord: and let my crying come unto thee.
Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine ear unto me
when I call; O hear me, and that right soon.
For my days are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt up as it
were a firebrand.
My heart is smitten down, and withered liked grass: so that I forget to eat my
bread.
For the voice of my groaning: my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh.
I am become like a pelican in the wilderness: and like an owl that is in the desert.
I have watched, and am even as it were a sparrow: that sitteth alone upon the
house-top.
Mine enemies revile me all the day long: and they that are mad upon me are
sworn together against me.
For I have eaten ashes as it were bread: and mingled my drink with weeping.
And that because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and
cast me down.
My days are gone like a shadow: and I am withered like grass.
But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever: and thy remembrance throughout all
generations.
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that thou have mercy
upon her, yea, the time is come.
And why? thy servants think upon her stones: and it pitieth them to see her in
the dust.
The heathen shall fear thy Name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy
majesty;
When the Lord shall build up Sion: and when his glory shall appear;
When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute: and despiseth not
their desire.
This shall be written for those that come after: and the people which shall be
born shall praise the Lord.
For he hath looked down from his sanctuary: out of the heaven did the Lord
behold the earth;
That he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity: and deliver the
children appointed unto death;
That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion: and his worship at
Jerusalem;
When the people are gathered together: and the kingdoms also, to serve the
Lord.
He brought down my strength in my journey: and shortened my days.
But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of mine age: as for thy
years, they endure throughout all generations.
Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: they all shall wax old as doth a
garment;
And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art
the same, and thy years shall not fail.
The children of thy servants shall continue: and their seed shall stand fast in thy
sight.
<h3>Psalm 102</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me praise his holy Name.
Praise the Lord, O my soul: and forget not all his benefits;
Who forgiveth all thy sin: and healeth all thine infirmities;
Who saveth thy life from destruction: and crowneth thee with mercy and lovingkindness;
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: making thee young and lusty as an
eagle.
The Lord executeth righteousness and judgement: for all them that are
oppressed with wrong.
He shewed his ways unto Moses: his works unto the children of Israel.
The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: long-suffering, and of great goodness.
He will not alway be chiding: neither keepeth he his anger for ever.
He hath not dealt with us after our sins: nor rewarded us according to our
wickednesses.
For look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth: so great is his mercy
also toward them that fear him.
Look how wide also the east is from the west: so far hath he set our sins from us.
Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children: even so is the Lord merciful unto
them that fear him.
For he knoweth whereof we are made: he remembereth that we are but dust.
The days of man are but as grass: for he flourisheth as a flower of the field.
For as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone: and the place thereof shall know
it no more.
But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth for ever and ever upon them that
fear him: and his righteousness upon children's children;
Even upon such as keep his covenant: and think upon his commandments to do
them.
The Lord hath prepared his seat in heaven: and his kingdom ruleth over all.
O praise the Lord, ye angels of his, ye that excel in strength: ye that fulfil his
commandment, and hearken unto the voice of his words.
O praise the Lord, all ye his hosts: ye servants of his that do his pleasure.
O speak good of the Lord, all ye works of his, in all places of his dominion: praise
thou the Lord, O my soul.

<h3>Psalm 103</h3>
A Psalm of David
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art become exceeding
glorious; thou art clothed with majesty and honour.
Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment: and spreadest out the
heavens like a curtain.
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: and maketh the clouds his
chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind.
He maketh his angels spirits: and his ministers a flaming fire.
He laid the foundations of the earth: that it never should move at any time.
Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment: the waters stand in the
hills.
At thy rebuke they flee: at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid.
They go up as high as the hills, and down to the valleys beneath: even unto the
place which thou hast appointed for them.
Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass: neither turn again to
cover the earth.
He sendeth the springs into the rivers: which run among the hills.
All beasts of the field drink thereof: and the wild asses quench their thirst.
Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their habitation: and sing among the
branches.
He watereth the hills from above: the earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
He bringeth forth grass for the cattle: and green herb for the service of men;
That he may bring food out of the earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of
man: and oil to make him a cheerful countenance, and bread to strengthen
man's heart.
The trees of the Lord also are full of sap: even the cedars of Libanus which he
hath planted;
Wherein the birds make their nests: and the fir-trees are a dwelling for the stork.
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats: and so are the stony rocks for the
conies.
He appointed the moon for certain seasons: and the sun knoweth his going down.
Thou makest darkness that it may be night: wherein all the beasts of the forest
do move.
The lions roaring after their prey: do seek their meat from God.
The sun ariseth, and they get them away together: and lay them down in their
dens.
Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour: until the evening.
O Lord, how manifold are thy works: in wisdom hast thou made them all; the
earth is full of thy riches.
So is the great and wide sea also: wherein are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great beasts.
There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan: whom thou hast made to take his
pastime therein.
These wait all upon thee: that thou mayest give them meat in due season.
When thou givest it them they gather it: and when thou openest thy hand they
are filled with good.
When thou hidest thy face they are troubled: when thou takest away their breath
they die, and are turned again to their dust.
When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made: and thou shalt renew
the face of the earth.
The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in
his works.
The earth shall tremble at the look of him: if he do but touch the hills, they shall
smoke.
I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will praise my God while I have my
being.
And so shall my words please him: my joy shall be in the Lord.
As for sinners, they shall be consumed out of the earth, and the ungodly shall
come to an end: praise thou the Lord, O my soul, praise the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 104</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his Name: tell the people what
things he hath done.
O let your songs be of him, and praise him: and let your talking be of all his
wondrous works.
Rejoice in his holy Name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek the Lord and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Remember the marvellous works that he hath done: his wonders, and the
judgements of his mouth.
O ye seed of Abraham his servant: ye children of Jacob his chosen.
He is the Lord our God: his judgements are in all the world.
He hath been alway mindful of his covenant and promise: that he made to a
thousand generations;
Even the covenant that he made with Abraham: and the oath that he sware unto
Isaac;
And appointed the same unto Jacob for a law: and to Israel for an everlasting
testament;
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan: the lot of your inheritance;
When there were yet but a few of them: and they strangers in the land;
What time as they went from one nation to another: from one kingdom to another
people;
He suffered no man to do them wrong: but reproved even kings for their sakes;
Touch not mine Anointed: and do my prophets no harm.
Moreover, he called for a dearth upon the land: and destroyed all the provision of
bread.
But he had sent a man before them: even Joseph, who was sold to be a bondservant;
Whose feet they hurt in the stocks: the iron entered into his soul;
Until the time came that his cause was known: the word of the Lord tried him.
The king sent, and delivered him: the prince of the people let him go free.
He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his substance;
That he might inform his princes after his will: and teach his senators wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt: and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people exceedingly: and made them stronger than their
enemies.
Whose heart turned, so that they hated his people: and dealt untruly with his
servants.
Then sent he Moses his servant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.
And these shewed his tokens among them: and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and it was dark: and they were not obedient unto his word.
He turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs: yea, even in their kings' chambers.
He spake the word, and there came all manner of flies: and lice in all their
quarters.
He gave them hail-stones for rain: and flames of fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and fig-trees: and destroyed the trees that were in
their coasts.
He spake the word, and the grasshoppers came, and caterpillars innumerable:
and did eat up all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of their
ground.
He smote all the first-born in their land: even the chief of all their strength.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: there was not one feeble person
among their tribes.
Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were afraid of them.
He spread out a cloud to be a covering: and fire to give light in the night-season.
At their desire he brought quails: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock of stone, and the waters flowed out: so that rivers ran in the
dry places.
For why? he remembered his holy promise: and Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy: and his chosen with gladness.
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people
in possession;
That they might keep his statutes: and observe his laws.

God Who had appeared in the flesh * takes away the sin of the world * and grants us 
the great mercy.

        <h3>     THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO SAINT MATHEW: (11, 2-15. )  </h3><p>At that time: John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his  disciples, And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, our do we look for  another? Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things  which ye do hear and see: The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers  are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel  preached to them. And blessed is (he)</h3><p>, whosoever shall not be offended in me. And  as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went  ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what went ye out  for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in  kings” houses. But what went ye out for to see? A Prophet? yea, I say unto you, and  more than a Prophet. For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my  messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. Verily I say unto  you, among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the  Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.  And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth  violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the Prophets and the law prophesied  until John. And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. He that hath  ears to hear, let him hear.  </p>

Thou didst appear unto all as the great Forerunner of the incarnate Word; wherefore I beseech thee to free me from the irrational influence of passions, and lead me to dispassion.

The winter of temptations holdeth me fast, and the storm of passions doth trouble me, but O Forerunner, reach hither with thy hand, and by thine intercessions lead the vessel of my soul into the safe haven of penitence.  Thou who hast baptized in the waters of the Jordan, Christ Who taketh away the sins of the world; do thou by the streams of thine intercessions make dry, O blessed John the Forerunner, the abyss of my evil deeds.

        <h3>THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES (13: 25-32)</h3><p>Brethren: as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not 
he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy 
to loose. Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among 
you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. For they that dwell at 
Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the 
Prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning 
him. And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he 
should be slain. And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took 
him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. But God raised him from the 
dead: And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to 
Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. And we declare unto you glad 
tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, 
</p><p><i class="note">Alleluia:</i> Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that 
call upon His name. 
</p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> The Lord preserveth the souls of His saints, from the hand of the 
sinner shall He deliver them. 
 
<h3>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATHEW (11:2-15)</h3><p>At that time: John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his 
disciples, And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for 
another? Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things 
which ye do hear and see: The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers 
are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel 
preached to them. And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. And as 
they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye 
out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what went ye out 
for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in 
kings” houses. But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and 
more than a prophet. For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my 
messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. Verily I say unto 
you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John 
the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than 
he. And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth 
violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the Prophets and the law prophesied 
until John. And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. He that hath 
ears to hear, let him hear.

<h3>Psalm 105</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for
ever.
Who can express the noble acts of the Lord: or shew forth all his praise?
Blessed are they that alway keep judgement: and do righteousness.
Remember me, O Lord, according to the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation;
That I may see the felicity of thy chosen: and rejoice in the gladness of thy
people, and give thanks with thine inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers: we have done amiss, and dealt wickedly.
Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great
goodness in remembrance: but were disobedient at the sea, even at the
Red sea.
Nevertheless, he helped them for his Name's sake: that he might make his power
to be known.
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the
deep, as through a wilderness.
And he saved them from the adversaries' hand: and delivered them from the
hand of the enemy.
As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them: there was not
one of them left.
Then believed they his words: and sang praise unto him.
But within a while they forgat his works: and would not abide his counsel.
But lust came upon them in the wilderness: and they tempted God in the desert.
And he gave them their desire: and sent leanness withal into their soul.
They angered Moses also in the tents: and Aaron the saint of the Lord.
So the earth opened, and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of
Abiram.
And the fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the ungodly.
They made a calf in Horeb: and worshipped the molten image.
Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.
And they forgat God their Saviour: who had done so great things in Egypt;
Wondrous works in the land of Ham: and fearful things by the Red sea.
So he said, he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood
before him in the gap: to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should
destroy them.
Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no credence unto his
word;
But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord.
Then lift he up his hand against them: to overthrow them in the wilderness;
To cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves unto Baal-peor: and ate the offerings of the dead.
Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions: and the plague was
great among them.
Then stood up Phinees and prayed: and so the plague ceased.
And that was counted unto him for righteousness: among all posterities for
evermore.
They angered him also at the waters of strife: so that he punished Moses for
their sakes;
Because they provoked his spirit: so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Neither destroyed they the heathen: as the Lord commanded them;
But were mingled among the heathen: and learned their works.
Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay: yea,
they offered their sons and their daughters unto devils;
And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters:
whom they had offered unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled
with blood.
Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring with their own
inventions.
Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people: insomuch that
he abhorred his own inheritance.
And he gave them over into the hands of the heathen: and they that hated them
were lords over them.
Their enemies oppressed them: and had them in subjection.
Many a time did he deliver them: but they rebelled against him with their own
inventions, and were brought down in their wickedness.
Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity: he heard their complaint.
He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them according unto the multitude of
his mercies: yea, he made all those that led them away captive to pity
them.
Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen: that we may
give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world without end: and
let all the people say, Amen.

<h3>Psalm 106</h3>
Alleluia
Let them give thanks whom the Lord hath redeemed: and delivered from the
hand of the enemy;
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west: from the
north and from the south.
They went astray in the wilderness out of the way: and found no city to dwell in;
Hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.
So they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: and he delivered them from their
distress.
He led them forth by the right way: that they might go to the city where they
dwelt.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he satisfieth the empty soul: and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: being fast bound in misery
and iron ;
Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord: and lightly regarded the
counsel of the most Highest;
He also brought down their heart through heaviness: they fell down, and there
was none to help them.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death: and brake
their bonds in sunder.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
For he hath broken the gates of brass: and smitten the bars of iron in sunder.
Foolish men are plagued for their offence: and because of their wickedness.
Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they were even hard at death's door.
So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivered them out of their
distress.
He sent his word, and healed them: and they were saved from their destruction.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving: and tell out his
works with gladness!
They that go down to the sea in ships: and occupy their business in great waters;
These men see the works of the Lord: and his wonders in the deep.
For at his word the stormy wind ariseth: which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to the deep: their soul
melteth away because of the trouble.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man: and are at their wits' end.
So when thy cry unto the Lord in their trouble: he delivereth them out of their
distress.
For he maketh the storm to cease: so that the waves thereof are still.
Then are they glad, because they are at rest: and so he bringeth them unto the
haven where they would be.
O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness: and declare the
wonders that he doeth for the children of men!
That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people: and praise him
in the seat of the elders!
Who turneth the floods into a wilderness: and drieth up the water-springs.
A fruitful land maketh he barren: for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water: and water-springs of a dry
ground.
And there he setteth the hungry: that they may build them a city to dwell in.
That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards: to yield them fruits of
increase.
He blesseth them so that they multiply exceedingly: and suffereth not their cattle
to decrease.
And again, when they are minished and brought low: through oppression,
through any plague or trouble;
Though he suffer them to be evil intreated through tyrants: and let them wander
out of the way in the wilderness.
Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery: and maketh him households like a flock of
sheep.
The righteous will consider this, and rejoice: and the mouth of all wickedness
shall be stopped.
Whoso is wise will ponder these things: and they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 107</h3>
Song of a psalm by David
O GOD, my heart is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing and give praise with the
best member that I have.
Awake, thou lute, and harp: I myself will awake right early.
I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing praises unto
thee among the nations.
For thy mercy is greater than the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the
clouds.
Set up thyself, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth.
That thy beloved may be delivered: let thy right hand save them, and hear thou
me.
God hath spoken in his holiness: I will rejoice therefore, and divide Sichem, and
mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is mine, and Manasses is mine: Ephraim also is the strength of my head.
Judah is my law-giver, Moab is my wash-pot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe,
upon Philistia will I triumph.
Who will lead me into the strong city: and who will bring me into Edom?
Hast not thou forsaken us, O God: and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our
hosts?
O help us against the enemy: for vain is the help of man.
Through God we shall do great acts: and it is he that shall tread down our
enemies.
<h3>Psalm 108</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
HOLD not thy tongue, O God of my praise: for the mouth of the ungodly, yea, the
mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.
And they have spoken against me with false tongues: they compassed me about
also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
For the love that I had unto them, lo, they take now my contrary part: but I give
myself unto prayer.
Thus have they rewarded me evil for good: and hatred for my good will.
Set thou an ungodly man to be ruler over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand.
When sentence is given upon him, let him be condemned: and let his prayer be
turned into sin.
Let his days be few: and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless: and his wife a widow.
Let his children be vagabonds, and beg their bread: let them seek it also out of
desolate places.
Let the extortioner consume all that he hath: and let the stranger spoil his
labour.
Let there be no man to pity him: nor to have compassion upon his fatherless
children.
Let his posterity be destroyed: and in the next generation let his name be clean
put out.
Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance in the sight of the Lord:
and let not the sin of his mother be done away.
Let them alway be before the Lord: that he may root out the memorial of them
from off the earth.
And that, because his mind was not to do good: but persecuted the poor helpless
man, that he might slay him that was vexed at the heart.
His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen unto him: he loved not blessing,
therefore shall it be far from him.
He clothed himself with cursing, like as with a raiment: and it shall come into his
bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be unto him as the cloke that he hath upon him: and as the girdle that he is
alway girded withal.
Let it thus happen from the Lord unto mine enemies: and to those that speak evil
against my soul.
But deal thou with me, O Lord God, according unto thy Name: for sweet is thy
mercy.
O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor: and my heart is wounded within me.
I go hence like the shadow that departeth: and am driven away as the
grasshopper.
My knees are weak through fasting: my flesh is dried up for want of fatness.
I became also a reproach unto them: they that looked upon me shaked their
heads.
Help me, O Lord my God: O save me according to thy mercy.
And they shall know, how that this is thy hand: and that thou, Lord, hast done it.
Though they curse, yet bless thou: and let them be confounded that rise up
against me; but let thy servant rejoice.
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame: and let them cover themselves with
their own confusion, as with a cloke.
As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth: and praise him
among the multitude.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor: to save his soul from the
unrighteous judges.

<h3>Psalm 134</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, laud ye the Name of the Lord: praise it, O ye servants of the
Lord;
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord: in the courts of the house of our God.
O praise the Lord, for the Lord is gracious: O sing praises unto his Name, for it is
lovely.
For why? the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself: and Israel for his own
possession.
For I know that the Lord is great: and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth: and in the sea,
and in all deep places.
He bringeth forth the clouds from the ends of the world: and sendeth forth
lightnings with the rain, bringing the winds out of his treasures.
He smote the first-born of Egypt: both of man and beast.
He hath sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O thou land of Egypt:
upon Pharaoh, and all his servants.
He smote divers nations: and slew mighty kings;
Sehon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Basan: and all the kingdoms of
Canaan;
And gave their land to be an heritage: even an heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever: so doth thy memorial, O Lord, from one
generation to another.
For the Lord will avenge his people: and be gracious unto his servants.
As for the images of the heathen, they are but silver and gold: the work of men's
hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, but they see not.
They have ears, and yet they hear not: neither is there any breath in their
mouths.
They that make them are like unto them: and so are all they that put their trust
in them.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Israel: praise the Lord, ye house of Aaron.
Praise the Lord, ye house of Levi: ye that fear the Lord, praise the Lord.
Praised be the Lord out of Sion: who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
<h3>Psalm 135</h3>
Alleluia
O give thanks unto the God of all gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O thank the Lord of all lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who only doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who by his excellent wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who laid out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who hath made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The sun to rule the day: for his mercy endureth for ever;
The moon and the stars to govern the night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote Egypt with their first-born: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever;
With a mighty hand, and stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who divided the Red sea in two parts: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And made Israel to go through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever.
But as for Pharaoh and his host, he overthrew them in the Red sea: for his mercy
endureth for ever.
Who led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Yea, and slew mighty kings: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Sehon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And Og the king of Basan: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And gave away their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever;
Even for an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who remembered us when we were in trouble: for his mercy endureth for ever;
And hath delivered us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 136</h3>
For David. A psalm of Jeremias
BY THE waters of Babylon we sat down and wept: when we remembered thee, O
Sion.
As for our harps, we hanged them up: upon the trees that are therein.
For they that led us away captive required of us then a song, and melody in our
heaviness: Sing us one of the songs of Sion.
How shall we sing the Lord's song: in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem: let my right hand forget her cunning.
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: yea, if I
prefer not Jerusalem in my mirth.
Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem: how they said,
Down with it, down with it, even to the ground.
O daughter of Babylon , wasted with misery: yea, happy shall he be that
rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us.
Blessed shall he be that taketh thy children: and throweth them against the
stones.

        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 137</h3>
A psalm of David, of Aggæus and Zacharias
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: even before the gods
will I sing praise unto thee.
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy Name, because of thy
loving-kindness and truth: for thou hast magnified thy Name and thy word
above all things.
When I called upon thee, thou heardest me: and enduedst my soul with much
strength.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they have heard the words
of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord: that great is the glory of the Lord.
For though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: as for the
proud, he beholdeth them afar off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shalt thou refresh me: thou shalt
stretch forth thy hand upon the furiousness of mine enemies, and thy right
hand shall save me.
The lord shall make good his loving-kindness toward me: yea, thy mercy, O Lord,
endureth for ever; despise not then the works of thine own hands.
<h3>Psalm 138</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
O LORD, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou knowest my downsitting and mine up-rising, thou understandest my thoughts long before.
Thou art about my path, and about my bed: and spiest out all my ways.
For lo, there is not a word in my tongue: but thou, O Lord, knowest it altogether.
Thou hast fashioned me behind and before: and laid thine hand upon me.
Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me: I cannot attain unto it.
Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit: or whither shall I go then from thy
presence?
If I climb up into heaven, thou art there: if I go down to hell, thou art there also.
If I take the wings of the morning: and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me.
If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall my night be turned
to day.
Yea, the darkness is no darkness with thee, but the night is as clear as the day:
the darkness and light to thee are both alike.
For my reins are thine: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
I will give thanks unto thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous
are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.
My bones are not hid from thee: though I be made secretly, and fashioned
beneath in the earth.
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect: and in thy book were all
my members written;
Which day by day were fashioned: when as yet there was none of them.
How dear are thy counsels unto me, O God: O how great is the sum of them!
If I tell them, they are more in number than the sand: when I wake up I am
present with thee.
Wilt thou not slay the wicked, O God: depart from me, ye blood-thirsty men.
For they speak unrighteously against thee: and thine enemies take thy Name in
vain.
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee: and am not I grieved with those that
rise up against thee?
Yea, I hate them right sore: even as though they were mine enemies.
Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart: prove me, and examine my
thoughts.
Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me: and lead me in the way
everlasting.
<h3>Psalm 139</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
DELIVER me, O Lord, from the evil man: and preserve me from the wicked man.
Who imagine mischief in their hearts: and stir up strife all the day long.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent: adders' poison is under their
lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly: preserve me from the wicked
men, who are purposed to overthrow my goings.
The proud have laid a snare for me, and spread a net abroad with cords: yea, and
set traps in my way.
I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my prayers, O Lord.
O Lord God, thou strength of my health: thou hast covered my head in the day of
the battle.
Let not the ungodly have his desire, O Lord: let not his mischievous imagination
prosper, lest they be too proud.
Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them: that compass me
about.
Let hot burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire and into the
pit, that they never rise up again.
A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: evil shall hunt the wicked
person to overthrow him.
Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor: and maintain the cause of the
helpless.
The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name: and the just shall continue in
thy sight.

<h3>Psalm 140</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, I call upon thee, haste thee unto me: and consider my voice when I cry
unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense: and let the lifting up of my
hands be an evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and keep the door of my lips.
O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing: let me not be occupied in
ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, lest I eat of such things
as please them.
Let the righteous rather smite me friendly: and reprove me.
But let not their precious balms break my head: yea, I will pray yet against their
wickedness.
Let their judges be overthrown in stony places: that they may hear my words, for
they are sweet.
Our bones lie scattered before the pit: like as when one breaketh and heweth
wood upon the earth.
But mine eyes look unto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust , O cast not out my
soul.
Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me: and from the traps of the
wicked doers.
Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together: and let me ever escape them.
<h3>Psalm 141</h3>
A psalm of instruction for David. When he was in the cave; a prayer
I CRIED unto the Lord with my voice: yea, even unto the Lord did I make my
supplication.
I poured out my complaints before him: and shewed him of my trouble.
When my spirit was in heaviness thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I
walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
I looked also upon my right hand: and saw there was no man that would know
me.
I had no place to flee unto: and no man cared for my soul.
I cried unto thee, O Lord, and said: Thou art my hope, and my portion in the land
of the living.
Consider my complaint: for I am brought very low.
O deliver me from my persecutors: for they are too strong for me.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name: which thing if
thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto my company.
<h3>Psalm 142</h3>
A psalm of David when his son pursued him
HEAR my prayer, O Lord, and consider my desire: hearken unto me for thy truth
and righteousness' sake.
And enter not into judgement with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
living be justified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the
ground: he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have been long
dead.
Therefore is my spirit vexed within me: and my heart within me is desolate.
Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works: yea, I exercise
myself in the works of thy hands.
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.
Hear me, O Lord, and that soon, for my spirit waxeth faint: hide not thy face from
me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning, for in thee is my trust:
shew thou me the way that I should walk in, for I lift up my soul unto thee.
Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I flee unto thee to hide me.
Teach me to do a thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God: let thy loving
Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.
Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name's sake: and for thy righteousness' sake bring
my soul out of trouble.
And of thy goodness slay mine enemies: and destroy all them that vex my soul ;
for I am thy servant.

<h3>Psalm 143</h3>
A psalm of David concerning Goliath
BLESSED be the Lord my strength: who teacheth my hands to war, and my
fingers to fight.
My hope and my fortress, my castle and deliverer, my defender in whom I trust:
who subdueth my people that is under me.
Lord, what is man, that thou hast such respect unto him: or the son of man, that
thou so regardest him?
Man is like a thing of nought: his time passeth away like a shadow.
Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall
smoke.
Cast forth thy lightning, and tear them: shoot out thine arrows, and consume
them.
Send down thine hand from above: deliver me, and take me out of the great
waters, from the hand of strange children.
Whose mouth talketh of vanity: and their right hand is a right hand of
wickedness.
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: and sing praises unto thee upon a tenstringed lute.
Thou hast given victory unto kings: and hast delivered David thy servant from
the peril of the sword.
Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children: whose mouth talketh
of vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.
That our sons may grow up as the young plants: and that our daughters may be
as the polished corners of the temple.
That our garners may be full and plenteous with all manner of store: that our
sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets.
That our oxen may be strong to labour, that there be no decay: no leading into
captivity, and no complaining in our streets.
Happy are the people that are in such a case: yea, blessed are the people who
have the Lord for their God.
<h3>Psalm 144</h3>
David's Psalm of praise
I WILL magnify thee, O God, my King: and I will praise thy Name for ever and
ever.
Every day will I give thanks unto thee: and praise thy Name for ever and ever.
Great is the Lord, and marvellous worthy to be praised: there is no end of his
greatness.
One generation shall praise thy works unto another: and declare thy power.
As for me, I will be talking of thy worship: thy glory, thy praise, and wondrous
works;
So that men shall speak of the might of thy marvellous acts: and I will also tell of
thy greatness.
The memorial of thine abundant kindness shall be shewed: and men shall sing of
thy righteousness.
The Lord is gracious and merciful: long-suffering and of great goodness.
The Lord is loving unto every man: and his mercy is over all his works.
All thy works praise thee, O Lord: and thy saints give thanks unto thee.
They shew the glory of thy kingdom: and talk of thy power;
That thy power, thy glory, and mightiness of thy kingdom: might be known unto
men.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom: and thy dominion endureth throughout
all ages.
The Lord upholdeth all such as fall: and lifteth up all those that are down.
The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord: and thou givest them their meat in due
season.
Thou openest thine hand: and fillest all things living with plenteousness.
The Lord is righteous in all his ways: and holy in all his works.
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: yea, all such as call upon him
faithfully.
He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will
help them.
The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but scattereth abroad all the
ungodly.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh give thanks unto his
holy Name for ever and ever.

<h3>Psalm 145</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
PRAISE the Lord, O my soul; while I live will I praise the Lord: yea, as long as I
have any being, I will sing praises unto my God.
O put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man: for there is no help in
them.
For when the breath of man goeth forth he shall turn again to his earth: and then
all his thoughts perish.
Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help: and whose hope is in the
Lord his God;
Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: who keepeth his
promise for ever;
Who helpeth them to right that suffer wrong: who feedeth the hungry.
The Lord looseth men out of prison: the Lord giveth sight to the blind.
The Lord helpeth them that are fallen: the Lord careth for the righteous.
The Lord careth for the strangers, he defendeth the fatherless and widow :as for
the way of the ungodly, he turneth it upside down.
The Lord thy God, O Sion, shall be King for evermore: and throughout all
generations.
<h3>Psalm 146</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises unto our God: yea, a
joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: and gather together the out-casts of Israel.
He healeth those that are broken in heart: and giveth medicine to heal their
sickness.
He telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and great is his power: yea, and his wisdom is infinite.
The Lord setteth up the meek: and bringeth the ungodly down to the ground.
O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving: sing praises upon the harp unto our God;
Who covereth the heavens with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth: and
maketh the grass to grow upon the mountains, and herb for the use of men;
Who giveth fodder unto the cattle: and feedeth the young ravens that call upon
him.
He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse: neither delighteth he in any
man's legs.
But the Lord's delight is in them that fear him: and put their trust in his mercy.
<h3>Psalm 147</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.
For he hath made fast the bars of thy gates: and hath blessed thy children within
thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the flour of wheat.
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: and his word runneth very
swiftly.
He giveth snow like wool: and scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who is able to abide his frost?
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he bloweth with his wind, and the
waters flow.
He sheweth his word unto Jacob: his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with any nation: neither have the heathen knowledge of his
laws.

<h3>Psalm 148</h3>
Alleluia. A psalm of Aggæus and Zacharias
O PRAISE the Lord of heaven: praise him in the height.
Praise him, all ye angels of his: praise him, all his host.
Praise him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars and light.
Praise him, all ye heavens: and ye waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the Name of the Lord: for he spake the word, and they were
made; he commanded, and they were created.
He hath made them fast for ever and ever: he hath given them a law which shall
not be broken.
Praise the Lord upon earth: ye dragons, and all deeps;
Fire and hail, snow and vapours: wind and storm, fulfilling his word;
Mountains and all hills: fruitful trees and all cedars;
Beasts and all cattle: worms and feathered fowls;
Kings of the earth and all people: princes and all judges of the world;
Young men and maidens, old men and children, praise the Name of the Lord: for
his Name only is excellent, and his praise above heaven and earth.
He shalt exalt the horn of his people; all his saints shall praise him: even the
children of Israel, even the people the serveth him.
<h3>Psalm 149</h3>
Alleluia
O SING unto the Lord a new song: let the congregation of saints praise him.
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: and let the children of Sion be joyful in
their King.
Let them praise his Name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with
tabret and harp.
For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: and helpeth the meek-hearted.
Let the saints be joyful with glory: let them rejoice in their beds.
Let the praises of God be in their mouth: and a two-edged sword in their hands;
To be avenged of the heathen: and to rebuke the people;
To bind their kings in chains: and their nobles with links of iron.
That they may be avenged of them, as it is written: Such honour have all his
saints.
<h3>Psalm 150</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE God in his holiness: praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him in his noble acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.
Praise him in the sound of the trumpet: praise him upon the lute and harp.
Praise him in the cymbals and dances: praise him upon the strings and pipe.
Praise him upon the well-tuned cymbals: praise him upon the loud cymbals.
Let every thing that hath breath: praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 151</h3>
This psalm is ascribed to David and is outside the number. When he slew Goliath in single
combat.
LITTLE was I among my brethren: a younger brother in my father’s house.
My hands, they made an instrument of music: my fingers, they prepared a
psaltery.
And who shall bring back tidings to my master? The Lord himself, himself gives
ear.
Himself sent forth his messenger: and took me from among my father’s sheep;
and with the oil of his anointing He anointed me.
Comely my brethren were and tall: and yet they found not favor with the Lord.
But I, I sallied forth to meet the alien: and he reviled me by all his idols.
But I drew forth the sword that was beside him: I cut his head off with it, and
from the sons of Israel removed reproach.</div>

Thou alone hast been shown to be the one whose conception was most pure and whose birthgiving was incorrupt, such that thou didst remain a virgin; for thou didst conceive Christ, the God of all, Who became a man, O pure one, for the salvation and deliverance of the faithful. </p><h3>Ode VIII</h3><p></p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Cross </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> Disdaining the golden image, the thrice-blessed children, * beholding the immutable and living image of God, * chanted in the midst of the flame: * Let all existing creation hymn the Lord * and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!  Disobedient men, who lacking compunction wrought all manner of iniquities, raised up upon the Tree between two malefactors Thee, Who dost justify sinners, crucifying Thee, O Compassionate One; but all creation glorifieth Thee as Lord and Master, hymning Thy long-suffering. Nailed to the Tree, Thou didst bloody Thy fingers, O Christ, and Thou didst bring an end to the blood sacrificed of old to the demons unto the damnation of those who offered it up. Wherefore, all creation glorifieth Thee, hymning Thy love for mankind, O God of all. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> The immeasurable quantity of your blood quenched the fire of ungodliness and did away with the delusion of pagan polytheism, O saints; illumining all the faithful, who chant: Let all creation hymn the Lord and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages! </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The unblemished Ewe-lamb, the adornment of the prophets and martyrs, beholding Thee lifted up upon the Tree like a lamb, O Word Who art without beginning, wept bitterly and said: “Let all existing creation hymn the Lord and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> God Who descended into the fiery furnace * with the Hebrew children, * and transformed the flame into dew, * do ye works hymn, * and supremely exalt as Lord throughout all ages.

Forget not the cry of those who pray to thee, O awesome intercessor, but by thine intercessions rescue them from all pain and every threat; for thy maternal supplications incline God to mercy. Still now the tempest of my passions, O pure and blessed Maiden, and vanquish all the incorporeal foes who pitilessly assail my poverty, that I may hymn thee with faith. At the hour of mine end, O only Birthgiver of God, intercessor for the faithful, rescue me from the furnace of temptations, the flame of sins and the fire of the passions, from Gehenna and the assaults of the demons.

Of old, Isaac was bound, that he might provide an image of Thy suffering; and as a symbol of remission Abraham freed the lamb who was caught in the thicket, releasing a truly involuntary sacrifice. But Thou wast willingly sacrificed, Thou didst thereby free us from evils. Glory to Thy loving-kindness, O only loving Lord Christ, Who art comely in beauty more than the sons of men, yet wast bereft of form and beauty when Thou wast hung upon the tree of the Cross, transforming the ugliness of the whole race of mankind into beauty! </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Ye were shown to be divine inhabitants of the heavenly Sion and fellow citizens equal in honor with the angels, O martyrs; and ye illumine with splendor the Church of the firstborn, O saints, shining with divine light, and wearing your torments as crowns. </p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> O holy martyrs and beloved friends of the Lord Who most gloriously loved you: Deliver me from the friendship of the deceiver, which is of the flesh; and ask that sanctification, enlightenment and the remission of transgressions be given to all who keep your memory. </p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> The beauty of the heavenly spheres left their usual course when they beheld Thee, the Sun of righteousness, willingly lifted up upon the Cross; and with the virginal disciple the Virgin exclaimed, weeping and crying aloud: “Woe is me! What is this strange sight?” </p><p><i class="note">Canon of the Theotokos </i></p><p><i class="note">Irmos:</i> The Son of the Beginningless Father, God and Lord, * hath appeared to us incarnate of a Virgin, * to enlighten those in darkness, * and to gather the dispersed; * therefore the all-hymned Theotokos do we magnify In a manner transcending understanding and all telling thou hast given birth to the only greatly merciful Lord and Lover of mankind. Him do thou beseech, O Virgin, that at the dread hour of judgment He deliver thy servant from everlasting fire. O Bride of God, from heaven grant remission of evil unto us who hymn thee, who glorify thee with faith, and ever hasten to thy divine protection; and deliver us from the despotic passions, from torments and judgment. The fruit of sin which brought death upon me was beautiful to behold, yet most bitter to taste; yet because I ate of it to satiety, I await the dread judgment. But rescue me therefore, O most holy Virgin Mother. In that thou didst bear the Good One and art wholly good, O most pure one, bless my lowly heart, which hath been restrained by the bars of pleasures; and lead me through the beautiful doors of repentance.

<h3>Psalm 119</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN I was in trouble I called upon the Lord: and he heard me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitful tongue.
What reward shall be given or done unto thee, thou false tongue: even mighty
and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.
Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell with Mesech: and to have my
habitation among the tents of Kedar.
My soul hath long dwelt among them: that are enemies unto peace.
I labour for peace, but when I speak unto them thereof: they make them ready to
battle.
<h3>Psalm 120</h3>
A song of ascents
I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh even from the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and he that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel: shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy defence upon thy right hand.
So that the sun shall not burn thee by day: neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, it is even he that shall keep thy
soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in: from this time forth for
evermore.
<h3>Psalm 121</h3>
A song of ascents
I WAS glad when they said unto me: We will go into the house of the Lord.
Our feet shall stand in thy gates: O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city: that is at unity in itself.
For thither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord: to testify unto Israel, to
give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.
For there is the seat of judgement: even the seat of the house of David.
O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
Peace be within thy walls: and plenteousness within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions' sakes: I will wish thee prosperity.
Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God: I will seek to do thee good.
<h3>Psalm 122</h3>
A song of ascents
UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, even as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as
the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: even so our eyes wait
upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are utterly despised.
Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy: and with the
despitefulness of the proud.
<h3>Psalm 123</h3>
A song of ascents
IF THE Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say: if the Lord
himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us;
They had swallowed us up quick: when thy were so wrathfully displeased at us.
Yea, the waters had drowned us: and the stream had gone over our soul.
The deep waters of the proud: had gone even over our soul.
But praised be the Lord: who hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth.
Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler: the snare is
broken, and we are delivered .
Our help standeth in the Name of the Lord: who hath made heaven and earth.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 124</h3>
A song of ascents
THEY that put their trust in the Lord shall be even as the mount Sion: which may
not be removed, but standeth fast for ever.
The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so standeth the Lord round about his
people, from this time forth for evermore.
For the rod of the ungodly cometh not into the lot of the righteous: lest the
righteous put their hand unto wickedness.
Do well, O Lord: unto those that are good and true of heart.
As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness: the Lord shall lead them
forth with the evil-doers; but peace shall be upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 125</h3>
A song of ascents
WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion: then were we like unto them
that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter: and our tongue with joy.
Then said they among the heathen: The Lord hath done great things for them.
Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already: whereof we rejoice.
Turn our captivity, O Lord: as the rivers in the south.
They that sow in tears: shall reap in joy.
He that now goeth on his way weeping, and beareth forth good seed: shall
doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.
<h3>Psalm 126</h3>
A song of ascents
EXCEPT the Lord build the house: their labour is but lost that build it.
Except the Lord keep the city: the watchman waketh but in vain.
It is but lost labour that ye haste to rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat
the bread of carefulness: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
Lo, children and the fruit of the womb: are an heritage and gift that cometh of
the Lord.
Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant: even so are the young children.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed
when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
<h3>Psalm 127</h3>
A song of ascents
BLESSED are all they that fear the Lord: and walk in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labours of thine hands: O well is thee, and happy shalt
thou be.
Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of thine house.
Thy children like the olive-branches: round about thy table.
Lo, thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the Lord.
The Lord from out of Sion shall so bless thee: that thou shalt see Jerusalem in
prosperity all thy life long.
Yea, that thou shalt see thy children's children: and peace upon Israel.
<h3>Psalm 128</h3>
A song of ascents
MANY a time have they fought against me from my youth up: may Israel now
say.
Yea, many a time have they vexed me from my youth up: but they have not
prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed upon my back: and made long furrows.
But the righteous Lord: hath hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.
Let them be confounded and turned backward: as many as have evil will at Sion.
Let them be even as the grass growing upon the house-tops: which withereth
afore it be plucked up;
Whereof the mower filleth not his hand: neither he that bindeth up the sheaves
his bosom.
So that they who go by say not so much as, The Lord prosper you: we wish you
good luck in the Name of the Lord.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 129</h3>
A song of ascents
OUT of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.
O let thine ears consider well: the voice of my complaint.
If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done amiss: O Lord, who may
abide it?
For there is mercy with thee: therefore shalt thou be feared.
I look for the Lord; my soul doth wait for him: in his word is my trust.
My soul fleeth unto the Lord: before the morning watch, I say, before the
morning watch.
O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with him is
plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel: from all his sins.
<h3>Psalm 130</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, I am not high-minded: I have no proud looks.
I do not exercise myself in great matters: which are too high for me.
But I refrain my soul, and keep it low, like as a child that is weaned from his
mother: yea, my soul is even as a weaned child.
O Israel, trust in the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 131</h3>
A song of ascents
LORD, remember David: and all his trouble;
How he sware unto the Lord: and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God of Jacob;
I will not come within the tabernacle of mine house: nor climb up into my bed;
I will not suffer mine eyes to sleep, nor mine eye-lids to slumber: neither the
temples of my head to take any rest;
Until I find out a place for the temple of the Lord: an habitation for the mighty
God of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of the same at Ephrata: and found it in the wood.
We will go into his tabernacle: and fall low on our knees before his footstool.
Arise, O Lord, into thy resting-place: thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness: and let thy saints sing with
joyfulness.
For thy servant David's sake: turn not away the presence of thine Anointed.
The Lord hath made a faithful oath unto David: and he shall not shrink from it;
Of the fruit of thy body: shall I set upon thy seat.
If thy children will keep my covenant, and my testimonies that I shall learn them:
their children also shall sit upon thy seat for evermore.
For the Lord hath chosen Sion to be an habitation for himself: he hath longed for
her.
This shall be my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.
I will bless her victuals with increase: and will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will deck her priests with health: and her saints shall rejoice and sing.
There shall I make the horn of David to flourish: I have ordained a lantern for
mine Anointed.
As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame: but upon himself shall his
crown flourish.
<h3>Psalm 132</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD, how good and joyful a thing it is: brethren, to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down unto the beard:
even unto Aaron's beard, and went down to the skirts of his clothing.
Like as the dew of Hermon: which fell upon the hill of Sion.
For there the Lord promised his blessing: and life for evermore.
<h3>Psalm 133</h3>
A song of ascents
BEHOLD now, praise the Lord: all ye servants of the Lord;
Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord: even in the courts of the house of
our God.
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary: and praise the Lord.
The Lord that made heaven and earth: give thee blessing out of Sion.

<h3>Psalm 109</h3>
A Psalm of David
THE Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool.
The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Sion: be thou ruler, even in the
midst among thine enemies.
In the day of thy power shall the people offer thee free-will offerings with an holy
worship: the dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning.
The Lord sware, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech..
The Lord upon thy right hand: shall wound even kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the heathen; he shall fill the places with the dead bodies:
and smite in sunder the heads over divers countries.
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up his head.
<h3>Psalm 110</h3>
Alleluia
I WILL give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart: secretly among the
faithful, and in the congregation.
The works of the Lord are great: sought out of all of them that have pleasure
therein.
His work is worthy to be praised and had in honour: and his righteousness
endureth for ever.
The merciful and gracious Lord hath so done his marvellous works: that they
ought to be had in remembrance.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he shall ever be mindful of his
covenant.
He hath shewed his people the power of his works: that he may give them the
heritage of the heathen.
The works of his hands are verity and judgement: all his commandments are
true.
They stand fast for ever and ever: and are done in truth and equity.
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever;
holy and reverend is his Name.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all
they that do thereafter; the praise of it endureth for ever.
<h3>Psalm 111</h3>
Alleluia
BLESSED is the man that feareth the Lord: he hath great delight in his
commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the faithful shall be
blessed.
Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth
for ever.
Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness: he is merciful, loving, and
righteous.
A good man is merciful, and lendeth: and will guide his words with discretion.
For he shall never be moved: and the righteous shall be had in everlasting
remembrance.
He will not be afraid of any evil tidings: for his heart standeth fast, and believeth
in the Lord.
His heart is established, and will not shrink: until he see his desire upon his
enemies.
He hath dispersed abroad, and given to the poor: and his righteousness
remaineth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
The ungodly shall see it, and it shall grieve him: he shall gnash with his teeth,
and consume away; the desire of the ungodly shall perish.

<h3>Psalm 112</h3>
Alleluia
PRAISE the Lord, ye servants: O praise the Name of the Lord.
Blessed be the Name of the Lord: from this time forth for evermore.
The Lord's Name is praised: from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of
the same.
The Lord is high above all heathen and his glory above the heavens.
Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling so high: and yet
humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?
He taketh up the simple out of the dust: and lifteth the poor out of the mire;
That he may set him with the princes: even with the princes of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to keep house: and to be a joyful mother of
children.
<h3>Psalm 113</h3>
Alleluia
WHEN Israel came out of Egypt: and the house of Jacob from among the strange
people.
Judah was his sanctuary: and Israel his dominion.
The sea saw that, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
The mountains skipped like rams: and the little hills like young sheep.
What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest: and thou Jordan, that thou wast
driven back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams: and ye little hills, like young sheep?
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the God of
Jacob.
Who turned the hard rock into a standing water: and the flint-stone into a
springing well.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the praise: for thy
loving mercy and for thy truth's sake.
Wherefore shall the heathen say: Where is now their God?
As for our God, he is in heaven: he hath done whatsoever pleased him.
Their idols are silver and gold: even the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, and speak not: eyes have they, and see not.
They have ears, and hear not: noses have they and smell not.
They have hands, and handle not; feet have they, and walk not: neither speak
they through their throat.
They that make them are like unto them ; and so are all such as put their trust in
them.
But thou, house of Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their succour and defence.
Ye house of Aaron, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
Ye that fear the Lord, put your trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
The Lord hath been mindful of us, and he shall bless us: even he shall bless the
house of Israel, he shall bless the house of Aaron.
He shall bless them that fear the Lord: both small and great.
The Lord shall increase you more and more: you and your children.
Ye are the blessed of the Lord: who made heaven and earth.
All the whole heavens are the Lord's: the earth hath he given to the children of
men.
The dead praise not thee, O Lord: neither all they that go down into silence.
But we will praise the Lord: from this time forth for evermore. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 114</h3>
Alleluia
I AM well pleased: that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer.
That he hath inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call upon him as long as I
live.
The snares of death compassed me round about: and the pains of hell gat hold
upon me.
I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I will call upon the Name of the Lord: O
Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea, our God is merciful
The Lord preserveth the simple: I was in misery, and he helped me.
Turn again then unto thy rest, O my soul: for the Lord hath rewarded thee.
And why? thou hast delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from tears, and my
feet from falling.
I will walk before the Lord: in the land of the living.

<h3>Psalm 115</h3>
Alleluia
I BELIEVED, and therefore will I speak; but I was sore troubled: I said in my
haste, All men are liars.
What reward shall I give unto the Lord: for all the benefits that he hath done
unto me?
I will receive the cup of salvation: and call upon the Name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows now in the presence of all his people: right dear in the sight of
the Lord is the death of his saints.
Behold, O Lord, how that I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thine
handmaid; thou hast broken my bonds in sunder.
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the Name of
the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of all his people: in the courts of
the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 116</h3>
Alleluia
O PRAISE the Lord, all ye heathen: praise him, all ye nations.
For his merciful kindness is ever more and more towards us: and the truth of the
Lord endureth for ever. Praise the Lord.
<h3>Psalm 117</h3>
Alleluia
O GIVE thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: because his mercy endureth for
ever.
Let Israel now confess that he is gracious: and that his mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
Yea, let them now that fear the Lord confess: that his mercy endureth for ever.
I called upon the Lord in trouble: and the Lord heard me at large.
The Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man doeth unto me.
The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire
upon mine enemies.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in man.
It is better to trust in the Lord: than to put any confidence in princes.
All nations compassed me round about: but in the Name of the Lord will I destroy
them.
They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side: but in the
Name of the Lord will I destroy them.
They came about me like bees, and are extinct even as the fire among the thorns:
for in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them.
Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but the Lord was my help.
The Lord is my strength, and my song: and is become my salvation.
The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous: the right hand of
the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass.
The right hand of the Lord hath the pre-eminence: the right hand of the Lord
bringeth mighty things to pass.
I shall not die, but live: and declare the works of the Lord.
The Lord hath chastened and corrected me: but he hath not given me over unto
death.
Open me the gates of righteousness: that I may go into them, and give thanks
unto the Lord.
This is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into it.
I will thank thee, for thou hast heard me: and art become my salvation.
The same stone which the builders refused: is become the head-stone in the
corner.
This is the Lord's doing: and it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath made: we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Help me now, O Lord: O Lord, send us now prosperity.
Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: we have wished you good
luck , ye that are of the house of the Lord.
God is the Lord who hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, yea,
even unto the horns of the altar.
Thou art my God, and I will thank thee: thou art my God, and I will praise thee.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: and his mercy endureth for ever.

I am thy servant, O grant me understanding: that I may know thy testimonies.
It is time for thee, Lord to lay to thine hand: for they have destroyed thy law.
For I love thy commandments: above gold and precious stone.
Therefore hold I straight all thy commandments: and all false ways I utterly
abhor.
Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.
When thy word goeth forth: it giveth light and understanding unto the simple.
I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath: for my delight was in thy
commandments.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
O look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me: as thou usest to do unto those
that love thy Name.
Order my steps in thy word: and so shall no wickedness have dominion over me.
O deliver me from the wrongful dealings of men: and so shall I keep thy
commandments.
Shew the light of thy countenance upon thy servant: and teach me thy statutes.
Mine eyes gush out with water: because men keep not thy law.
Righteous art thou, O Lord: and true is thy judgement.
The testimonies that thou hast commanded: are exceeding righteous and true.
My zeal hath even consumed me: because mine enemies have forgotten thy
words.
Thy word is tried to the uttermost: and thy servant loveth it.
I am small, and of no reputation: yet do I not forget thy commandments.
Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness: and thy law is the truth.
Trouble and heaviness have taken hold upon me: yet is my delight in thy
commandments.
The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: O grant me understanding,
and I shall live.
I with my whole heart: hear me, O Lord, I will keep thy statutes.
Yea, even unto thee do I call: help me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
Early in the morning do I cry unto thee: for in thy word is my trust.
Mine eyes prevent the night-watches: that I might be occupied in thy words.
Hear my voice, O Lord, according unto my loving-kindness: quicken me,
according as thou art wont.
Hear my voice, O Lord, according unto thy loving-kindness: quicken me,
according as thou art wont.
They draw nigh that of malice persecute me: and are far from thy law.
Be thou nigh at hand, O Lord: for all thy commandments are true.
As concerning thy testimonies, I have known long since: that thou hast grounded
them for ever.
O consider mine adversity, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.
Avenge thou my cause, and deliver me: quicken me, according to thy word.
Health is far from the ungodly: for they regard not thy statutes.
Great is thy mercy, O Lord: quicken me, as thou art wont.
Many there are that trouble me, and persecute me: yet do I not swerve from thy
testimonies.
It grieveth me when I see the transgressors: because they keep not thy law.
Consider, O Lord, how I love thy commandments: O quicken me, according to thy
loving-kindness.
Thy word is true from everlasting: all the judgements of thy righteousness
endure for evermore.
Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy
word.
I am as glad of thy word: as one that findeth great spoils.
As for lies, I hate and abhor them: but thy law do I love.
Seven times a day do I praise thee: because of thy righteous judgements.
Great is the peace that they have who love thy law: and they are not offended at
it.
Lord, I have looked for thy saving health: and done after thy commandments.
My soul hath kept thy testimonies: and loved them exceedingly.
I have kept thy commandments and testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.
Let my complaint come before thee, O Lord: give me understanding, according to
thy word.
Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me, according to thy word.
My lips shall speak of thy praise: when thou hast taught me thy statutes.
Yea, my tongue shall sing of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteous.
Let thine hand help me: for I have chosen thy commandments.
I have longed for thy saving health, O Lord: and in thy law is my delight.
O let my soul live, and it shall praise thee: and thy judgements shall help me.
I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost: O seek thy servant, for I do not forget
thy commandments.

<h4>First Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 1</h3>
BLESSED is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
stood in the way of sinners: and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful.
But his delight is in the law of the Lord: and in his law will he exercise himself
day and night.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side: that will bring forth his
fruit in due season.
His leaf also shall not wither: and look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper.
As for the ungodly, it is not so with them: but they are like the chaff, which the
wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.
Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment: neither the
sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
But the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: and the way of the ungodly shall
perish.
<h3>Psalm 2</h3>
WHY do the heathen so furiously rage together: and why do the people imagine a
vain thing?
The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together: against the
Lord, and against his Anointed.
Let us break their bonds asunder: and cast away their cords from us.
He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: the Lord shall have them
in derision.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath: and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Yet I have set my King: upon my holy hill of Sion.
I will preach the law, whereof the Lord hath said unto me: Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee.
Desire of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance: and the
utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron: and break them in pieces like a
potter's vessel.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be learned, ye that are judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord in fear: and rejoice unto him with reverence.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way: if his wrath
be kindled, (yea, but a little,) blessed are all they that put their trust in
him.
<h3>Psalm 3</h3>
A psalm of David. When he fled from the presence of his son Absalom
LORD, how are they increased that trouble me: many are they that rise against
me.
Many one there be that say of my soul: There is no help for him in his God.
But thou, O Lord, art my defender: thou art my worship, and the lifter up of my
head.
I did call upon the Lord with my voice: and he heard me out of his holy hill.
I laid me down and slept, and rose up again: for the Lord sustained me.
I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people: that have set themselves
against me round about.
Up, Lord, and help me, O my God: for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the
cheekbone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.
    </div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 4</h3>
For the end. A song of David among the Psalms
HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast set me at liberty
when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour: and have such
pleasure in vanity, and seek after leasing?
Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that is godly: when
I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart, and in your chamber,
and be still.
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness: and put your trust in the Lord.
There be many that say: Who will shew us any good?
Lord, lift thou up: the light of thy countenance upon us.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart: since the time that their corn and wine and
oil increased.
I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest: for it is thou, Lord, only, that
makest me dwell in safety.
<h3>Psalm 5</h3>
For the end. A song of David concerning her that inherits
PONDER my words, O Lord: consider my meditation
O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King, and my God: for unto thee
will I make my prayer.
My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O Lord: early in the morning will I direct my
prayer unto thee, and will look up.
For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness: neither shall any devil
dwell with thee.
Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest all of them that
work vanity.
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor both the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude of thy
mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies: make thy way
plain before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in his mouth: their inward parts are very wickedness.
Their throat is an open sepulchre: they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own imaginations: cast
them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebelled
against thee.
And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: they shall ever be giving of
thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be
joyful in thee;
For thou, Lord, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous: and with thy favourable
kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
<h3>Psalm 6</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David among the hymns for the eighth
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy
displeasure.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord, heal me, for my bones are
vexed.
My soul also is sore troubled: but, Lord, how long wilt thou punish me?
Turn thee, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's sake.
For in death no man remembereth thee: and who will give thee thanks in the pit?
I am weary of my groaning; every night wash I my bed: and water my couch with
my tears.
My beauty is gone for very trouble: and worn away because of all mine enemies.
Away from me, all ye that work vanity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my
weeping.
The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer.
All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed: they shall be turned back,
and put to shame suddenly.
    </div>
      
        <div>
<h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 7</h3>
A psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the Benjamite
O LORD my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all them that
persecute me, and deliver me;
Lest he devour my soul, like a lion, and tear it in pieces: while there is none to
help.
O Lord my God, if I have done any such thing: or if there be any wickedness in
my hands;
If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me: yea, I have delivered
him that without any cause is mine enemy,
Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me: yea, let him tread my life
down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.
Stand up, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself, because of the indignation of
mine enemies: arise up for me in the judgement that thou hast
commanded.
And so shall the congregation of the people come about thee: for their sakes
therefore lift up thyself again.
The Lord shall judge the people; give sentence with me, O Lord: according to my
righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in me.
O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end: but guide thou the just.
For the righteous God: trieth the very hearts and reins.
My help cometh of God: who preserveth them that are true of heart.
God is a righteous Judge, strong and patient: and God is provoked every day.
If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword: he hath bent his bow, and made it
ready.
He hath prepared for him the instruments of death: he ordaineth his arrows
against the persecutors
Behold, he travaileth with mischief: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth
ungodliness.
He hath graven and digged up a pit: and is fallen on himself into the destruction
that he made for other.
For his travail shall come upon his own head: and his wickedness shall fall on his
own pate.
I will give thanks unto the Lord, according to his righteousness: and I will praise
the Name of the Lord most High.
<h3>Psalm 8</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the winepresses
O LORD our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world: thou hast set
thy glory above the heavens!
Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength,
because of thine enemies: that thou mightest still the enemy and the
avenger.
For I will consider thy heavens, even the works of thy fingers: the moon and the
stars, which thou hast ordained.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him: and the son of man, that thou visitest
him?
Thou madest him lower than the angels: to crown him with glory and worship.
Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands: and thou hast put
all things in subjection under his feet;
All sheep and oxen: yea, and the beasts of the field;
The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and whatsoever walketh through
the paths of the seas.
O Lord our Governor: how excellent is thy Name in all the world!

<h3>Psalm9</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the secrets of the Son
I WILL give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will speak of all thy
marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O thou
most Highest.
While mine enemies are driven back: they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in the throne that
judgest right.
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly: thou hast put out
their name for ever and ever.
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: even as the cities which
thou hast destroyed, their memorial is perished with them.
But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath also prepared his seat for judgement.
For he shall judge the world in righteousness: and minister true judgement unto
the people.
The Lord also will be a defence for the oppressed: even a refuge in due time of
trouble.
And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast
never failed them that seek thee.
O praise the Lord which dwelleth in Sion: show the people of his doings.
For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them :and forgetteth
not the complaint of the poor.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider the trouble which I suffer of them that
hate me: thou that liftest me up from the gates of death.
That I may shew all thy praises within the ports of the daughter of Sion: I will
rejoice in thy salvation.
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the same net which they
hid privily, is their foot taken.
The Lord is known to execute judgement: the ungodly is trapped in the work of
his own hands.
The wicked shall be turned into hell: and all the people that forget God.
For the poor shall not always be forgotten: the patient abiding of the meek shall
not perish for ever.
Up, Lord, and let not man have the upper hand: let the heathen be judged in thy
sight.
Put them in fear, O Lord: that the heathen may know themselves to be but men.
Why standest thou so far off, O Lord: and hidest thy face in the needful time of
trouble?
The ungodly for his own lust doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the
crafty wiliness that they have imagined.
For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire: and speaketh good of
the covetous, whom God abhorreth.
The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God ; neither is God in all his
thoughts.
His ways are always grievous: thy judgments are far above out of his sight, and
therefore defieth he all his enemies.
For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down: there shall no
harm happen unto me.
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is ungodliness
and vanity.
He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets: and privily in his lurking
dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.
For he lieth waiting secretly, even as a lion lurketh he in his den: that he may
ravish the poor.
He doth ravish the poor: when he getteth him into his net.
He falleth down, and humbleth himself: that the congregation of the poor may
fall into the hands of his captains.
He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face, and
he will never see it.
Arise, O Lord God, and lift up thine hand: forget not the poor.
Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God: while he doth say in his heart,
Tush, thou God carest not for it.
Surely thou hast seen it: for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong.
That thou mayest take the matter into thy hand: the poor committeth himself
unto thee; for thou art the helper of the friendless.
Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious: take away his ungodliness,
and thou shalt find none.
The Lord is King for ever and ever: and the heathen are perished out of the land.
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the poor: thou preparest their heart, and
thine ear hearkeneth thereto;
To help the fatherless and poor unto their right: that the man of the earth be no
more exalted against them.
<h3>Psalm10</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
IN THE Lord put I my trust: how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a
bird unto the hill?
For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the
quiver: that they may privily shoot at them which are true of heart.
For the foundations will be cast down: and what have the righteous done?
The Lord is in his holy temple: the Lord's seat is in heaven.
His eyes consider the poor: and his eye-lids try the children of men.
The Lord alloweth the righteous: but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in
wickedness, doth his soul abhor.
Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest:
this shall be their portion to drink.
For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness: his countenance will behold the
thing that is just
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Second Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm11</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David, upon the eighth
HELP me, Lord, for there is not one godly man left: for the faithful are minished
from among the children of men,
They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour: they do but flatter with their
lips, and dissemble in their double heart.
The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips: and the tongue that speaketh proud
things;
Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail: we are they that ought to
speak , who is lord over us?
Now for the comfortless trouble's sake of the needy: and because of the deep
sighing of the poor,
I will up, saith the Lord: and will help every one from him that swelleth against
him, and will set him at rest.
The words of the Lord are pure words: even as the silver, which from the earth is
tried, and purified seven times in the fire.
Thou shalt keep them, O Lord: thou shalt preserve him from this generation for
ever.
The ungodly walk on every side: when they are exalted, the children of men are
put to rebuke.
<h3>Psalm12</h3>
For the end, psalm of David
HOW long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever: how long wilt thou hide thy face
from me?
How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart: how long
shall mine enemies triumph over me?
Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in
death.
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: for if I be cast down, they
that trouble me will rejoice at it.
But my trust is in thy mercy: and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.
I will sing of the Lord, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me: yea, I will
praise the Name of the Lord most Highest.
<h3>Psalm13</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE fool hath said in his heart: There is no God.
They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings: there is none that
doeth good, no not one.
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men: to see if there
were any that would understand, and seek after God.
But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable:
there is none that doeth good, no not one.
Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have they deceived: the
poison of asps is under their lips.
Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood.
Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they not
known ; there is no fear of God before their eyes.
Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief: eating up my
people as it were bread, and call not upon the Lord?
There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was: for God is in the
generation of the righteous.
As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor: because he putteth
his trust in the Lord.
Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? When the Lord turneth the
captivity of his people: then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
</div>
      
        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm14</h3>
A psalm of David
LORD, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle: or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?
Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life: and doeth the thing which is right, and
speaketh the truth from his heart.
He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour: and
hath not slandered his neighbour.
He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes: and maketh much of
them that fear the Lord.
He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not: thou it were to
his own hindrance.
He that hath not given his money upon usury: nor taken reward against the
innocent.
Whoso doeth these things: shall never fall.
<h3>Psalm15</h3>
A writing of David
PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee have I put my trust.
O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, my goods are nothing
unto thee.
All my delight is upon the saints, that are in the earth: and upon such as excel in
virtue.
But they that run after another god: shall have great trouble.
Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer: neither make mention of their
names within my lips.
The Lord himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou shalt
maintain my lot.
The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will thank the Lord for giving me warning: my reins also chasten me in the
night-season.
I have set God always before me: for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not
fall.
Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiced: my flesh also shall rest in
hope.
For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell: neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy
One to see corruption.
Thou shalt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is the fulness of joy: and at
thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.
<h3>Psalm16</h3>
A prayer of David
HEAR the right, O Lord, consider my complaint: and hearken unto my prayer,
that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence: and let thine eyes look upon the
thing that is equal.
Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night-season; thou hast tried me,
and shalt find no wickedness in me; for I am utterly purposed that my
mouth shall not offend.
Because of men's works, that are done against the words of thy lips: I have kept
me from the ways of the destroyer.
O hold thou up my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps slip not.
I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: incline thine ear to me,
and hearken unto my words.
Shew thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which
put their trust in thee: from such as resist thy right hand.
Keep me as the apple of an eye: hide me under the shadow of thy wings.
From the ungodly that trouble me: mine enemies compass me round about to
take away my soul.
They are enclosed in their own fat: and their mouth speaketh proud things.
They lie waiting in our way on every side: turning their eyes down to the ground.
Like of a lion that is greedy of his prey: and as it were a lion's whelp. lurking in
secret places.
Up, Lord, disappoint him, and cast him down: deliver my soul from the ungodly,
which is a sword of thine;
From the men of thy hand, O Lord, from the men, I say, and from the evil world:
which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid
treasure.
They have children at their desire: and leave the rest of their substance for their
babes.
But as for me, I will behold thy presence in righteousness: and when I awake up
after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied with it.</div>

<h3>Psalm 17</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David the servant of the Lord. The words which he spoke to the Lord,
even the words of this song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his
enemies, and out of the hand of Saul. And he said:
I WILL love thee, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my stony rock, and my
defence: my saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust, my
buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.
I will call upon the Lord, which is worthy to be praised: so shall I be safe from
mine enemies.
The sorrows of death compassed me: and the overflowings of ungodliness made
me afraid.
The pains of hell came about me: the snares of death overtook me.
In my trouble I will call upon the Lord: and complain unto my God.
So shall he hear my voice out of his holy temple: and my complaint shall come
before him, it shall enter even into his ears.
The earth trembled and quaked: the very foundations also of the hills shook, and
were removed, because he was wroth.
There went a smoke out in his presence: and a consuming fire out of his mouth,
so that coals were kindled at it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and it was dark under his feet.
He rode upon the cherubim, and did fly: he came flying upon the wings of the
wind.
He made darkness his secret place: his pavilion round about him, with dark
water and thick clouds to cover him.
At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed: hail-stones and coals of
fire.
The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hailstones and coals of fire.
He sent out his arrows, and scattered them: he cast forth lightnings, and
destroyed them.
The springs of water were seen, and the foundations of the round world were
discovered, at thy chiding, O Lord: at the blasting of the breath of thy
displeasure.
He shall send down from on high to fetch me: and shall take me out of many
waters.
He shall deliver from me my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me: for
they are too mighty for me.
They prevented me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my upholder.
He brought me forth also into a place of liberty: he brought me forth even
because he had a favour unto me.
The Lord shall reward me after my righteous dealing: according to the cleanness
of my hands shall he recompense me.
Because I have kept the ways of the Lord: and have not forsaken my God, as the
wicked doth.
For I have an eye unto all his laws: and will not cast out his commandments from
me.
I was also uncorrupt before him: and eschewed mine own wickedness.
Therefore shall the Lord reward me after my righteous dealing: and according
unto the cleanness of my hands in his eye-sight.
With the holy thou shalt be holy: and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.
With the clean thou shalt be clean: and with the froward thou shalt learn
frowardness.
For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity: and shalt bring down the
high looks of the proud.
Thou also shalt light my candle: the Lord my God shall make my darkness to be
light.
For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men: and with the help of my God I shall
leap over the wall.
The way of God is an undefiled way: the word of the Lord also is tried in the fire;
he is the defender of all them that put their trust in him.
For who is God, but the Lord: or who hath any strength, except our God?
It is God, that girdeth me with strength of war: and maketh my way perfect.
He maketh my feet like harts' feet: and setteth me up on high.
He teacheth mine hands to fight: and mine arms shall break even a bow of steel.
Thou hast given me the defence of my salvation: thy right hand also shall hold
me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.
Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go: that my footsteps shall not
slide.
I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them: neither will I turn again till I
have destroyed them.
I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand: but fall under my feet.
Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou shalt throw done mine
enemies under me.
Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me: and I shall
destroy them that hate me.
They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them: yea, even unto the Lord
shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.
I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I will cast them out as the
clay in the streets.
Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people: and thou shalt make me
the head of the heathen.
A people whom I have not known: shall serve me.
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: but the strange children shall
dissemble with me.
The strange children shall fail: and be afraid out of their prisons.
The Lord liveth, and blessed be my strong helper: and praised be the Lord of my
salvation.
Even the God that seeth that I be avenged: and subdueth the people unto me.
It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine
adversaries: thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.
For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles: and sing
praises unto thy Name.
Great prosperity giveth he unto his King: and showeth loving-kindness unto
David his Anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.

<h3>Psalm 18</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament showeth his
handiwork.
One day telleth another: and one night certifieth another.
There is neither speech nor language: but their voices are heard among them.
Their sound is gone out into all lands: and their words into the ends of the world.
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun: which cometh forth as a
bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.
It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the
end of it again: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, converting the soul: the testimony of the
Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.
The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart: the commandment of
the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever: the judgments of the Lord
are true, and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also
than honey, and the honey-comb.
Moreover, by them is thy servant taught: and in keeping of them there is great
reward.
Who can tell how oft he offendeth: O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.
Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion over
me: so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart: be alway
acceptable in thy sight,
O Lord: my strength, and my redeemer.
<h3>Psalm 19</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the Name of the God of Jacob defend
thee;
Send thee help from the sanctuary: and strengthen thee out of Sion;
Remember all thy offerings: and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
Grant thee thy heart's desire: and fulfil all thy mind.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God:
the Lord perform all thy petitions.
Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Anointed, and will hear him from his holy
heaven: even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.
Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the
Name of the Lord our God.
They are brought down, and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, Lord and hear us, O King of heaven: when we call upon thee.
<h3>Psalm 20</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David
THE King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be of thy
salvation.
Thou hast given him his heart's desire: and hast not denied him the request of
his lips.
For thou shalt prevent him with the blessings of goodness: and shalt set a crown
of pure gold upon his head.
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him a long life: even for ever and ever.
His honour is great in thy salvation: glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon
him.
For thou shalt give him everlasting felicity: and make him glad with the joy of thy
countenance.
And why? because the King putteth his trust in the Lord: and in the mercy of the
most Highest he shall not miscarry.
All thine enemies shall feel thine hand: thy right hand shall find out them that
hate thee.
Thou shalt make them like a fiery oven in time of thy wrath: the Lord shall
destroy them in his displeasure, and the fire shall consume them.
Their fruit shalt thou root out of the earth: and their seed from among the
children of men.
For they intended mischief against thee: and imagined such a device as they are
not able to perform.
Therefore shalt thou put them to flight: and the strings of thy bow shalt thou
make ready against the face of them.
Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so we will sing, and praise thy
power.

<h3>Psalm 21</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David concerning the morning aid.
MY GOD, my God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me: and art so far from
my health, and from the words of my complaint?
O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not: and in the night-season
also I take no rest.
And thou continuest holy: O thou worship of Israel.
Our fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them.
They called upon thee, and were holpen: they put their trust in thee, and were
not confounded.
But as for me, I am a worm, and no man: a very scorn of men, and the outcast of
the people.
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot our their lips, and shake their
heads, saying,
He trusted in God, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, if he will have
him.
But thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb: thou wast my hope, when
I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts.
I have been left unto thee ever since I was born: thou art my God, even from my
mother's womb.
O go not from me, for trouble is hard at hand: and there is none to help me.
Many oxen are come about me: fat bulls of Basan close me in on every side.
They gape upon me with their mouths: as it were a ramping and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart also in the
midst of my body is even like melting wax.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my gums: and
thou shalt bring me into the dust of death.
For many dogs are come about me: and the council of the wicked layeth siege
against me.
They pierced my hands and my feet; I may tell all my bones: they stand staring
and looking upon me.
They part my garments among them: and casts lots upon my vesture.
But be not thou far from me, O Lord: thou art my succour, haste thee to help me.
Deliver my soul from the sword: my darling from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth: thou hast heard me also from among the horns of
the unicorns.
I will declare thy Name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I
praise thee.
O praise the Lord, ye that fear him: magnify him, all ye of the seed of Jacob, and
fear him, all ye seed of Israel.
For he hath not despised, nor abhorred, the low estate of the poor: he hath not
hid his face from him, but when he called unto him he heard him.
My praise is of thee in the great congregation: my vows will I perform in the
sight of them that fear him.
The poor shall eat and be satisfied: they that seek after the Lord shall praise him;
your heart shall live for ever.
All the ends of the world shall remember themselves, and be turned unto the
Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him.
For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the Governor among the people.
All such as be fat upon earth: have eaten and worshipped.
All they that go down into the dust shall kneel before him: and no man hath
quickened his own soul.
My seed shall serve him: they shall be counted unto the Lord for a generation.
They shall come, and the heavens shall declare his righteousness: unto a people
that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made.
<h3>Psalm 22</h3>
A psalm of David
THE Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside the waters of
comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness, for
his Name's sake.
Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort me.
Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them that trouble me: thou hast
anointed my head with oil, and my cup shall be full.
But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
<h3>Psalm 23</h3>
A psalm of David on the first day of the week
THE earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and
they that dwell therein.
For he hath founded it upon the seas: and prepared it upon the floods.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall rise up in his holy place?
Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart: and that hath not lift up his
mind unto vanity, nor sworn to deceive his neighbour.
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord: and righteousness from the God of
his salvation.
This is the generation of them that seek him: even of them that seek thy face, O
Jacob.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: it is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord mighty
in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors: and the
King of glory shall come in.
Who is the King of glory: even the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.

<h3>Psalm 24</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee, O Lord, will I lift up my soul; my God, I have put my trust in thee: O
let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies triumph over me.
For all they that hope in thee shall not be ashamed: but such as transgress
without a cause shall be put to confusion.
Shew me thy ways, O Lord: and teach me thy paths.
Lead me forth in thy truth, and learn me: for thou art the God of my salvation; in
thee hath been my hope all the day long.
Call to remembrance, O Lord, thy tender mercies: and thy loving-kindnesses,
which have been ever of old.
O remember not the sins and offences of my youth: but according to thy mercy
think thou upon me, O Lord, for thy goodness.
Gracious and righteous is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
Them that are meek shall he guide in judgement: and such as are gentle, them
shall he learn his way.
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth: unto such as keep his covenant
and his testimonies.
For thy Name's sake, O Lord: be merciful unto my sin, for it is great.
What man is he that feareth the Lord: him shall he teach in the way that he shall
choose.
His soul shall dwell at ease: and his seed shall inherit the land.
The secret of the Lord is among them that fear him: and he will show them his
covenant.
Mine eyes are ever looking unto the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out of the
net.
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: for I am desolate and in misery.
The sorrows of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my troubles.
Look upon my adversity and misery: and forgive me all my sin.
Consider mine enemies, how many they are: and they bear a tyrannous hate
against me.
O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be confounded, for I have put my
trust in thee.
Let perfectness and righteous dealing wait upon me: for my hope hath been in
thee.
Deliver Israel, O God: out of all his troubles.
<h3>Psalm 25</h3>
A psalm of David
BE THOU my judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently: my trust hath been
also in the Lord, therefore shall I not fall.
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me: try out my reins and my heart.
For thy loving-kindness is ever before mine eyes: and I will walk in thy truth.
I have not dwelt with vain persons: neither will I have fellowship with the
deceitful.
I have hated the congregation of the wicked: and will not sit among the ungodly.
I will wash my hands in innocency, O Lord: and so will I go to thine altar.
That I may show the voice of thanksgiving: and tell of all thy wondrous works.
Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house: and the place where thine honour
dwelleth.
O shut not up my soul with the sinners: nor my life with the blood-thirsty.
In whose hands is wickedness: and their right hand is full of gifts.
But as for me, I will walk innocently: O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.
My foot standeth right: I will praise the Lord in the congregations.
<h3>Psalm 26</h3>
A psalm of David before he was anointed
THE Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom then shall I fear: the Lord is the
strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my
flesh: they stumbled and fell.
Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid:
and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.
One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may dwell
in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the fair beauty of
the Lord, and to visit his temple.
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle: yea, in the secret
place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone.
And now shall he lift up mine head: above mine enemies round about me.
Therefore will I offer in his dwelling an oblation with great gladness: I will sing,
and speak praises unto the Lord.
Hearken unto my voice, O Lord, when I cry unto thee: have mercy upon me, and
hear me.
My heart hath talked of thee, Seek ye my face: Thy face, Lord, will I seek.
O hide not thou thy face from me: nor cast thy servant away in displeasure.
Thou hast been my succour: leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me: the Lord taketh me up.
Teach me the way, O Lord: and lead in the right way, because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over into the will of mine adversaries: for there are false
witnesses risen up against me, and such as speak wrong.
I should utterly have fainted: but that I believe verily to see the goodness of the
Lord in the land of the living.
O tarry thou the Lord's leisure: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart ; and
put thou thy trust in the Lord.

<h3>Psalm 27</h3>
A psalm of David
UNTO thee will I cry, O Lord my strength: think no scorn of me; lest, if thou
make as though thou hearest not, I become like them that go down into the
pit.
Hear the voice of my humble petitions, when I cry unto thee: when I hold up my
hands towards the mercy-seat of thy holy temple.
O pluck me not away, neither destroy me, with the ungodly and wicked doers:
which speak friendly to their neighbours, but imagine mischief in their
hearts.
Reward them according to their deeds: and according to the wickedness of their
own inventions.
Recompense them after the work of their hands: pay them that they have
deserved.
For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his
hands: therefore shall he break them down, and not build them up.
Praised be the Lord: for he hath heard the voice of my humble petitions.
The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and I am
helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my song will I praise
him.
The Lord is my strength: and he is the wholesome defence of his Anointed.
O save thy people, and give thy blessing unto thine inheritance: feed them , and
set them up for ever.
<h3>Psalm 28</h3>
A psalm of David on the occasion of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle
BRING unto the Lord, O ye mighty, bring young rams unto the Lord: ascribe unto
the Lord worship and strength.
Give the Lord the honour due unto his Name: worship the Lord with holy
worship.
It is the Lord that commandeth the waters: it is the glorious God that maketh the
thunder.
It is the Lord that ruleth the sea; the voice of the Lord is mighty in operation: the
voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar-trees: yea, the Lord breaketh the
cedars of Libanus.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf: Libanus also, and Sirion, like a young
unicorn.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire; the voice of the Lord shaketh
the wilderness: yea, the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Cades.
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to bring forth young, and discovereth the
thick bushes: in his temple doth every man speak of his honour.
The Lord sitteth above the water -flood: and the Lord remaineth a King for ever.
The Lord shall give strength unto his people: the Lord shall give his people the
blessing of peace.
<h3>Psalm 29</h3>
For the end. A psalm of a song at the dedication of the house of David
I WILL magnify thee, O Lord, for thou hast set me up: and not made my foes to
triumph over me.
O Lord my God, I cried unto thee: and thou hast healed me.
Thou, Lord, hast brought my soul out of hell: thou hast kept my life from them
that go down to the pit.
Sing praises unto the Lord, O ye saints of his: and give thanks unto him for a
remembrance of his holiness.
For his wrath endureth but the twinkling of an eye, and in his pleasure is life:
heaviness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be removed: thou, Lord, of thy
goodness hast made my hill so strong.
Thou didst turn thy face from me: and I was troubled.
Then cried I unto thee, O Lord: and gat me to my Lord right humbly.
What profit is there in my blood: when I go down to the pit?
Shall the dust give thanks unto thee: or shall it declare thy truth?
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.
Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and
girded me with gladness.
Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing: O my God, I
will give thanks unto thee for ever.

<h3>Psalm 30</h3>
For the end. A psalm of David; an utterance of extreme fear
IN THEE, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion, deliver
me in thy righteousness.
Bow down thine ear to me: make haste to deliver me.
And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence: that thou mayest save me.
For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: be thou also my guide, and lead me
for thy Name's sake.
Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my
strength.
Into thy hands I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou
God of truth.
I have hated them that hold of superstitious vanities: and my trust hath been in
the Lord.
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble, and
hast known my soul in adversities.
Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: but hast set my feet in a
large room.
Have mercy upon me, O Lord , for I am in trouble: and mine eye is consumed for
very heaviness; yea, my soul and my body.
For my life is waxen old with heaviness: and my years with mourning.
My strength faileth me, because of mine iniquity: and my bones are consumed.
I became a reproof among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours: and they of mine acquaintance were afraid of me; and they
that did see me without conveyed themselves from me.
I am clean forgotten, as a dead man out of mind: I am become like a broken
vessel.
For I have heard the blasphemy of the multitude: and fear is on every side, while
they conspire together against me, and take their counsel to take away my
life.
But my hope hath been in thee, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my God.
My time is in thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies: and from
them that persecute me.
Shew thy servant the light of thy countenance: and save me for thy mercy's sake.
Let me not be confounded, O Lord for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be
put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.
Let the lying lips be put to silence: which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully,
speak against the righteous.
O how plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee:
and that thou hast prepared for them that put their trust in thee, even
before the sons of men!
Thou shalt hide them privily by thine own presence from the provoking of all
men: thou shalt keep them secretly in thy tabernacle from the strife of
tongues.
Thanks be to the Lord: for he hath shewed me marvellous great kindness in a
strong city.
And when I made haste, I said: I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes.
Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my prayer: when I cried unto thee.
26.O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth them that are
faithful, and plenteously rewardeth the proud doer.
Be strong, and he shall establish your heart: all that ye put your trust in the
Lord.
<h3>Psalm 31</h3>
A psalm of instruction by David
BLESSED is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven: and whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth no sin: and in whose spirit
there is no guile.
For while I held my tongue: my bones consumed away through my daily
complaining.
For thy hand is heavy upon me day and night: and my moisture is like the
drought in summer.
I will acknowledge my sin unto thee: and mine unrighteousness have I not hid.
I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord: and so thou forgavest the wickedness
of my sin.
For this shall every one that is godly make his prayer unto thee, in a time when
thou mayest be found: but in the great water-floods they shall not come
nigh him.
Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shalt preserve me from trouble: thou shalt
compass me about with songs of deliverance.
I will inform thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shalt go: and I will
guide thee with mine eyes.
Be ye not like to horse and mule, which have no understanding: whose mouths
must be held with bit and bridle. lest they fall upon thee.
Great plagues remain for the ungodly: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord,
mercy embraceth him on every side.
Be glad, O ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord: and be joyful, all ye that are true
of heart.

<h3>Psalm 32</h3>
A psalm of David
REJOICE in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to be thankful.
Praise the Lord with harp: sing praises unto him with the lute, and instrument of
ten strings.
Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing praises lustily unto him with a good
courage.
For the word of the Lord is true: and all his works are faithful.
He loveth righteousness and judgement: the earth is full of the goodness of the
Lord.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the hosts of them by the
breath of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were upon an heap: and layeth
up the deep, as in a treasure-house.
Let all the earth fear the Lord: stand in awe of him, all ye that dwell in the world.
For he spake, and it was done: he commanded and it stood fast.
The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: and maketh the devices
of the people to be of none effect, and casteth out the counsels of princes.
The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever: and the thoughts of his heart from
generation to generation.
Blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord Jehovah: and blessed are the folk,
that he hath chosen to him to be his inheritance.
The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the children of men: from the
habitation of his dwelling he considereth all them that dwell on the earth.
He fashioneth all the hearts of them: and understandeth all their works.
There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of an host: neither is any
mighty man delivered by much strength.
A horse is counted but a vain thing to save a man: neither shall he deliver any
man by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him: and upon them that put
their trust in his mercy.
To deliver their soul from death: and to feed them in the time of dearth.
Our soul hath patiently tarried for the Lord: for he is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in him: because we have hoped in his holy Name.
Let thy merciful kindness, O Lord, be upon us: like as we do put our trust in thee.
<h3>Psalm 33</h3>
A psalm of David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech, and he was dismissed
and departed
I WILL alway give thanks unto the Lord: his praise shall ever be in my mouth.
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be
glad.
O praise the Lord with me: and let us magnify his Name together.
I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he delivered me out of all my fear.
They had an eye unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
ashamed.
Lo, the poor crieth, and the Lord heareth him: yea, and saveth him out of all his
troubles.
The angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him: and delivereth
them.
O taste, and see, how gracious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusteth in
him.
O fear the Lord, ye that are his saints: for they that fear him lack nothing.
The lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they who seek the Lord shall want no
manner of thing that is good.
Come, ye children, and hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
What man is he that lusteth to live: and would fain see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil: and thy lips, that they speak no guile.
Eschew evil, and do good: seek peace, and ensue it.
The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous: and his ears are open unto their
prayers.
The countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil: to root out the
remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth them: and delivereth them out of all
their troubles.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and will save such as be
of an humble spirit.
Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of all.
He keepeth all his bones: so that not one of them is broken.
But misfortune shall slay the ungodly: and they that hate the righteous shall be
desolate.
The Lord delivereth the souls of his servants: and all they that put their trust in
him shall not be destitute.

<h3>Psalm 34</h3>
A psalm of David
PLEAD thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: and fight thou
against them that fight against me.
Lay hand upon the shield and buckler: and stand up to help me.
Bring forth the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto
my soul, I am thy salvation.
Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seek after my soul :let them be
turned back and brought to confusion, that imagine mischief for me.
Let them be as the dust before the wind: and the angel of the Lord scattering
them.
Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord persecute them.
For they have privily laid their net to destroy me without a cause: yea, even
without a cause have they made a pit for my soul.
Let a sudden destruction come upon him unawares, and his net, that he hath laid
privily, catch himself: that he may fall into his own mischief.
And, my soul, be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, who deliverest the poor from
him that is too strong for him: yea, the poor, and him that is in misery, from
him that spoileth him?
False witnesses did rise up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
They rewarded me evil for good: to the great discomfort of my soul.
Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with
fasting.: and my prayer shall turn into mine own bosom.
I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother: I went heavily,
as one that mourneth for his mother.
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the
very abjects came together against me unawares, making mouths at me,
and ceased not.
With the flatterers were busy mockers: who gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, how long wilt though look upon this: O deliver my soul from the calamities
which they bring on me, and my darling from the lions.
So will I give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among
much people.
O let not them that are mine enemies triumph over me ungodly: neither let them
wink with their eyes that they hate me without a cause.
And why? their communing is not for peace; but they imagine deceitful words
against them that are quiet in the land.
They gaped upon me with their mouths, and said: Fie on thee, fie on thee, we
saw it with our eyes.
This thou hast seen, O Lord: hold not thy tongue then, go not far from me, O
Lord.
Awake, and stand up to judge my quarrel: avenge thou my cause, my God, and
my Lord.
Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness: and let them not
triumph over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, There, there, so would we have it: neither let
them say, We have devoured him.
Let them be put to confusion and shame together, that rejoice at my trouble: let
them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour, that boast themselves against
me.
Let them be glad and rejoice, that favour my righteous dealing: yea, let them say
alway, Blessed be the Lord, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
servant.
And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of thy righteousness: and of thy praise
all the day long.
<h3>Psalm 35</h3>
For the end. By David the servant of the Lord
MY HEART sheweth me the wickedness of the ungodly: that there is no fear of
God before his eyes.
For he flattereth himself in his own sight: until his abominable sin be found out.
The words of his mouth are unrighteous, and full of deceit: he hath left off to
behave himself wisely, and to do good.
He imagineth mischief upon his bed, and hath set himself in no good way:
neither doth he abhor any thing that is evil.
Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth unto the heavens: and thy faithfulness unto the
clouds.
Thy righteousness standeth like the strong mountains: thy judgments are like the
great deep.
Thou, Lord, shalt save both man and beast; How excellent is thy mercy, O God:
and the children of men shall put their trust under the shadow of thy
wings.
They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of thy house: and thou shalt give
them drink of thy pleasures, as out of the river.
For with thee is the well of life: and in thy light shall we see light.
O continue forth thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee: and thy
righteousness unto them that are true of heart.
O let not the foot of pride come against me: and let not the hand of the ungodly
cast me down.
There are they fallen, all that work wickedness: they are cast down, and shall not
be able to stand.

        <div><h4>Third Stasis</h4>
<h3>Psalm 36</h3>
A psalm of David
FRET not thyself because of the ungodly: neither be thou envious against the
evil-doers.
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass: and be withered even as the
green herb.
Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good: dwell in the land, and verily
thou shalt be fed.
Delight thou in the Lord: and he shall give thee thy heart's desire.
Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him: and he shall bring it to
pass.
He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light ; and thy just dealing as the
noon-day.
Hold thee still in the Lord, and abide patiently upon him: but grieve not thyself at
him whose way doth prosper, against the man that doeth after evil
counsels.
Leave off from wrath, and let go displeasure: fret not thyself, else shalt thou be
moved to do evil.
Wicked doers shall be rooted out: and they that patiently abide the Lord, those
shall inherit the land.
Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone: thou shalt look after his
place, and he shall be away.
But the meek-spirited shall possess the earth: and shall be refreshed in the
multitude of peace.
The ungodly seeketh counsel against the just: and gnasheth upon him with his
teeth.
The Lord shall laugh him to scorn: for he hath seen that his day is coming.
The ungodly have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow: to cast down
the poor and needy, and to slay such as are of a right conversation.
Their sword shall go through their own heart: and their bow shall be broken.
A small thing that the righteous hath: is better than great riches of the ungodly.
For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken: and the Lord upholdeth the
righteous.
The Lord knoweth the days of the godly: and their inheritance shall endure for
ever.
They shall not be confounded in the perilous time: and in the days of dearth they
shall have enough.
As for the ungodly, they shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord shall consume
as the fat of lambs: yea, even as the smoke shall they consume away.
The ungodly borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous is merciful and
liberal.
Such as are blessed of God shall possess the land: and they that are cursed of
him shall be rooted out.
The Lord ordereth a good man's going: and maketh his way acceptable to
himself.
Though he fall, he shall not be cast away: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
hand.
I have been young, and now am old: and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging their bread.
The righteous is ever merciful, and lendeth: and his seed is blessed.
Flee from evil, and do the thing that is good: and dwell for evermore.
For the Lord loveth the thing that is right: he forsaketh not his that be godly, but
they are preserved for ever.
The unrighteous shall be punished: as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be
rooted out.
The righteous shall inherit the land: and dwell therein forever.
The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wisdom: and his tongue will be talking
of judgement.
The law of his God is in his heart: and his goings shall not slide.
The ungodly seeth the righteous: and seeketh occasion to slay him.
The Lord will not leave him in his hand: nor condemn him when he is judged.
Hope thou in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall promote thee, that thou
shalt possess the land: when the ungodly shall perish, thou shalt see it.
I myself have seen the ungodly in great power: and flourishing like a green baytree.
I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him, but his place could no where be
found.
Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right: for that shall bring a
man peace at the last.
As for the transgressors, they shall perish together: and the end of the ungodly
is, they shall be rooted out at the last.
But the salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord: who is also their strength
in the time of trouble.
And the Lord shall stand by them, and save them: he shall deliver them from the
ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him.

        <p><i class="note">Stichera of compunction, in Tone III:</i></p>Gather the scattered thoughts of my mind, O Lord, and purify my barren and 
wasted heart, granting me repentance as didst Thou to Peter, that like the Publican 
I may sigh in sorrow, and like the Harlot shed tears, that I may cry with a loud 
voice unto Thee: Save me, O God, for Thou alone art compassionate and the 
Lover of mankind. 
</p></p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, O Lord, and we 
rejoiced and were glad.<p> In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein 
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon 
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons. 
While offering a multitude of hymns, I am found to be sinning; for chanting 
hymns with my tongue, my soul doth dwell on wicked thoughts. * But do Thou, 
O Christ God set both aright through repentance, and have mercy upon me.  
</p><p><i class="note">Verse:</i> And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the 
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our 
hands do Thou guide aright. 
</p><p><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Come, O ye people, and let us all honor the memory of the 
holy passion-bearers; for, having been a spectacle for angels and men, they 
received crowns of victory from Christ, and pray on behalf of our souls. 
</p><p>Glory ..., Now & Ever ...,</p><p></p><p><i class="note">Theotokion:</i> 
O pure Lady of the originate holiness, who art the boast of the heavenly ranks, 
the subject of the apostles’ hymnody and the fulfillment of the prophets, accept 
our supplications.

          <p><i class="note">*</i>Thou didst banish from paradise our forefather Adam, who had broken Thy commandment, O Christ; but Thou didst cause to dwell therein the thief who confessed Thee on the cross, crying: Remember me, O Savior, in Thy kingdom!</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i>Overlooking the multitude of mine evils in the multitude of Thy mercy, O Christ, save me, and on the dread day of condemnation deliver me from everlasting torment, O Savior, that I may hymn Thy goodness.</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i>O ye cherubim and seraphim, ye thrones, archangels, powers, principalities, dominions, angels and all authorities, entreat the Creator, that, in that He is the Lover of mankind, He overlook mine offenses when He shall come to judge the earth.</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i><i class="note">To the Martyrs:</i> Having dyed vesture for themselves in their sacred blood, in a godly manner the spiritual athletes of Christ were truly deemed worthy to reign with the King of the heavenly hosts; and they ask remission of transgressions for us who ever honor them as is meet.</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i>O ye faithful, piously hymning the one Godhead in three Hypostases: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the Comforter: with the angels let us cry out unceasingly with our voices: Holy, holy, holy art Thou, O God Who savest our souls!</p>
        
          <p><i class="note">*</i>O pure one, thou radiant cloud, who hast given birth to the Light from Light: Guiding to the Light me who have been darkened by the passions and pleasures of life, set me aright, and pray that I may receive the glory which those who lived righteously have now received.</p>
