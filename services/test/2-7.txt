FRIDAY EVENING: TONE II
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...” these Stichera of the Saints, in Tone II:
Spec. Mel.: “When from the Tree ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
Giving your flesh over to wounds * and enduring the most bitter torments and
a violent death, * О all-praised martyrs, * ye put the tyrants to shame * and truly
abolished the worship of idols, * preaching Christ, the one God and Master, *
before Whom ye stand crowned, * О glorious ones, ** together with the angelic
hosts.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
Giving your flesh over to wounds ...,
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
Ye revealed yourselves to be * divine preachers of the Word * Who appeared
on earth, and taught piety to all, * setting forth Orthodoxy in divine words, *
whereby ye drove heresy far from the Church of Christ. * Wherefore О blessed
ones, * ye ever dwell in the habitations of God, * as sacred ministers of the
Trinity, ** ye lead thereto all mankind.
Then these other Stichera, of the martyrs, in the same tone:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
Having no desire * for earthly pleasure, * O ye passion-bearers, * ye were
granted heavenly blessings, * and became fellow-citizens with the angels. * By
their prayers, O Lord, * have mercy on us, ** and save us.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
When the holy martyrs * pray for us and hymn Christ, * all deception ceaseth,
* and the human race ** is saved by faith.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
The choir of martyrs resisted the tyrants, saying: * “We war on behalf of the
King of the powers on high; * though ye give us up to fire and torment, * we shall
not deny ** the power of the Trinity.”
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Dogmatic Theotokion, in the same tone:
The shadow of the law hath passed now that grace hath come, * for as the
Bush wrapped in flame was not consumed, * so didst thou bear a Child O Virgin
* and remained a Virgin; * in place of a pillar of fire, the Sun of righteousness hath
dawned, * instead of Moses, Christ is come, ** the salvation of our souls.
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone VII:
Prokeimenon: O God, my helper art Thou, * and Thy mercy shall go
before me.
Verse: Rescue me from mine enemies, O God, and from them that rise up
against me redeem me.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, these Stichera, in Tone II:
To the Martyrs: O ye saints, great is the glory, ye have acquired through Faith.
For by your sufferings ye not only vanquished the enemy; but even in death, O
physicians of body and soul, ye drive out evil spirits and heal the infirm; Pray ye to
the Lord, that our souls find mercy.
Verse: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, О
Lord
For the reposed: Every man fadeth like a flower and passeth by like a shadow,
and is no more; but when the trumpet shall sound, in the midst of an earthquake
all the dead shall arise to meet Thee, О Christ God. Then, О Master, do Thou
settle in the abodes of the saints the souls of Thy servants whom Thou hast taken
from among us.
Verse: Their souls * shall dwell among good things.
For the reposed: Woe is me! How great a struggle the soul endureth at its
parting from the body. Alas! How many tears will it then shed? Yet there will be
none to have mercy on it. Raising its eyes to the angels, it supplicates in vain;
stretching forth its hands to men, it finds none to help. Wherefore, my beloved
brethren, reflecting on the shortness of our life, let us ask of Christ rest for the
departed and great mercy for our souls.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Save from misfortunes, * thy servants O Virgin Theotokos, * for after God *
it is to thee that we flee, ** as to an impregnable rampart and protection.
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

three children spurned the impious command, * and, cast into the midst of

By the power of the Most Holy Spirit thou hast given flesh to the noetic Son
Who is of the same nature as the Father, О Lady full of the grace of God.

the flesh, * O ye faithful with never silent hymns let us magnify Him.
Shown to be mighty against the passions and powerful against the enemy, О
passion-bearers, having contended lawfully ye took the prize and were crowned by
God.
As godly sacred ministers and emulators of the good Shepherd, О divinely
glorious primates, ye tended His sheep in holiness.

entreat Thee, О Lord: Show forth as sharers in everlasting life those in the Faith,

Theotokos, following thy divinely inspired words; for unto mortals thou alone
hast given birth to God, Who destroyed the power of death, О Virgin Mother.

On the Praises, these Stichera of the martyrs, in Tone II:
Verse: Praise Him for His mighty acts, * praise Him according to the
multitude of His greatness.
To the Martyrs: Ye suffered for Christ’s sake unto death, O passion-bearers,
and though your souls dwell in the hand of God in the heavens, your relics are
venerated throughout the whole world; Priests and all the people venerate them,
and rejoicing with them we cry aloud: precious in the sight of the Lord is the
death of His saints.
Verse: Praise Him with the sound of trumpet, * praise Him with the
psaltery and harp.
Every city and land doth honor your relics, O passion-bearers. For, striving
lawfully for the prize, ye have received crowns from heaven; wherefore ye are the
boast of hierarchs, and the majesty of the Church.
Verse: Praise Him with timbrel and dance, * praise him with strings and
flute.
О holy martyrs, taking up the Cross of Christ as an ensign of victory, ye set at
naught all the power of the devil; and receiving heavenly crowns, ye have become
bulwarks for us, praying to the Lord on our behalf.

jubilation. * Let every breath praise the Lord.
For the reposed: Woe is me! How great a struggle the soul endureth at its
parting from the body. Alas! How many tears will it then shed? Yet there will be
none to have mercy on it. Raising its eyes to the angels, it supplicates in vain;
stretching forth its hands to men, it finds none to help. Wherefore, my beloved
brethren, reflecting on the shortness of our life, let us ask of Christ rest for the
departed and great mercy for our souls.
Glory ...,
For the reposed: From the earth hast Thou formed me, * and because of the
transgression Thou hast condemned me to return to earth once more. * Thou hast
appointed a day of examination, * when each man’s hidden deeds shall stand
revealed before Thee. * Spare me then, O sinless Lord, * and grant me the
forgiveness of my sins, ** and shut me not out from Thy Kingdom.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Theotokion: Come, and with unceasing hymns let us all glorify the Mother of
the Light, for she hath given birth to our salvation; wherefore let us cry out “Rejoice!” to her who alone gave birth to the chief Cause of all: God Who is before

them worthy of Thine incorruptible glory, O Thou Lover of mankind.
Verse: Blessed are those whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself,
О Lord.

have passed over to Thee; and grant them Thy sweet beauty.
Verse: Their souls * shall dwell among good things.

with faith.
Verse: T heir memorial * is unto generation and generation.
Standing before Thy dread, terrible and awesome judgment seat, О Christ,

passed on to Thee in faith, in a place where the choirs of the saints are, and the
joy is ineffable.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
When my soul must needs sever its fleshly bond and depart this life, then
stand before me, О Lady. Set at naught the counsels of the incorporeal foe, and

may elude the myriad princes of darkness who inhabit the air, О Bride of God.
