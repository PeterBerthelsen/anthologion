THURSDAY EVENING: TONE IV

On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of the Cross, in Tone IV:
Spec. Mel.: “Thou hast, given a sign ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
When all creation beheld Thee crucified, it was changed and trembled: the
whole earth shook, quaking, О long-suffering Word; in fear the veil of the temple
rent in twain and in terror the rocks split asunder when Thou wast insulted; and
the sun, knowing Thee to be its Creator, hid its rays.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
How did the most iniquitous council dare to condemn Thee, О immortal
Judge, Who of old in the desert gave the law to Moses, who beheld God? How
could they fail to be filled with terror, beholding the Life of all dead upon the
Cross? How could their mind not fathom that Thou art the one Lord and Master
of creation?
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord,
With the piercing of Thy side, О greatly Merciful One, the ancient record of
our forefather Adam was rent asunder; and by the shedding of Thy blood rejected
human nature was sanctified, and cried aloud: Glory be to Thy loving-kindness!
Glory be to Thy divine crucifixion, О almighty Jesus, Thou Savior of our souls!
Then the Stichera of the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera, of the Most Holy Theotokos, in Tone IV:
Spec. Mel.: “As one valiant among the martyrs ...”:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
When she beheld Thee nailed to the Cross, О Lord, the Ewe-lamb, Thy
Mother, marveled and cried aloud: “What is this that I see, О my sweetest Son?
Thus art Thou repaid by the disobedient and iniquitous assembly, which enjoyed
Thy many miracles. But glory to Thine ineffable condescension, О Master!”
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
The foregoing Sticheron is repeated.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
When she beheld Thee, the Lamb and Shepherd, upon the Tree, the Ewe-lamb
who gave Thee birth lamented and exclaimed to Thee maternally: “O my most
beloved Son, how hast Thou been lifted up upon the tree of the Cross, О Longsuffering One? How have Thy hands and feet been pierced with nails by the
iniquitous, О Word? How hast Thou shed Thy blood, О Master?”
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: When she beheld Thee hanging upon the Cross, the Virgin
Thy Mother marveled, О Lord, and, lifting up her eyes, said: “How have they who
enjoyed Thy many gifts rewarded Thee, О Master? Yet I pray: Leave me not alone
in the world, but hasten Thou to arise, raising up our forefather with Thee!”
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone VI:
Prokeimenon: My help cometh from the Lord, * Who hath made heaven
and the earth.
Verse: I have lifted up mine eyes to the Mountains, from whence cometh
my help.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the Cross, in Tone IV:
Thou hast given Thy Cross to us as an invincible weapon, О Christ; and
therewith we triumph over the assaults of the alien one.
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
Ever possessing Thy Cross as a help, О Christ, we easily trample underfoot
the snares of the enemy.
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: О Christ God, Who art glorified in the memorials of Thy
saints, entreated by them send down upon us great mercy.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Spec. Mel.: “Called from on high... ”:
Stavrotheotokion: "Lament not for Me, O Mother, * beholding Me thy Son
and God hanging upon the Tree, * Who hath suspended the earth upon the
waters unsupported, * and hath fashioned all creation; * for I shall arise and be
glorified, * and shall crush the kingdoms of Hades with strength; * destroying its
power * and delivering those in bondage * from its wickedness, * for I am
compassionate; * and I shall bring them to My Father, ** in that I am the Lover of
mankind."

Having wasted my life in fornication and having committed every impure act,
I tremble before the judgment-seat, I tremble before the questioning, and I
tremble before my sentence of condemnation. О pure one, since thou hast given
birth to the Judge, stand before me then, and deliver me from necessity.
In thee have I placed all my hope of salvation, O Mother of God, who
knewest not wedlock, and I ever call upon thee for help: Save me from grief and
the temptations of the enemy, loose the bonds of mine evils, and rescue me from
everlasting darkness!
At the hour of mine end, О Virgin, rescue me from the hands of the demons,
from condemnation and retribution, from dreadful trials and the bitter toll-houses,
and from the cruel prince and everlasting damnation, О Mother of God.
О Virgin, preserve thy servants from the every assault of the alien, for thee do
I have as protection and help, refuge and confirmation, О Lady; and because of
thee I hope to be delivered from the snares of the enemy, О only intercessor for
the race of mankind.
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX
Canon of the Cross
Irmos: Let every mortal born on earth, * radiant with light, in spirit leap for
joy; * and let the host of the angelic powers * celebrate and honor the holy
feast of the Mother of God, * and let them cry aloud: * Rejoice! O
Theotokos, thou pure Ever-Virgin.
О Lover of mankind, Who wilt come to judge all mankind, Thou didst stand
condemned, and willingly desired to be crowned with the crown of thorns, О
Christ our Savior, uprooting the thorns of disobedience, and delighting all with
the knowledge of Thy loving-kindness.
О how can the iniquitous ones, darkened by envy, condemn Thee, the
righteous and blameless Judge, to the Cross, О Bestower of light? Seeing Thy 
suffering, the sun was darkened, the veil of the temple was rent in twain, and the
foundations of the earth trembled.
To the Martyrs: Ye conformed yourselves to the sufferings of Christ, О holy
martyrs, and became fellow heirs of the kingdom and splendor; wherefore,
enlighten us who hymn you, О most wise ones, freeing us from the gloom of sin
and divers evil circumstances.
To the Martyrs: Having already made your abode in the heavens, and received
everlasting glory, О most wise ones, deified by sacred communion, remember all
of us who with faith honor your all-sacred and honored memory, О ever-glorious
ones.
Theotokion: Enlighten those who with love hymn and magnify thee, О pure
Maiden, and dispel the darkness of our passions. Still the tempest of the evil one,
and by thy prayers drive away his temptations from among us, О Maiden.
Canon of the Theotokos
Irmos: Same as the foregoing.
Rejoice, О most pure one, who for those on earth hast truly given birth unto
Joy! Rejoice, haven of salvation and protection of those who have recourse unto
thee! Rejoice, О pure ladder who bearest up those who have fallen! Rejoice, О
most blessed Theotokos, thou hope of our souls!
By thy powerful prayer rid my defiled soul and body of the weeds of my sins,
О divinely joyous and most pure Lady, granting me the healing of salvation , the
divine fear of the Master, О all-immaculate one.
Thou art mine enlightenment, thou art my deliverance and joy, thou art mine
ally, thou art my glory and boast, my hope of salvation, О all-immaculate one; and
unto thee do I bow down with faith and cry aloud: Save me, thy wretched servant,
and rescue me from the gates of Hades.
Save me, О pure one, who hast given birth to the all-compassionate Savior!
Have pity on me, thy servant, and direct me to the ways of repentance! Repel
from me the temptations of the evil one, deliver me from his pursuit, and rescue
me from everlasting fire, О most immaculate one.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the Cross, in Tone IV:
Let Thy Cross be for us a bulwark, О Jesus our Savior; for we, the faithful,
have no other hope save Thee Who wast nailed to it in the flesh, granting us great
mercy.
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
Thou hast given a sign unto those who fear Thee, О Lord: Thy precious
Cross, whereby Thou didst put to shame the princes and rulers of darkness, and
restored us to our primal blessed state. Wherefore, we glorify Thy loving
dispensation, О almighty Jesus, Savior of our souls.
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: Who is not moved to awe, beholding the good fight which ye
fought, О holy martyrs: how, though in the flesh, ye vanquished the incorporeal
foe, confessing Christ and armed with the Cross? Wherefore, as is meet, ye were
shown to be expellers of the demons and victors over the barbarians, praying
unceasingly that our souls be saved.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Spec. Mel.: “As one valiant among the martyrs ...”:
Stavrotheotokion: Beholding Thee * nailed to the Cross, O Lord, * the ewelamb Thy Mother marveled * and cried out: “What is this that I see, * O my Son
most desired? How hast Thou been rewarded * by the unfaithful and iniquitous
assembly * which hath enjoyed Thy many miracles? ** Yet glory to Thine
ineffable condescension, O Master! ”
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON FRIDAY MORNING: TONE IV
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone IV:
Of old Adam was banished from paradise through the tree, but by the tree of
the Cross hath the thief come to dwell in paradise: the one by tasting rejected the
commandment of the Creator, but the other, crucified with Christ, confessed the
hidden God, crying aloud: Remember me in Thy kingdom!
Beholding Thee stretched out upon the Cross, О only Long-suffering One,
the hosts of heaven were at a loss and marveled; trembling, the earth quaked, О
Lover of mankind, and the beauty of the heavenly lights was extinguished when
Thou wast unjustly condemned; and Adam, who was condemned, was justified. I
glorify Thy loving-kindness!
Lifted up on Golgotha, thou didst crush the head of the enemy; and having
died on the Tree, О Master, Thou didst bring life to those who were slain by the
fruit of the tree, and didst cause to dwell in paradise those who unceasingly glorify
Thy goodness and cry aloud: Remember us in Thy kingdom!
To the Martyrs: Wielding the Cross as a weapon, О holy martyrs, with valiant
resolve ye went forth to engage the foe; and having destroyed them, ye were
crowned with a wreath of incorruption, and, rejoicing, have received higher glory,
О right blessed ones; wherefore, we bless you with faith.
Glory ..., That Thou mightest manifestly show us Thy loving-kindness toward
us, Thou wast nailed to the Cross, О Savior Who art one with the Father and the
Spirit; and Thou didst endure the sponge, the reed, mockery and stripes, desiring
to deliver from everlasting fire those who cry: Remember us, О Savior, in Thy
kingdom!
Now & ever ..., He Who is everywhere infinite and unconfined by space made
His abode within thy holy womb, О most pure Lady, Birthgiver of God; and,
suspended upon the Tree, He clearly poured forth life upon the world. Him do
thou beseech, that He mortify our carnal-mindedness, and that He save all, in that
He is the Lover of mankind.
On Friday, the Prokeimenon in Tone VII:
Prokeimenon, in Tone VII: Exalt ye the Lord our God, * and worship the
footstool of His feet, for He is holy.
