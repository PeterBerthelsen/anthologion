WEDNESDAY EVENING
AT VESPERS: TONE I
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of the holy apostles, in Tone I:
Spec. Mel.: “O all-praised martyrs ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
О glorious apostles, divinely chosen disciples of Christ, teachers of the whole
world, who found the Lord God, Who is the Mediator between God and
mankind: Unto Him did ye cleave in godliness, and throughout the world ye
manifestly preached Him as God and as a supremely perfect man.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
O most wise apostles, divinely chosen disciples of Christ, teachers of the
whole world: By your prayers strengthen me, that I may obey the teachings of
God; and ever help me to walk the narrow path, that I may achieve a most
spacious rest in paradise.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
I hymn as eyewitnesses and preachers of the Word Peter the first enthroned,
Paul and James, Andrew and Philip, Simon, Bartholomew and Thomas, Matthew
and John, and Mark and Luke who recorded the Gospels, who with the seventy
others are the divinely chosen choir.
Then the Stichera of the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion,
these Stichera of the great hierarch & wonderworker Nicholas, in the same
melody:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
Soaring aloft above the flowers of the Church, О thrice-blessed Nicholas, as a
fledgling from the angelic nest of the Most High thou ever callest unto God on
behalf of all the people who find themselves in the midst of violent tribulations
and temptations, delivering them by thy prayers.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
Ascending through the beauties of heaven, thou didst gaze upon the awesome
glory of the Holy of holies. Wherefore, thou dost ever disclose unto us heavenly
words of the vivifying sight thereof, О most sacred father.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
The adornment of priestly vestments didst thou render more splendid by thine
active virtues, О God-bearing father; wherefore, for us thou performest sacred
acts of wondrous miracles for the sake of Christ, delivering us from evils.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Tempest-tossed on the abyss of transgressions, * fleeing to the calm haven * of
thy most pure supplication, * I cry out to thee, O Birthgiver of God: ** Save me,
O all-immaculate one, extending thy mighty right hand unto thy servant!
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone V:

Thou judge me.
Verse: O God, hearken unto my prayer, give ear unto the words of my
mouth.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of apostles, in Tone I:
The harmonious harp of the apostles, played by the Holy Spirit, abolished the
abominable sacrifices of the demons; and, proclaiming the one Lord, it hath
delivered the nations from the delusion of idolatry, and taught them to worship
the consubstantial Trinity.
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
Together let us praise Peter and Paul, Luke and Matthew, Mark and John,
Andrew and Thomas, Bartholomew and Simon the Canaite, James and Philip; and
let us laud the whole choir of the disciples, as is meet.
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: О all-praised martyrs, the earth did not hide you, but heaven
received you, and unto you were opened the gates of paradise. And since ye have
entered therein, ye delight in the tree of life. Pray ye unto Christ, that He grant our
souls peace and great mercy.

Standing on the mountain of the godly virtues, by the showing forth of exalted
miracles thou didst become known unto the ends of the earth, О Nicholas;
wherefore, every tongue honoreth thee throughout all ages.
Having tasted of divine sweetness, О venerable one, thou didst hate the
bitterness of passions and pleasures. Deliver us from them, entreating Christ to

We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX
Canon of the Apostles
Irmos: The Bush, which burnt without being consumed, * prefigured thy
pure birthgiving, O Theotokos. * Wherefore we now entreat Thee: *
quench the raging furnace of temptations that beset us, * that we may
unceasingly magnify Thee.
Ye were shown to be divine and radiant lamps of the Holy Spirit, О blessed
ones, and by the splendor of your honorable and most wise preaching ye
illumined the whole world, driving away the darkness of the idols. (Twice)
As branches of the divine, noetic vine, ye produced the divine grapes which
pour forth the wine of salvation, О glorious apostles. Wherefore, deliver me from
the drunkenness of pleasures.
I tremble, wretch that I am, when I consider Thy dread judgment, О Christ;
for I am now clad in shameful and foul deeds, and am condemned even before
trial. Wherefore, through the supplications of Thine apostles have pity on me.
Theotokion: Thou alone didst deify mankind when thou didst give birth to the
incarnate Word. Him do thou entreat with the apostles and martyrs, О most pure
and all-immaculate Virgin, on behalf of us who bless and honor thee with faith.
Canon of Saint Nicholas
Irmos: The light-bearing cloud upon whom * the beginningless Master of
all descended from heaven, * like the dew upon the fleece, * and of whom
He was incarnate, * becoming a man for our sake, * let us all magnify as
the pure Mother of God.
With sacred hymns, О father, we praise thee as a holy hierarch of Christ, the
radiant star, the performer of miracles, the well-spring of healings, the helper of
those amid sorrows, the most fervent deliverer of those who call upon thee in
troubles.
We earnestly beseech thee, О Nicholas, the great shepherd and emulator of
Christ, the Chief Shepherd, in all things: From the sacred heights shepherd thy
servants, and deliver them ever from all the perils of life.
The end is already nigh! Wherefore art thou slothful, О my soul? Why dost
thou not strive to live a life pleasing unto God? Hasten thou, and arise henceforth,
and cry aloud: Have mercy upon me, О Lover of mankind, directing my life
through the supplications of Nicholas, in that Thou art good!
Theotokion: О all-immaculate one, who hast given birth to the divine Light,
enlighten me who am darkened by all the assaults of the evil one, for I dwell in
despondency, and anger God; and guide me to good works, in that thou art the
cause of all good things.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
Litany, Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the apostles, in Tone I:
О glorious apostles, who enlightened the whole world, ever entreat God, that
our souls may be saved.
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
Together let us praise Peter and Paul, Luke and Matthew, Mark and John,
Andrew and Thomas, Bartholomew and Simon the Canaanite, James and Philip;
and let us laud the whole choir of the disciples, as is meet.
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: Rejoice in the Lord, О ye martyrs, for ye fought the good
fight: ye opposed emperors and vanquished tyrants; ye were not daunted by fire
and the sword, nor by the wild beasts who devoured your bodies, but, sending up
hymnody to Christ with the angels, ye received crowns from heaven. Ask that He
grant peace to the world and great mercy to our souls.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Rejoice, О Virgin Theotokos! Rejoice, boast of the whole world! Rejoice, О
most pure and blessed Mother of God!
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON THURSDAY MORNING: TONE I
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone I:
By food the enemy led Adam out of paradise, but by the Cross Christ led back
into it the thief who cried out: Remember me, О Lord, when Thou comest in Thy
kingdom!
Enlightening the ends of the earth with the divine rays of your teachings, ye
destroyed the darkness of cruel ungodliness; and having come to the never-waning
Light, ye are ever called blessed.
Possessed of the hypostatic Wisdom of the Father, Who maketh all of you
wise, О disciples of Christ, with the foolishness of your preaching ye made the
world wise and brought it to the knowledge of God.
To the Martyrs: Enduring tortures as though ye were bodiless, О spiritual
athletes of Christ, ye mightily vanquished all the incorporeal foe; wherefore, ye are
rightly called blessed forever, О most lauded ones.
Glory ..., О ye faithful, let us worship the Trinity; the Father, the Son and the
upright Spirit, the indivisible, undivided and co-enthroned Unity; and let us cry
out: Holy, Holy, Holy art Thou, О most adored Trinity!
Now & ever ..., We bless thee, О most pure one, as thou didst foretell, for
thou hast given birth to God in the flesh, whom the choir of the apostles
preached. With them ask for us release from our transgressions, О all-hymned
one.
