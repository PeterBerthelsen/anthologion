MONDAY EVENING: TONE VIII
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of repentance, in Tone VIII:
Spec. Mel.: “O most glorious wonder ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
I have acquired neither compunction, nor a wellspring of tears, nor fervent
confession, nor weeping which washeth me clean, nor humility of heart; I have
been neither an emulator of the publican, nor of the harlot, nor of the prodigal
son. How, therefore, shall I find remission for my many sins? But in the
judgments which Thou knowest, save me, О Christ.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
I have made myself foreign to every commandment of God; in every way I
have neglected higher virtue; I have mindlessly wasted my whole life in
slothfulness; and I have committed every unseemly and iniquitous act in
fornication. Wherefore, since Thou art compassionate О Christ, have pity, and
freely save me.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
In Thine anger rebuke me not who am the work of Thy hands, and who with
my foolish mind have torn myself away from goodness, О Lover of mankind, and
Who in the abyss of Thine ineffable compassion wast for my sake well-pleased to
become like unto me. But through the supplications of Thine Ever-virgin Mother,
О Word, grant me divine conversion, in that Thou art God.
Then the Stichera for the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera for the holy & great Forerunner John, in the same tone & melody:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
О blessed Forerunner John, with love ever return my lowly soul to the Lord,
and by thy sacred mediations quench for me the fire of pleasures, guiding me to
the fulfillment of the precepts of God, and truly cleansing the senses of my heart,
that I may glorify thee.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
О all-praised Forerunner John, thou offspring of a barren woman, pure
orchard of the Master and adornment of mankind, divine preserver of my lowly
soul: By thy prayers and aid grant me readiness to forgive, delivering me from the
wiles of the serpent and his wicked treachery and attacks.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
Wholly delightful and full of divine bliss, О ever-glorious one, thou hast
gladdened all who come to thee with faith, delighting the senses of our souls and
bodies, ever releasing us from infirmities and tribulations, from the assaults of
evil, and soul-corrupting pleasures.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
With faith I hasten to thy protection, О pure Birthgiver of God. Save me from
perils and misfortunes, from the confusion of the passions and the malice of the
demons. For, possessed of an abyss of mercy, thou hast been shown to be a
mediatress of salvation, О Lady who hast given birth to the only merciful, allcompassionate and abundantly kind-hearted God.
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone IV:
Prokeimenon: The Lord will hearken unto me * when I cry unto Him.
Verse: When I called upon Thee, O God of my righteousness, Thou didst
hearken unto me.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone VIII:
The angels unceasingly hymn Thee, the King and Master; and I fall down
before Thee, crying like the publican: Cleanse me, О God, and have mercy upon
me!
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
As thou art immortal, О my soul, let not the waves of life engulf thee, but rise
up, crying out to thy Benefactor: Cleanse me, О God, and save me!
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: О martyrs of the Lord, entreat ye our God, and ask for our
souls a multitude of compassions and the cleansing of our many transgressions,
we beseech you.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Rejoice, thou praise of the universe! * Rejoice, temple of the Lord! * Rejoice,
mountain overshadowed! * Rejoice, refuge of all! * Rejoice, golden candlestick! *
Rejoice, honored glory of the Orthodox! * Rejoice, Mary, Mother of Christ God! *
Rejoice, paradise! Rejoice, divine table! * Rejoice, tabernacle! Rejoice, golden jar!
** Rejoice, thou hope of all!
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

Irmos: O Light never-waning, * why hast Thou turned Thy face from me *
and why hath the alien darkness surrounded me, * wretched though I be? *
But do Thou guide my steps I implore Thee * and turn me back towards
the light of Thy commandments.
By thy birthgiving the bonds of death have been loosed and the might of
corruption bound, О most holy and all-hymned Virgin; wherefore, quickly loose
also the bonds of my transgressions and my heavy grief.
Deliver me from the wickedness of the demons and the malice of men, О
Lady, and quickly heal the sickness of my soul and body, О thou who alone hast
given birth to the Savior and Lord, the Physician of spirits and all flesh.
Glory ..., О most pure one, thee do I implore as the tongs which held the
divine Coal: Utterly consume every passionate lust of thy servant and my grievous
infirmities which are hard to bear, and do thou dry up the torrents of my grief.
Now & ever ..., О all-pure Lady, thy Son hath given thee as salvation for all
who believe in Him and proclaim Him to be God manifestly incarnate from thee;
wherefore, save me from divers misfortunes and tribulations.
ОDE VI

from the abyss of evils I pray Thee, * for unto Thee have I cried, * and
Thou hast hearkened unto me, * O God of my salvation.
Look upon me with thy merciful eye, О Lady, and quickly deliver me from
cruel infirmities, from every affliction and fall which now awaiteth me.

passionate behavior, from unseemly jealousy, from, all evil and the oppression of
life.

human nature from corruption; wherefore, By thy prayers deliver me from the
temptations which beset me, О pure one.

naught can contain, О most pure Lady. By thy prayers show me to be a temple of
His grace, and preserve me unharmed.
Lord, have mercy, (Thrice).
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Sessional hymn, in Tone VIII:
All we, the generations of mankind, * call thee blessed, * in that thou art the
Virgin who alone among women * hast given birth without seed unto God in the
flesh; * for the fire of the Godhead made its abode within thee, * and thou didst
feed the Creator and Lord * with milk as an infant. * Wherefore, we, the race of
mankind and of angels, * glorify thy birthgiving, * and together we cry out to thee:
* Entreat Christ God to grant forgiveness of sins ** unto those who with faith
worship thy most holy Offspring.
ODE VII
Irmos: The Children of Judaea, * who of old came to dwell in Babylon, *
trampled underfoot the flame of the furnace * through their faith in the
Trinity, * as they sang: 'O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou.'
Grievous pangs have I found to be my reward, and, afflicted, I experience the
pain of great illness; yet I entreat thee, О Theotokos: Help me, and quickly grant
me health by thy prayers.
О blessed Virgin, refuge of all the faithful who sorrow, rescue me from all
temptation and grief, and from the malice of those who envy me, and deliver me
from sins and divers ailments.
Glory ..., О jar of beaten gold, from whence the life-creating Myrrh hath
flowed forth upon the faithful: By thine aid, О pure Birthgiver of God, purge my
soul and body of infirmities and the defilement of transgressions.
Now & ever ..., Unceasingly glorifying the Word Who with the Father and the
Spirit is equally without beginning, and Who was ineffably born from thee, О
Mother of God, we chant in praise: О God of our fathers, blessed art Thou!
ODE VIII
Irmos: In his wrath the Chaldean Tyrant made the furnace blaze, * with
heat fanned sevenfold for the servants of God; * but when he perceived that
they had been saved by a greater power * he cried aloud to the Creator and
Redeemer; * ‘ye children bless, ye priests praise, * ye people, supremely
exalt Him throughout all ages’.
All of us who in faith have recourse to thine aid proclaim the magnitude of thy
divers miracles, О Lady. Save me now from cruel infirmity, from pangs of soul
and body, and show me to be healthy, that I may glorify Christ thy Son
throughout the ages.
Of a sudden the winds of those who envy me have blown and the rivers of the
wicked have grievously smitten the house of my mind, О pure Virgin; but repel
the assault of all griefs as it were that of the mindlessly raging sea, and By thy
prayers grant me stillness throughout all ages.

ON TUESDAY MORNING: TONE VIII
AT MATINS
After the 1st chanting of the Psalter,
The Sessional hymns of repentance, in Tone VIII:
Look upon my lowliness with Thy compassionate eye, О Lord, for my life will
reach its end shortly, and there will be no salvation for me because of my works.
Wherefore, I pray: Look upon my lowliness with Thy compassionate eye, О Lord,
and save me!
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.
The Judge is coming! Take care, О my soul, and consider the hour of that
dread day; for He is without mercy for those who have shown no mercy.
Wherefore, before the end cry aloud: Have pity on me, О Savior, Who alone art
sinless!
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O ye faithful, with hymns let us magnify the Theotokos, * the unshakable
confirmation of the Faith * and the precious gift of our souls: * Rejoice, thou who
didst hold within thy womb the Stone of life! * Rejoice, thou hope of the ends of
the earth * and aid of the sorrowful! ** Rejoice, thou Bride unwedded!
After the 2nd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone VIII:
Like the harlot I fall down before Thee, that I may receive remission; and
instead of myrrh I offer Thee tears from the depths of my heart, that Thou mayest
take pity on me as Thou didst her, О Savior, and grant me cleansing of my sins:
For like her I cry to Thee: Deliver me from the mire of my deeds!
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.
My time on earth cometh to an end, my life hath passed by, and Thy dread
judgment-seat is made ready, О Savior; the trial awaiteth me, threatening me with
fiery torment, and unquenchable flame. Grant me a shower of tears and quench
its power, О Thou Who desirest that all men should be saved.
Verse: Wondrous is God in His saints, * the God of Israel.
To the Martyrs: Ye were shown to be noetic beacons, О holy martyrs, for by
faith ye abolished the gloom of delusion, lit the lamps of our souls, and entered
with glory into the heavenly bridal-chamber with the Bridegroom. Pray ye now,
we beseech you, that our souls be saved.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O most pure Virgin Mother of God, heal thou the grievous passions of my
soul, I pray, and grant me forgiveness of the transgressions which I have
committed, defiling my soul and body, wretch that I am. Woe is me! What shall I
do at that hour when the angel will separate my soul from my passion-plagued
body? Then be thou my helper and most fervent intercessor; for thee do I, thy
servant, have as my hope.
After the 3rd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone VIII:
Spec. Mel.: “Pondering what was mystically commanded ...”:
Bringing to mind the day and hour of Thy dread, terrible and implacable
tribunal, О Master Christ, I tremble like a malefactor. Shameful are the deeds and
grievous the acts which I alone have diligently committed. Wherefore, I fall down
before Thee with fear and cry out in pain: Through the supplications of Thy Forerunner save me, О greatly Merciful One!
О my soul who art wasting thy life in negligence, arise now and lift thine eyes
to repentance. Weep bitterly from the depths of thy heart, lest in the life to come
thou lament in vain. Restrain thyself, considering the second coming of the
Master, and before the judgment condemn thyself, that thou mayest then escape
the righteous judgment.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
By the prayers of Thy bodiless ones, O Christ, * and the Forerunner, * of the
disciples, prophets and martyrs, * of all Thy saints and venerable ones, * and of
Thy blessed Mother, * we beseech Thee; grant us to walk in Thy light, * and deem
us worthy to receive Thy Kingdom ** for the sake of Thy compassionate mercy.
ODE I

may walk in Thy righteous footsteps which lead me to the divine resting-place of
eternal beauty.

salvation.

heavenly Manna hath been given to all the faithful!
ODE IV

Irmos: I have heard report of Thee O Lord, * and I was afraid, * for thy
counsel is ineffable, * being the ever-existent God, * Thou didst come forth
from the Virgin, * wherefore I hymn Thee: * glory to thy condescension, O
Christ, * glory to Thy power.
The enemy deceiver beguiled me into sinfully tasting of the fruit, О Good
One, and exiled me far from Thee, and made me prey to his fangs. О only Savior,
hasten Thou to rescue me!

and as Thou art full of tender compassion grant me a purifying time of

transforming the roaring flames into dew. * O God of our fathers, blessed
art Thou.
Conceived and born in iniquities, I have sinned more than all, О

chosen sheep.
ODE VIII
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: O Thou who dost cover Thy chambers on high with the waters, *
Thou Who hast set the sands to bound the sea * and Who upholdest all
things: * the sun doth sing Thy praises, * the moon giveth Thee glory, *
every creature offereth a hymn unto Thee, * as their Fashioner, throughout
the ages.
Thou hast defiled thy hands with all manner of wicked deeds, О my soul. How
canst thou lift them up, and converse with God? And thy feet, which hasten to
shameless deeds, thou hast rendered useless. Take care to walk the paths of
salvation through repentance.
I have never abode in Thy commandments, O good Lord, nor have I done
Thy will for even a single day. What eyes can I raise to Thee Who rendereth just
judgment and shalt send the guilty into the fire of Gehenna?

the Creator; wherefore, ye have inherited a torrent of delight.

and Whom thou didst point out to all, that He slay my passions and save my soul.
Ease thou the burden of my soul and do battle against those who make war
upon me, О Baptist of the Lord; and show me to be unscathed by their malice.
Fleeing, thou didst withdraw and make thine abode in the trackless wilderness,
О prophet; wherefore, I beseech thee: Quickly lay waste to the passions of my
soul.
Theotokion: О Virgin, thou art the vine which gave rise to the ripe Cluster,
and now givest me the drink of compunction, taking away the drunkenness of
mine evils.
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX

Irmos: Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, * Who hath exalted the horn of
salvation on our behalf * in the house of His child David, * wherein the
Dayspring from on high hath visited us, * and guided us on the path of
peace.
О Christ, mercifully regard me, whose shoulders have received many stripes,
and heal them, pouring forth wine and oil upon them, that saved I may magnify
with thanksgiving the understanding of Thy loving-kindness, О Savior.
As Thou didst deliver from murder and evils the good thief who cried out to
Thee, and as Thou didst have compassion upon the harlot who wept, have mercy
upon me, the despairing, О Savior as Thou didst Thy great disciple Peter and
David the prophet.
To the Martyrs: Conforming to the passions of Him Who suffered for our
sake, О passion-bearers, with Him ye now send up glory together, deified by
divine communion, resplendent with rays that outshine the material sun,
enlightening the hearts of the faithful.
To the Martyrs: The virtue of the holy spiritual athletes hath shone forth,
enriching every city with faith, for they possess them as treasures which cannot be
taken away, and which abundantly emit the grace of most glorious miracles. Let us
hymn them as our fervent intercessors.
Theotokion: With the brilliant lightning-flashes of the Son of God Who issued
forth from thy womb, О all-immaculate one, enlighten those who hymn thee with
faith; and by thine intercession rescue us from the darkness devoid of light, and
from everlasting torment.
Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: The prophetic vision of the lawgiver on the mountain, * in the fire of
the burning bush, * prefigured thy birthgiving O Ever-Virgin, * the
salvation of us the faithful, * wherefore with never silent hymns we magnify
thee.
When I must stand before Thy dread throne, О Word, and the penalty for my
deeds will be assessed, what answer shall I give, wretch that I am? For the sake of
Thy Baptist, О Lord my God, have pity on me then.
As the voice of the Word, direct my cries unto God, О most wise Baptist, and
deliver me from the evil of the demons and the temptations of men, that I may
call thee blessed, as is meet.
Nurture me with the immortal food of Christ’s commandments, and give me
the drink of life to consume, О prophet and Forerunner; and present me who flee
under thy protection, to stand before God saved.
Theotokion: О pure and most glorious Virgin Lady, with the Forerunner
entreat thy Son and King, that He save from all need those who with faith call
thee blessed.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone VIII:
When I bring to mind the multitude of the evils I have done, and come to
consider the dread trial, seized with trembling I flee to Thee, the God Who is the
Lover of mankind. Wherefore, disdain me not, I pray Thee, О only Sinless One;
grant compunction to my lowly soul before the end, and save me.
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
Grant me tears as once Thou didst to the sinful woman, О God, and grant that
I may wash the feet which have freed me from the path of delusion, and that I
may offer Thee a pure life wrought for me by repentance, as myrrh of sweet
savor, that even I may hear Thy longed-for voice saying: Thy faith hath saved
thee. Go in peace!
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: Ye struggled greatly, О saints, valiantly enduring tortures at
the hands of the iniquitous; and though ye have passed from this life, ye still work
wonders in this world and heal those made sick by their passions. О holy ones,
pray ye that our souls be saved.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Thy shelter, O Virgin Theotokos, * is spiritual healing; * for, having recourse
unto it, ** we are delivered from spiritual infirmities.
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON TUESDAY MORNING: TONE VIII
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone VIII
Remember us, О Christ, Savior of the world, as Thou didst remember the
thief on the tree; and grant unto all Thy heavenly kingdom, О only
Compassionate One.
As Thou dost possess an abyss of tender compassion, О Christ, dry up the
abyss of my transgressions; and with tears of compunction transform my
hardened soul.
О divine Baptist who of old baptized Christ in water, by thine supplications
impel me to the haven of repentance, for I am tempest-tossed by the threefold
billows of the passions.
To the Martyrs: Having quenched the fire of the madness of idolatry with your
blood, О holy passion-bearers, ye ever pour forth streams of healings, curing
divers passions.
Glory ..., О beginningless Father, Son and divine Spirit, through the
supplications of the Baptist ease the chronic sufferings of my soul, I pray, and
save me, Thy servant.
Now & ever ..., By thy supplications, О most pure Theotokos, from the
disgrace of the passions and cruel torment in Hades deliver us who piously call
thee blessed.
