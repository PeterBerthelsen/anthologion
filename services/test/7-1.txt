TONE SEVEN
ON SATURDAY EVENING
AT LITTLE VESPERS
On "Lord, I have cried ...", 4 Stichera:
The Resurrection Stichera, in Tone VII:
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
O Come, let us rejoice in the Lord * who hath destroyed the dominion of
death * and enlightened the race of mankind, * as we cry aloud with the Bodiless
Powers: ** 'Our Creator and Savior, glory be to Thee!'
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
O Come, let us rejoice in the Lord * who hath destroyed the dominion of
death * and enlightened the race of mankind, * as we cry aloud with the Bodiless
Powers: ** 'Our Creator and Savior, glory be to Thee!'
Verse: O praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
Thou didst endure the Cross and burial * for our sake, O Christ, * but as God
by Thy death Thou hast slain death; * wherefore we worship Thy Resurrection on
the third day. ** O Lord, glory be to Thee!
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
The Apostles were struck with amazement when they saw the Creator’s arising
* and they cried aloud the angelic hymn of praise: * 'This is the glory of the
Church, this is the wealth of the Kingdom. ** O Lord, who hath suffered for us,
glory be to Thee!'
Glory ..., Now & Ever ..., Theotokion; in Tone VII:
Truly fearful and ineffable is the mystery * that hath been wrought in thee, O
Most pure one; * for surpassing nature and telling Thou hast given birth to the
Word, the cause of all things, * Who became incarnate by the holy Spirit, * taking
flesh from thee, while preserving his own nature unchanged. * For when both
natures had come together self-subsistent in a single hypostasis, * He came forth
dual in nature, wholly God and wholly man, * displaying the fullness of both
natures. * For having endured the passion in the flesh on the Cross, * he remained
impassible in his divinity; * and having reposed as a man he returned to life on the
third day as God, * destroying the dominion of death and redeeming the race of
mankind from corruption. * O Mother of God, beseech him as the Redeemer and
Savior of our race ** to send down upon us the great mercy of his compassion.
Then “O Joyous Light ...”:
The Prokeimenon: “The Lord is King ...”, with its verses.
After “Vouchsafe O Lord ...”:
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the Theotokos, in Tone VII:
Thou didst arise from the tomb, * O Savior of the world, * and with Thy flesh
* Thou hast raised mankind. ** O Lord, glory be to Thee!
Verse: I shall commemorate thy name * in every generation and generation.
O Virgin, Thou hast become the Dayspring of the spiritual Sun, * that came
upon the sunset of our nature; * but as Thou hast boldness, * all-praised Mother
of God, ** beseech him to redeem our souls from our countless offences.
Verse: Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear; * and forget
thine own people and thy father’s house.
Like the rod from Jesse’s root, * thou hast been revealed, O Virgin, * as
budding forth with Him, Who wholly uprooted the weeds of deception, * as thou
hast boldness towards Him, pray thou ceaselessly, O all-praised one, * to root out
the passions of my heart, ** and to plant in it the fear of Him and save me.
Verse: The rich among the people * shall entreat thy countenance.
O gate of God most holy, deliver me from the gates of Hades * and show me
also the way of repentance, * by which I may find the gate that leads unto life. * O
Guide of those who have gone astray, ** watch over the race of thy faithful
people and save our souls.
Glory ..., Now & Ever ..., Theotokion:
From thee, all-holy Virgin Theotokos, * Christ our God wast born, * He Who
is truly God before the ages, became a man; * Though God omniscient, He hath
appeared as man for our sakes. * For in Himself He preserveth the properties of
each nature, * causing the one to shine forth with wonders, and confirming the
other by sufferings, * wherefore he dieth as a man and riseth as God. * Implore
him, O pure one who knewest not wedlock, ** that our souls may be saved.
“Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion. Then:
Resurrection Troparion, in Tone I:
Thou didst destroy death by Thy Cross, * Thou didst open paradise to the
thief. * Thou didst change the lamentation of the Myrrh-bearers, * and Thou didst
command Thine Apostles to proclaim * that Thou didst arise, O Christ God, **
granting the world great mercy.
Glory ..., Now & Ever ..., Theotokion:
And the Dismissal.
AT GREAT VESPERS
On “Lord I have cried ...”, 10 Stichera: 7 Resurrection Stichera and 3 of the
Saint of the day, or 4 and 6 if the Menaion service is of Polyeleos rank.
The Resurrection Stichera, in Tone VII:
Verse: Bring my soul out of prison * that I may confess Thy name.
O Come, let us rejoice in the Lord * who hath destroyed the dominion of
death * and enlightened the race of mankind, * as we cry aloud with the Bodiless
Powers: ** 'Our Creator and Savior, glory be to Thee!'
Verse: The righteous shall wait patiently for me * until Thou shalt reward
me.
Thou didst endure the Cross and burial * for our sake, O Christ, * but as God
by Thy death Thou hast slain death; * wherefore we worship Thy Resurrection on
the third day. ** O Lord, glory be to Thee!

my voice.
The Apostles were struck with amazement when they saw the Creator’s arising
* and they cried aloud the angelic hymn of praise: * 'This is the glory of the
Church, this is the wealth of the Kingdom. ** O Lord, who hath suffered for us,
glory be to Thee!'
Other Stichera by Anatolius:
Verse: Let Thine ears be attentive * to the voice of my supplication.
Though Thou wast seized by lawless men, O Christ, * yet Thou art my God,
and I am not ashamed; * Thy back was scourged, but I do not deny Thee; * Thou
wast nailed to a Cross, but I do not hide from Thee. * I make my boast in Thine
Arising; * for Thy death is my life. ** All-powerful Lord who lovest mankind,
glory be to Thee!
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, O Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
Fulfilling David’s prophecy Christ revealed his majesty * to his Disciples in
Zion, * showing that he was praised and ever glorified with the Father and the
Holy Spirit; * at first without flesh as the Word. * afterwards for our sake
incarnate and put to death as a man, * and risen with authority ** as the Lover of
mankind.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, O Lord; my
soul hath patiently waited for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
By willingly descending into Hades O Christ, * Thou didst despoil death, * and
by arising on the third day as God and Lord, * Thou didst raise together with
Thyself from the bonds and corruption of Hades, * those who cried aloud: 'Glory
to Thine all-powerful Resurrection. ** O Lord, glory be to Thee!'
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
Thou wast laid in a tomb, O Lord, as one who sleepeth * and who hast arisen
on the third day as one mighty in strength, * raising with thyself Adam from the
corruption of death, ** as One All-powerful.
Then the Stichera from the Menaion, with the following Verses:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
Verse: O praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
Glory from the Menaion, if appointed. Otherwise:
Glory ..., Now & Ever ..., Theotokion Dogmatic:
Thou hast been known to have become a Mother * in a manner surpassing
nature O Theotokos, * and hast remained a Virgin in a manner beyond all telling
and understanding; * no tongue can expound the wonder of thy birthgiving. * For
while thy conceiving O Pure one, was most glorious, * the manner of thy
birthgiving transcends comprehension; * for where God so willeth, the order of
nature is overthrown. * Wherefore, we all, knowing thee to be the Mother of
God, * do earnestly entreat thee: ** Pray thou that our souls be saved!
After the Entrance and “O Joyous Light ...”,

On the Aposticha, these Stichera, in Tone VII:
Thou didst arise from the tomb, O Savior of the world, * and with Thy flesh
Thou hast raised mankind. ** O Lord, glory be to Thee!
Verse: The Lord is King: He is clothed with majesty. * The Lord is clothed
with strength and He hath girt Himself..
Come, let us worship Him Who hath arisen from the dead * and enlightened
all things; * for he hath delivered us from the tyranny of Hades * through his
Resurrection on the third day, * granting us life and great mercy.
Verse: For He established the universe * which shall not be shaken.
Having descended into Hades O Christ, Thou hast despoiled death, * and by
rising on the third day, Thou hast raised us also together with Thyself, * wherefore
we glorify Thine all-powerful Arising. ** O Lord, glory be to Thee!
Verse: Holiness becometh Thy house, O Lord, * unto length of days.
Fearful didst Thou appear, O Lord, as Thou lay in the tomb as One sleeping; *
and having arisen on the third day as All-powerful * Thou hast raised Adam
together with Thyself, who cried aloud: ** 'Glory to Thy Resurrection, O only
Lover of mankind.'
Glory from the Menaion, if appointed, otherwise:
Glory ..., Now & Ever ..., Theotokion:
Having recourse unto thy protection, O Lady, * all we born of earth cry aloud
to thee: * O Theotokos, our hope, deliver us * from our countless transgressions,
** and save thou our souls.
“Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion. Then:
Tone IV:
O Theotokos and Virgin, rejoice, * O Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with
thee; * blessed art thou among women, * and blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, **
for thou hast borne the Savior of our souls. (Thrice)

thief. * Thou didst change the lamentation of the Myrrh-bearers, * and Thou didst
command Thine Apostles to proclaim * that Thou didst arise, O Christ God, **
granting the world great mercy.
Resurrection Theotokion; in Tone VII:
As thou art the treasury of our resurrection, * O all-hymned one, * lead up
from the pit and abyss of transgression * those who place their trust in thee, * for
thou who hast given birth to our Salvation * hast saved those who are subject to
sin. * Thou wast a Virgin before giving birth, * and a virgin during child-bearing,
** and thou didst remain a Virgin ** even after birthgiving.

hath been glorified.
In song we offer unto thee as an adornment, gifts of thanksgiving and the

shown to be the Mother of God.
ODE III
Irmos: O Lord and Savior, * Who in the beginning established the heavens
* by Thine all-powerful Word, * and by the divine and all-accomplishing
Spirit * hath granted them all their strength, * do Thou establish me on the
unshakeable rock of Thy confession.
Let us earnestly offer cries of thanksgiving, honoring as our intercessor her
who is the magnitude of divine joy and our gladness from the beginning.
Delivered by thee from misfortunes, and having received joy because of thee,
О Mother unwedded, we all glorify thee as a good bestower of gifts and a
praiseworthy helper.

prayer, О Mother of Christ God, with cries of thanksgiving we faithfully hymn

the bestowal of life everlasting.

Virgin, playing divine songs, having been delivered from great grief.

do thou deliver us by thy divine protection, О pure one.
Now & ever ..., Truly blessed are those who honor thee, О most pure
Theotokos, for through thee we have been delivered from sin and grief.
ODE V
Irmos: Night is bereft of light * for those without faith, О Christ, * but for
the faithful there is enlightenment * in the sweetness of Thy words; *
wherefore, I rise early unto Thee * and hymn Thy Divinity.
О Virgin, thou hast given birth to Christ, the Destroyer of sin, by Whom the
world hath been saved from perils and pain; wherefore, we who have been
delivered from grief cry aloud unto thee: Rejoice!
Beset by divers perils, by grief and sorrow and adverse circumstances, О pure
Lady, we who were bereft of gladness have found thee to be our hope.
Glory ..., As the preservation of salvation for us, thy servants, О pure one,
thou dispellest dangers, keeping us unharmed; wherefore, we who have shared in
thy manifold good things give thanks to thee with hymns.
Now & ever ..., Delivered by thee from many sins, from sickness and pain, and
from grievous illness, О most pure Lady, we give thanks unto thee; for thou art
the sure hope of thy faithful servants.
ODE VI
Irmos: Having fallen into the abyss of sin, О Good One, * like Jonah from
the midst of the whale I cry unto Thee: * Lead my life up from corruption,
* and save me, О Lover of mankind.
Even the tongues of the angels are unable to fittingly sing thy praises, О pure
one; but, acting now as servants, we offer thee the salutation of Gabriel.
Having fallen into the abyss of grief and evil circumstances because of our
sins, we are delivered by thee from want and danger, О pure Virgin Theotokos.
Glory ..., О pure one, the whole world is under debt to thank, praise and
glorify thy grace with piety; for through thee we have been delivered from

faith flee beneath thy protection, О most pure Virgin.
Lord, have mercy, (Thrice).
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Sessional hymn, in Tone VII:
О Lord, we are Thy people and the sheep of Thy pasture. Like a shepherd
return us who have strayed, and gather us together who have been scattered by
corruption. Have mercy upon Thy flock and take pity upon Thy people, through
the prayers of the Theotokos, О Thou Who alone art sinless.
ODE VII
Irmos: Cast into the fiery furnace, * the venerable children transformed the
fire into dew, * crying aloud thus in hymnody: * Blessed art Thou O Lord,
the God of our fathers!
We offer thee the joy of thanksgiving, О Mother of God, for, truly delivered
by thee from every evil power, we cry out to thee together: Blessed art thou!
We have come to dwell in the gloom of evening, in the tears of lamentation, in
the expectation of evils; yet, deified by thy godly protection, О Virgin, we have
found the joy of the morning: for thou hast saved us.
Glory ..., Having acquired thy protection before God as a divine refuge amid
perils, persecutions and sins, О most pure one, we all flee to thee, and through
thee obtain release.
Now & ever ..., With mouth and spirit we proclaim the grace of thy prayer, О
pure and glorious one; for because of thee we are all delivered from danger and
tempest, from grievous sorrows and the sin of the passions.
ODE VIII
Irmos: Unto Him before whom the cherubim are in awe, * and the
seraphim filled with wonder, * the Fashioner of the world: * O ye priests
and servants and spirits of the righteous, * hymn ye, bless ye, and
supremely exalt * throughout the ages.
As one delivered By thy prayers from the tempest of sin, from passions and
perils, О good Theotokos, with a voice of thanksgiving we cry aloud unto thee:
“Rejoice!”; for through thee have we passed from grief to joy.
О good one, disdain not those who are beset by sickness and danger; but,
hearkening unto our poor supplication, free us from great sorrows, that we may
hymn thine intercession with faith, О pure one.
Glory ..., О thou who hast caused our transgressions to be wiped away, raise
us up now from griefs and perils, from human passions and unseemly
temptations; and by thy divine supplications, О Theotokos, most gloriously

manner transcending nature became a mother, * and is a Virgin by nature,
* she alone is blessed among women!

For Thine is the kingdom ..., And we say: Amen. Lord, have mercy (12 times),
Glory..., Now & ever..., О come, let us worship (Thrice). Psalm 50 (Have mercy
on me, О God...)
And then, the Canon to the Holy & Life-creating Trinity, the acrostic whereof
is “I praise Thee, О Trinity, Thou sole reigning Essence”, the composition of
Metrophanes, in Tone VII:
ODE I
Irmos: At thy command O Lord, * the nature of the waters that beforehand
flowed freely was transformed * and became like the earth; * whereby Israel
having traversed them dryshod * chanted unto Thee a hymn of victory.
Refrain: О most holy Trinity, our God, glory be to Thee!
The noetic mouth of my heart and my material lips do Thou open that I may
praise Thee, О only thrice-radiant God of all, and that I may chant hymnody of
thanksgiving unto Thee, the Bestower of light.
That Thou mightest show forth the abundance of Thy goodness, Thou didst
create man, who is the mere image in clay of Thy ruling image, О Creator, Trinity
infinite in power.
О beginningless Mind, Who didst beget the coeternal Word and shine forth
the equally-beginningless Spirit: Grant that we may worship the one God in three
Hypostases, alike in essence.
Theotokion: О Word of God, Thou didst appear to Moses in the bush as a
purifying fire which in no wise consumed it, prefiguring Thine incarnation from
the Virgin, whereby Thou didst refashion mankind.
ODE III
Irmos: O Lord and Savior, * Who in the beginning established the heavens
* by Thine all-powerful Word , * and by the divine and all-accomplishing
Spirit * hath granted them all their strength, * do Thou establish me on the
unshakeable rock of Thy confession.
Hymning Thee, the one, thrice-radiant and all-accomplishing Master, О God
infinite in power, we beg deliverance from sins and temptations. Disdain not
those who with faith glorify Thy goodness.
God the Word appeared from the Father as doth an offshoot from a
beginningless root, and He is equal in might with the conjoined and divine Spirit;
wherefore, О ye faithful, let us glorify the Trinity of Hypostases, the one
Dominion.
О ye faithful, let us all glorify the one reigning Trinity, the Essence in three
Hypostases, indivisibly and indistinguishably equal in glory and conjoined; and
rendering worship, let us ask forgiveness offenses.
Theotokion: О Word of God, having immutably taken on the likeness of man,
Thou didst manifestly issue forth from the pure Maiden, and didst show unto all
the thrice-radiant Godhead of the immutable Hypostases one in essence.
Lord, have mercy! (Thrice)
Sessional hymns, in Tone VII:
Spec. Mel.: “He Who for my sake ...”:
Have mercy on Thy servants who have sinned, О Holy Trinity; accept those
who repent before Thee, О Compassionate One, and grant unto them
forgiveness.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Bless thou our souls, which are afflicted by sins, О all-pure Theotokos, and
from transgressions deliver those who hymn thee, О Bride of God.
ODE IV
Irmos: Having never left the bosom of the Father, * Thou didst descend to
earth O Christ God, * I have heard of the mystery of Thy dispensation, *
and I have glorified Thee, * O only Lover of mankind.
О sustaining and thrice-radiant Unity, divine and salvific for all, protect now
those who hymn Thee, and save them from tribulation, sufferings and every
affliction.
Perplexed by the sayings which signify Thine unapproachable and thriceradiant Divinity, we hymn Thee, О Lord Who lovest mankind, and glorify Thy
power.
With the incorporeal choirs in the heavens, we on earth distinguish between
Thy Hypostases, О Unity and Trinity, and with love we glorify Thee as He Who
alone hath dominion over all.
Theotokion: Without leaving the glory of the Father, of Thine own will Thou
didst condescend to assume our lowliness, becoming incarnate, О Transcendent
One; and Thou didst raise it up to divine glory, in that Thou art full of lovingkindness.
ODE V
Irmos: Night is bereft of light * for those without faith, О Christ, * but for
the faithful there is enlightenment * in the sweetness of Thy words; *
wherefore, I rise early unto Thee * and hymn Thy Divinity.
О Trinity of Hypostases, light-creating Essence, Unity in counsel, glory and
worship: Establish us in Thy love. (Twice)
Glorifying the Mind, the Word and the Spirit, the divine, Three-Sunned
Essence, we beg deliverance from temptations and all tribulations.
Theotokion: Taking form in human nature through the holy Virgin, О Word
of God, Thou didst teach all to hymn the Trinity in Unity, sharing the same form
and co-enthroned.
ODE VI
Irmos: Sailing in the tempest of the cares of life, * together with the ship I
have been submerged by sins, * and cast to the soul-corrupting beast, *
wherefore like Jonah I cry to Thee, O Christ: * Lead me up from the deadly
abyss.
We glorify the Dominion one in glory, the sole reigning Godhead in three
Hypostases which are immutably joined One with Another, distinguished only as
to the origin of Each. (Twice)
The noetic ranks of the beauties of the angels praise Thee, О Three-Sunned
Godhead; and with mouths of clay we also faithfully hymn and glorify Thee as the
one Creator of all.
Theotokion: At the strange words of the archangel the Word Who was
begotten before the ages as another Sun, of the Father Who is the Sun, shone
forth from the Virgin in the latter times, and preached the incomprehensible God
Who is One in three Hypostases.
Lord, have mercy! (Thrice)
Sessional hymns, in Tone VII:
Spec. Mel.: “Brighter than fire ...”:
О consubstantial Trinity, Unity of all in three Hypostases, have mercy upon
those Whom Thou hast created, О Immortal One, burning up the evils of
transgressors and enlightening the hearts of those who sing to Thy lovingkindness: О our God, glory be to Thee!
Glory..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
More brilliant than light is the mercy of thy grace, О Lady, burning up the sins
of all and bedewing the thoughts of those who praise thy mighty works, О most
immaculate Theotokos.
ODE VII
Irmos: Cast into the fiery furnace, * the venerable children transformed the
fire into dew, * crying aloud thus in hymnody: * Blessed art Thou O Lord,
the God of our fathers!
О Thrice-radiant God, unapproachable and transcendent Unity, ever shining
with the splendors of rays of light, save those who piously believe on Thee and
worship Thee, О Master.
Following the sayings of the divine prophets, Thee only, the one God of all in
three Hypostases, do we glorify, crying out thus: Blessed art Thou, О Lord God
of our fathers!
With lips of dust, О Holy Trinity, we, together with the immaterial ranks,
hymn Thee with songs crying out to the Unity of Essence: Blessed art Thou, О
Lord God of our fathers!
Theotokion: That He Who fashioned Adam might fashion him anew, He
clearly became incarnate from thee, О all-pure one, deifying mankind, which
crieth out thus: Blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, О most pure one!
ODE VIII
Irmos: Unconsumed by fire, the bush on Sinai spake unto Moses, * slow of
speech and stammering, * and revealed God unto him; * and zeal for God
showed forth the three Children who chanted hymns * to be unvanquished
by the fire. * O all ye His works, praise ye the Lord * and supremely exalt
Him throughout all ages.
Grant that those who hymn Thee may be enlightened with the illuminating
rays of the thrice-radiant Sun, and may now behold Thy beauty, О Trinity and
Unity. And grant this ever, as far as is possible, unto all who with fitting faith
hymn Thy greatness throughout all ages.
Thou dost hold all things, О beginningless Dominion in Trinity and Unity,
and dost direct heaven and the earth. Wherefore, keep me ever drawn by Thy
love, that I may chant unto Thee: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and
supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!
Make me a temple of Thy thrice-radiant effulgence, О Benefactor and Lover
of mankind, and show me to be immune to communion and fellowship with the
invisible foe and the carnal passions, О my God, sole Ruler and Lord of glory,
that I may hymn Thee throughout all ages.
Theotokion: The divine Light Who shone forth from thy womb, О most pure
Mother of God, hath illumined the whole world with the light of the threefold
Sun, and shown the earth to be another heaven, which singeth: Hymn the Lord,
all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!
ODE IX
Irmos: O Mother of God and Virgin, * thou hast given birth and yet
remained a virgin, * not in accordance with nature, * but by the
condescension of God|* but by the condescension of God; * wherefore, we
ever magnify thee, * who alone wast deemed worthy * of the wonders of
God.
We who are clay are unable to worthily hymn Thee with exalted speech,
Whom the seraphim unceasingly hymn in the highest; yet we dare to magnify
Thee as the Master of all Who art full of love for mankind.
Deliver those who hymn Thee from illness of body and the passions of the
soul, О Trinity one and indivisible; and grant that we may be preserved unharmed
by all the trials of life.
О dominion equal in power, divine, thrice-radiant and omnipotent, immutable
Beauty of essential goodness: Grant remission of transgressions unto Thy
servants, and deliver us from temptations and sufferings.
Theotokion: Receiving mind and soul and fleshly substance from thy most
pure womb, О Theotokos, God the Word truly became a man; and He manifestly
showed mankind to share in the divine nature.
Then, the hymn of Gregory the Sinaite:
(which is chanted every Sunday after the canon)
It is truly meet to glorify Thee, the Word of God, before Whom the cherubim
tremble and quake, and Whom the hosts of heaven glorify. And with fear we
glorify Christ, the Bestower of life, Who rose from the tomb on the third day.
With divine songs let us all in godly manner hymn the Father, the Son and the
Spirit divine, the Might in three Hypostases, the one King- ship and Dominion,
Whom all mortals hymn and the hosts of heaven glorify, the essential Unity in
three Hypostases, Who is worshipped with faith by all.
We magnify Thee, the Godhead, the Lord of the cherubim, the incomparable
divine Origin of the seraphim, the indivisible Trinity in Unity.
I worship the beginningless God the Father, the Son Who is equally without
beginning, and the Spirit. With hymns let us honor the one indivisible and unified
Essence, the threefold Unity.
Shine forth Thy dazzling lightning flashes upon me, О my God in three
Hypostases, Thou Creator of all, and show me to be a splendid, luminous and
immutable habitation of Thine unapproachable glory.
With fear let us glorify Christ the Bestower of life, Who became ineffably
incarnate of the Virgin, for the cherubim tremble and quake before Him, and the
angelic armies glorify Him.
The rest of Nocturnes, and the dismissal.
SUNDAY MORNING: TONE VII
AT MATINS
At "God is The Lord ...," the Resurrection Troparion, in Tone VII:
Thou didst destroy death by Thy Cross, * Thou didst open paradise to the
thief. * Thou didst change the lamentation of the Myrrh-bearers, * and Thou didst

out to Thee O Word, ‘Who chose me as Thine own bride from among the
unbelieving nations.’ by the prayers of her who gave birth to Thee grant salvation
to the faithful, for thou art compassionate and lovest mankind.
Another, of the Theotokos:

Ever-virgin maiden, for our sake thou wast revealed to be the cause of eternal
joy and gladness, having carried in thy womb the Redeemer, who delivereth those
who in truth and by the inspiration of the divine Spirit honor Him as God.

Most pure one, who didst contain in a manner surpassing nature, God seated in
the bosom of the Father, Whom without ceasing we the faithful magnify.
Refrain: Most holy Theotokos save us.
Thou art truly higher than all creation, O Maiden; since for our sake thou hast
given birth in the flesh to the Creator of all things; therefore, as Mother of the
only Master, thou hast majestically brought about victory for us against all
adversaries.
The Troparia from the Menaion, then the appointed Katavasia.
The small litany:
Then, “Holy is our God ...”: (Thrice)
Exapostilarion (Svetilen).
Note: The Exapostilarion is taken from the prescribed Eothinon according to
the Resurrection Gospel, however, If the Menaion service is ‘feasted’ the
Exapostilarion, with the appointed Theotokion, are taken from the Menaion.
On the Aposticha: “Let every breath ...”, 8 Stichera of the Resurrection,
however, if the service from the Menaion is ‘feasted’ sing the first 4 Stichera from
the Resurrection, and the last 4 from the Menaion, with the appointed verses.
Resurrection Stichera, in Tone VII:
Verse: To do among them the judgment that is written * This glory shall be
to all His saints.
Christ is risen from the dead, loosing the bonds of death; * O earth! proclaim
the good tidings of great joy; ** and ye heavens praise the glory of God.
Verse: Praise ye God in His saints, * praise Him in the firmament of His
power.
Having seen the Resurrection of Christ, * let us worship the holy Lord Jesus,
** the only sinless one.
Verse: Praise Him for His mighty acts, * praise Him according to the
multitude of His greatness.
We cease not to worship the Holy Resurrection of Christ, * for He hath saved
us from our iniquities, ** Holy is the Lord Jesus who hath shown us the
Resurrection.
Verse: Praise Him with the sound of trumpet, * praise Him with the
psaltery and harp.
What shall we render unto the Lord for all that He hath rendered unto us? *
For our sake God dwelt among us; * for our corrupted nature the Word became
flesh and dwelt within us; * unto the ungrateful He is the Benefactor; * unto
prisoners He is the Liberator; * unto those in darkness He is the Sun of justice; *
the path unto the Cross; * the Light unto Hades; Life unto death; * Resurrection
for the fallen: * to Him we cry aloud: ** 'Our God, glory be to Thee!'
Others, by Anatolius:
Verse: Praise Him with timbrel and dance, * praise him with strings and
flute.
By Thy mighty power, O Lord, * Thou hast destroyed the gates of Hades and
abolished the dominion of death; * raising with Thyself the dead who slept therein
from eternity in darkness, * by Thy divine and glorious Resurrection, ** as King
of the universe and as God All-powerful.
Verse: Praise Him with tuneful cymbals, praise Him with cymbals of
jubilation. * Let every breath praise the Lord.
Come, let us rejoice in the Lord * and be glad in His Resurrection; * for He
hath raised the dead with Himself * from the indestructible bonds of Hades, **
and as God hath bestowed upon the world eternal life and great mercy.
Verse: Arise, O Lord my God, let Thy hands be lifted high; * forget not
Thy paupers to the end.
A radiant Angel sat on the stone of the grave that held Life, * and announced
the good tidings to the Myrrh-bearing women saying: * 'The Lord is risen, as He
foretold to you; * announce to His Disciples that He goeth before you into
Galilee; ** while to the world He granteth eternal life and great mercy.'
Verse: I will confess Thee, O Lord, with my whole heart, * I will tell of all
Thy wonders.
O ye exceedingly wicked Jews, why did you reject the Cornerstone? * This is
the stone which God hath placed in Zion, * God Who in the wilderness made
water spring forth from the rock, * and for us poured forth immortality from His
side; * this is the stone which was hewn from the Virginal mountain, by the will of
the Son of man, * who cometh again on the clouds of heaven * before the
Ancient of days, as Daniel hath said, ** and His Kingdom is everlasting.
Glory ..., The Eothinon of the Resurrection Gospel
Note: If the service from the Menaion is "feasted" the Eothinon is taken from
the Menaion, and the Eothinon of the Gospel is read at the end of Matins.
Now & Ever ..., Theotokion; in Tone II:
Thou art most blessed, O Virgin Theotokos, * for through Him who took
flesh from thee, Hades hath been captured, * Adam recalled, the curse slain, Eve
set free, * death put to death, and we have been given life. * Therefore in praise
we cry: ** Blessed art Thou, O Christ our God, who hast been thus well-pleased,
glory be to Thee.
Then the Great Doxology and after it the Resurrection Troparion.
Today is salvation come unto the world; * let us sing praises to Him that arose
from the tomb, * and is the Author of our life. * For, having destroyed death by
death, ** He hath given us the victory and great mercy.
