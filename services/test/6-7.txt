On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of the Saints, in Tone VI:
Spec. Mel.: “Having set aside ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
Walking in the footsteps of the sufferings of Christ, the whole company of the
martyrs mightily went forth to many struggles. They confessed Him as God
before ungodly tyrants and iniquitous kings, and endured many tortures, in the
hope of receiving heavenly honors. These they now behold, rejoicing, and
standing before the Lord with the choirs of all the incorporeal hosts.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
О all-sacred shepherds, ye were emulators of the Christ, the Chief Shepherd,
and preserved utterly unharmed the divinely chosen flock, the divine treasures of
piety, driving away the wild wolves, and bringing them into the fold of heaven. As
ye make your abode there, remember those who praise you with love, and pray ye
with boldness unto Christ on behalf of our souls.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
О all ye venerable fathers, who living in holiness, vanquished the demons; and
extinguishing the torments of conscience, valiantly endured the burning of the
passions, О blessed ones, and ye rejoice now with the heavenly hosts of
incorporeal beings; for in the flesh ye emulated their life. With them entreat
Christ, the supremely good God, that we who honor you may find deliverance
from our falls.
Then the Stichera for the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera of the martyrs, in the same tone & melody:

redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.

commandments; by their intercessions have mercy upon us.

the Lord abideth forever.

endured many torments. By their prayers and intercessions, О Lord, preserve us
all.

Who doth not call thee blessed, O most holy Virgin? * Who will not hymn thy
most pure birthgiving? * For the only-begotten Son Who hath shone forth
timelessly from the Father, * came forth, ineffably incarnate, from thee, O pure
one; * By nature he is God, by nature for our sakes, he hath become a man * not
divided into two Hypostases, * but known in two natures without commingling. *
Him do thou beseech, O pure and most blessed one, ** that our souls find mercy!
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone :
Prokeimenon: O God, my helper art Thou, * and Thy mercy shall go
before me.
Verse: Rescue me from mine enemies, O God, and from them that rise up
against me redeem me.

multitude of torments, and have received perfect crowns in the heavens, may they
ever intercede on behalf of our souls.
Verse: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, О
Lord.
To the Martyrs: Thy Cross O Lord, was the invincible weapon of the martyrs.
They beheld impending death before them; but, foreseeing the life that is to come,
they became strengthened with hope in Thee. By their intercessions have mercy
on us.
Verse: Their souls * shall dwell among good things.
For the reposed: Thy command was to me my beginning and foundation. For
desiring to fashion me into a living creature from natures visible and invisible:
Thou didst form my body from the earth, and given me a soul by Thy divine and
quickening breath. Wherefore, O Christ, grant rest to Thy servants in the land of
the living, in the habitations of the righteous.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
By the prayers of her that gaveth birth to Thee O Christ,* and of Thy martyrs

God, whom I will glorify, * the God of my fathers, * and I will exalt Him *
for gloriously hath He been glorified.
Reject me not, О good one, neither abominate nor despise me who with
fervor hasten beneath thy tender compassion, О pure one, but grant that I may
share in the grace which resides in thee.
O good Theotokos, helper of the sorrowful, accept the sighing which issueth
forth from my soul, and deliver me from all the shameless evils I have grievously
committed.
Glory ..., Before thee do I fall down, О good one, thou intercessor for the
troubled. From everlasting fire, from darkness and the abyss deliver me who have
lived my whole life in evil.
Now & ever ..., Woe is me! How can I who have immeasurably sinned before
entreat Thee, О my Jesus? Yet I offer Thee as a mediatress the pure one who gave
birth to Thee. Have mercy and save me!
ODE III
Irmos: O Lord, upon the rock * of Thy commandments * make firm my
heart, * for Thou alone art Holy and Lord.
I fall down before thee, О Mother of the Word. In thy compassion accept

granting me the divine sobriety of repentance and saving conversion.
Now & ever ..., О Birthgiver of God, who ineffably gave birth to the Lord and
Creator of all things, entreat Him to save thy flock.
ODE IV
Irmos: The prophet heard * of Thy coming, O Lord, * and he was afraid. *
How wast Thou to be born of a virgin * and appear unto mankind? * and
he said * "I have heard report of Thee and I am afraid"; * glory to Thy
power, O Lord.
Constantly picking at the sores brought upon my soul by the love of
sensuality, and in pain from the stripes they cause me, I lie lacking feeling and
unhealed. О Birthgiver of God, have mercy and heal me, and save me By thy
prayers.
The darkness of sin hath covered my soul, О Birthgiver of God, such that I go
about in the light as though it were night, not knowing the commandments of
Christ. О thou who hast given birth to the divine Light, have mercy upon me and
enlighten me, I pray.
Glory ..., The Word of the living God descended into thy womb, О Virgin
Mother and, receiving my substance through thy most pure blood, He came forth
in two natures, but a single hypostasis. Him do thou beseech, that He save our
souls.
Now & ever ..., I have assiduously gone through the desires of the body and all
pleasures, and have thereby become wholly corrupt, vile and abominable. О most
pure Birthgiver of God, have mercy, and save me in thy tender compassion.

Irmos: Out of the night I seek Thee early, * enlighten me I pray Thee, O
Lover of mankind, * and guide me in Thy commandments, * and teach me,

cease committing exceedingly wicked deeds, О most pure one, and I offend thee.

thy blood - perfect man and true God - that we be delivered from everlasting fire.
Now & ever ..., О impassable gate, open unto me the portals of true
repentance, I pray, and show me the path of penitence, О pure one, thou guide of
all.
ODE VI
Irmos: With my whole heart, I cried * unto the tenderly compassionate
God, * and he heard me * from the lowest depths of Hades; * and raised
my life up from corruption.
Waves of shameful thoughts now engulf me; yet do thou guide me to the calm
harbor of true repentance by thy tender compassion, О Lady.
Having acquired thee as our hope and unassailable rampart, our steadfast
intercessor, О Maiden, we are delivered from transgressions and grievous
passions, and from all harm.
Glory ..., О pure Virgin Theotokos, I fall down before thee and cry out in
lamentation: Deliver my wretched soul from the judgment which is to come, and
from everlasting fire.

faint of soul, О most pure one; wherefore, disdain me not, but heal me who am
sick of soul.
Lord, have mercy, (Thrice).
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Sessional hymn, in Tone VI:
In the loving-kindness of Thy compassions Thou didst come down to earth,
О Christ, and became incarnate from the Virgin, sanctifying all on earth and
calling them to heaven; wherefore, trusting in Thee, we no longer sin, but are
freed from cares by Thee: for Thou art our Savior, Creator and God.
ODE VII
Irmos: We have sinned, we have transgressed, * and we have done evil
before Thee. * We have not kept nor followed * Thy commandments, but
reject us not utterly, * O God of our fathers.
When mine accursed soul will have to endure separation from my body, there
will be no one to deliver or comfort it; do thou then stand forth, О Lady, and
deliver me from the oppression of the demons.
I fall down before thee and offer thee fervent tears. I know thy love for
mankind, I know thy long-suffering and guilelessness: have mercy upon me now,
О pure one; forgive me and save me.
Glory ..., О Virgin, have mercy on my wretched soul which is beset by the
passions. Look upon the tumult of my passions, look upon the inconstant burning
of my flesh, and grant me thy saving help and salvation.
Now & ever ..., The Son and Word, Who is consubstantial and cobeginningless with the Father, received from thee flesh like thine, though
immutably noetic and animate in a way He Himself knoweth; and therein He hath
refashioned our nature into something higher, О pure Virgin,
ODE VIII
Irmos: Him whom the hosts of heaven glorify, * and before whom tremble
the Cherubim and Seraphim, * let every breath and all creation * praise,
bless, and supremely exalt, * throughout all ages.
I am at a loss when I consider my acts, and I tremble before the dread tribunal
of the Judge. What answer shall I give at that time, wretch that I am? О Sovereign
Lady of the world, be thou my helper.
Turn not thy face away from me, О Lady, when I gaze upon thine image, but
be merciful unto me, and avert from me the sentence which will be pronounced.
Glory ..., О Mary, thou unwedded Bride of God, deliver me thy servant, from
all the harm of the wicked one, I cry to thee, and at the coming trial stand before
me as an advocate, О thou who alone art the intercessor for Christians.
Now & ever ..., That He might deify mankind, О Lady, thy Son revealed
Himself to be a perfect man through thee; wherefore, beseech Him, that He show
me forth as wholly purified, and a partaker in His divine kingdom.
ОDE IX
Irmos: О Virgin who received the angel’s salutation * and hast given birth
to thine own Creator, * save those who magnify thee.
Thou alone art the intercessor for all mankind, О most pure one; thou art the
bulwark of Christians, О pure one. Thee do I now set before Christ as a mediator
for me, the lowly one, that By thy prayers He may have mercy on me, wretched as
I am.
I have committed deeds of the night, and the night of tortures should rightly
now cover me, the vain one, and the retribution of hell should receive me; but as
thou hast given birth to God the Judge, О pure Virgin, deliver me from all
torment.
Glory ..., I have wasted the time of my life in evils, I have drawn nigh unto the
gates of Hades, but in nowise desire to enter therein. Help me, О good
Theotokos, for I have placed my hope in thee.
Now & ever ..., О right loving Lady, adornment of the angels and glory of the
martyrs, with them pray that we find mercy and remission of our debts, and help
us all to finish well the race of our life in the doing of good.

Glory ..., As Thou art good and full of tender compassion by nature, the Willer
of mercies and the Abyss of compassion, those of this place of affliction and the
shadow of death hast Thou taken away. Cause them to dwell where Thy light
shineth, О Savior.
Now & ever ..., О pure one, we know thee to be the holy tabernacle, the ark,
the tablets, the law and grace; in that for thy sake remission hath been given to
those who have been justified by the blood of Him Who became incarnate from
thy womb, О all-immaculate one.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Praises, these Stichera of the martyrs, in Tone V:
Verse: Praise Him for His mighty acts, * praise Him according to the
multitude of His greatness.
To the Martyrs: At the commemoration of Thy saints, O Lord, all creation
celebrateth; the heavens rejoice with the angels, and the earth with all mankind
keepeth festival. By their intercessions have mercy upon us.
Verse: Praise Him with the sound of trumpet, * praise Him with the
psaltery and harp.
O Lord, if we had not had Thy saints as intercessors, and Thy goodness being
merciful to us, how should we have dared, O Savior, to hymn Thee, Whom angels
do unceasingly glorify? O Thou that knowest the hearts of men, spare our souls.
Verse: Praise Him with timbrel and dance, * praise him with strings and
flute.
The memorial of the martyrs is a joy to those who fear the Lord. For having
suffered for Christ’s sake, they received from Him crowns of victory; and now
they intercede with boldness on behalf of our souls.
Verse: Praise Him with tuneful cymbals, praise Him with cymbals of
jubilation. * Let every breath praise the Lord.
Our God hath made wondrous His chosen saints. Rejoice and be glad, all ye
His servants, for crowns and His kingdom have been prepared for you! We
beseech you: Forget us not!
For the reposed: Of old, the eating of the tree in Eden sickened Adam when
the serpent spewed forth its venom; for from this universal death hath arisen,
devouring man. But the Master came, and cast down the serpent, granting us
resurrection. Unto Him, therefore, let us now cry aloud: Have pity on those
whom Thou hast taken to Thyself, О Savior, and, as Thou art the Lover of
mankind, grant them rest with the saints.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Theotokion: We have come to know God Who was incarnate of thee, O
Virgin Theotokos. Him do thou entreat that our souls be saved. 
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the departed, in Tone VI:
Spec. Mel.: “Having set aside ...”:
О greatly merciful Master, Who hast unapproachable loving-kindness for us
and an inexhaustible well-spring of divine goodness. Grant rest in the land of the
living to those who have departed unto Thee, that they forever abide in Thy
dwelling-place, which they so longed so for. For Thou, O Christ, hast shed Thy
blood for all, and hast redeemed the world with Thy life.
Verse: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, O
Lord.
Thou didst willingly endure a life-creating death; pouring forth life upon the
faithful, and granting them eternal joy. Do Thou establish in this joy those who
have fallen asleep in the hope of the Resurrection, and in Thy mercy forgive them
all their offences, for Thou alone art sinless, Thou alone art good and the Lover
of mankind, that Thy Name, O Christ, may be hymned by all, and that we may
glorify Thy salvific love for mankind.
Verse: Their souls * shall dwell among good things.
Knowing Thee to be, in Thy divine power, the Lord of the living and Master
of the dead, О Christ, we pray Thee: With Thy chosen ones, О Lover of mankind,
grant rest unto Thy faithful servants who have departed unto Thee, our
Benefactor, in a place of comfort, amid the splendors of the saints; for Thou art
He Who willest mercy, and as God savest those whom Thou didst create
according to Thine image, О only greatly Merciful One.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Thou wast shown to be a receptacle of divine majesty, О most pure one, for
thou didst contain God and gave birth unto Christ in two natures but a single
Hypostasis, О Mother who knewest not wedlock. О pure one, entreat thine onlybegotten and firstborn Child, Who preserved thee an unblemished virgin even
though thou hast given birth, that He grant rest amid light and incorrupt
blessedness unto those who have fallen asleep in the Faith.

Remember me, О God my Savior, when Thou shalt come in Thy kingdom,
and save me, in that Thou alone lovest mankind.
Undaunted by fire, the sword, or the savage onslaught of wild beasts, О
glorious passion-bearers, ye have been deemed worthy of life everlasting.
О Lover of mankind, and Who hast glorified the prophets and teachers, the
venerable and the righteous, by their supplications save Thou our souls
For the reposed: Those who in faith have departed from temporal things do
