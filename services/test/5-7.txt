FRIDAY EVENING: TONE V
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, these Stichera of the Saints, in Tone V:
Spec. Mel.: “Rejoice ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
With the streams of their blood the passion-bearers quenched the flame of
grievous ungodliness; and enkindling the radiance of piety throughout the whole
world, they utterly consumed the false gods and their fetid stench. They have
shone forth the most pure light upon those on earth, and enlightened thereby, we
elude the darkness of ungodliness and evade the delusion of idols, worshipping
Christ, Who granteth the world great mercy.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
Easily setting at naught the words of the ungodly heretics and their pursuit, ye
became warriors of the beginningless Father, the Son Who is equally without
beginning, and the Holy Spirit, the Unity of Divinity in three Hypostases, teaching
the faithful with piety of mind and confirming the preaching of Orthodoxy.
Wherefore, ye are called blessed, О most sacred pastors, for in life-bearing
pastures ye tended the flock of Christ, for Whom ye endured all manner of pangs
and many and varied trials.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
Receiving mastery of mind through the doing of virtuous deeds, the company
of the venerable, who struggled, with ease utterly trampled the carnal passions
underfoot. Thereby they valiantly overcame all the wiles of the demons and were
revealed to be conversers with the angels, since they lived as ones incorporeal.
And they now rejoice in the mansions on high, living in splendor, and standing
before Christ, beseech Him to grant our souls great mercy.
These Stichera for the martyrs, in the same tone:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
Girding themselves with the shield of faith, and arming themselves with the
sign of the Cross, Thy saints O Lord, bravely gave themselves over to torments,
casting down the pride and delusion of the devil. By their supplications, O God
almighty, send down peace upon the world, and great mercy upon our souls.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
Repeat: Girding themselves with the shield of faith ...,
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
Despising all things earthly, and bravely withstanding torture, ye were not
deprived of your goodly hope, but became heirs of the Kingdom of heaven. O ye
all-praised martyrs, since ye have boldness before God the Lover of mankind, ask
that peace be granted to the world, and great mercy to our souls.
Glory.,., Now & ever ..., Dogmatic Theotokion:
In the Red Sea of old * an image of the Bride who knew not wedlock was
depicted. * There Moses was the one who parted the sea, * here Gabriel is the
minister of the miracle. * At that time Israel marched dry-shod through the deep,
* now the Virgin doth seedlessly give birth to Christ. * The sea after Israel's
passage remained impassable; * the Immaculate one after bearing Emmanuel
remained incorrupt. * O God, who doth exist and is pre-eternal, * and hath
appeared as man, ** have mercy upon us.
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone VII:
Prokeimenon: O God, my helper art Thou, * and Thy mercy shall go
before me.
Verse: Rescue me from mine enemies, O God, and from them that rise up
against me redeem me.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, these Stichera, in Tone V:
Intercede on our behalf, O holy martyrs, that we may be delivered from our
iniquities: for unto you hath been given the grace to pray for us.
Verse: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, О
Lord.
With your souls filled with insatiable love, O holy martyrs, ye did not deny
Christ; and enduring divers wounds in sufferings, ye cast down the audacity of the
tyrants, and keeping the faith unaltered and unharmed, ye were translated to the
heavens. Wherefore, since ye have boldness before Him, ask that He grant us
great mercy.
Verse: Their souls * shall dwell among good things.
For the reposed: I called to mind the words of the Prophet, ‘I am but dust and
ashes.’ I went also to the tombs, and beheld the bones laid bare, and I said:
‘Which is the king or which the warrior, which the rich man or which the beggar, 
which the righteous or which the sinner?’ But grant rest with the righteous, O
Lord, to Thy servants, as the Lover of mankind.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O thou who art full of joy, intercede by thy supplications, and beg that a
multitude of compassions, and the cleansing of our many sins, be granted to our
souls, we entreat thee.
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

Virgin, and torment awaiteth me in the future. Deliver me from such, for I come
to thee with an unwavering heart, and I call upon thy divine protection.
Canon of the Departed
Irmos: O Thou who art God's Mother transcending mind and word, * who
ineffably in time * hast given birth unto the Timeless One, * Thee do we
the faithful magnify with one accord.
Refrain: Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel.
Having received rewards for their sacred sufferings, the martyrs now beseech
Thee to grant remission unto those who have departed in faith, О Savior.
Refrain: Grant rest, О Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants.
Thou didst endure death, О only immortal Savior, granting resurrection and
the radiance of immortality unto the dead, in that Thou art compassionate.
Glory ..., Thou didst set us aright who have fallen into death, and didst teach
us to hope for everlasting life, which do Thou grant unto Thy servants.
Now & ever ..., The shadows of the Law have passed away at thy birthgiving,
О Theotokos; truth hath shone forth, and grace hath been bestowed; wherefore,
we magnify thee.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Praises, these Stichera of the martyrs, in Tone V:
Verse: Praise Him for His mighty acts, * praise Him according to the
multitude of His greatness.
To the Martyrs: Blessed is the army of the heavenly King: for though the
passion-bearers were born of this earth, spurning the pangs of their bodies they
hastened to attain to the dignity of the angels; and through their sufferings were
deemed worthy of the honour of the incorporeal hosts. By their prayers, O Lord,
send down upon us great mercy.
Verse: Praise Him with the sound of trumpet, * praise Him with the
psaltery and harp.
Thy passion-bearers, O Lord, emulating the life of the angelic ranks; endured
tortures as though incorporeal, in oneness of mind possessing the hope of the
blessings promised them. By their intercessions, O Christ God, grant peace to Thy
world, and great mercy to our souls.
Verse: Praise Him with timbrel and dance, * praise him with strings and
flute.
The holy martyrs struggled here on earth, enduring cold and given over to fire
and water. And as the waters received them, they cried aloud: “We went through
fire and water, and Thou didst bring us out into refreshment!” By their prayers, О
Christ God, have mercy upon us!
Verse: Praise Him with tuneful cymbals, praise Him with cymbals of
jubilation. * Let every breath praise the Lord.
Rejoicing in the midst of their torments, the saints cried aloud: “These things
are goods with which we may trade with the Lord: for, instead of the wounds we
bear on our bodies, radiant vesture shall blossom forth for us upon our
resurrection; instead of dishonor, we shall receive crowns; instead of fetters in
prison, we shall receive paradise; and instead of condemnation with malefactors,
we shall have life with the angels!” By their supplications, О Lord, save Thou our
souls!
For the reposed: Thou hast fashioned me, O Lord, and set Thine hand upon
me; and Thou hast commanded me, saying; ‘To the earth shalt thou return once
more.’ Guide me on Thy right path, forgive me my transgressions, and absolve
and save me, I pray Thee, O Lover of mankind.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Theotokion: Alas, O wretched soul! What answer wilt thou have to give to the
Judge at that hour when the thrones are set for judgment and the Judge
descendeth from the heavens, with myriads of angels? When He is seated upon
the judgment seat to try His unprofitable servants like me, what shalt thou bring
forth then? Truly naught, having defiled thy mind and body, wherefore, fall down
before the Virgin, and cry without ceasing, that she grant thee abundant
forgiveness of sins!
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the departed, in Tone V:
Spec. Mel.: “Rejoice ...”:
With the light of Thy countenance, O Christ, enlighten those who have
departed, as Thou art compassionate, and lead them to a place of verdure, beside
the waters of Thy pure divine repose. In the longed for bosom of our forefather
Abraham, where Thy light shineth in purity, and the springs of love ever pour
forth, where the assemblies of all the righteous rejoice and exult in Thy goodness.
Number Thy servants with them, and grant them great mercy. ‘
Verse: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, O
Lord.
О Compassionate One, be Thou well-pleased to grant those who have passed
from transitory things unto Thee, the Master of all and our God, all-harmonious
voices to hymn and glorify Thy might; and grant that they may be enlightened by
Thy beauty, and in a most pure manner partake of sweet and beauteous
communion with Thee, where the angels rejoice around Thy throne and the choirs
of the saints joyously stand round about. Grant rest with them and great mercy
unto Thy servants.
Verse: Their souls * shall dwell among good things.
Unto those who have fallen asleep in faith, grant rest with the choir of the
prophets, with the ranks of the apostles and the martyrs, and with all those who
from time immemorial, have been justified by Thy redeeming Passion and Thy
Blood, by which Thou hast ransomed captive mankind. In Thy love forgive them
all their offences, for Thou alone hast lived a sinless life upon the earth, Thou
alone art holy, Thou alone art free among the dead. Therefore grant unto Thy
servants rest and great mercy.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Theotokion: Having conceived Christ the King and Bestower of life, we who
were enslaved by the law of sin, O Lady, have been set free, O only Virgin
Mother. Through Him we are freely justified by grace. Entreat Him now to write
into the book of life, the names of those who acknowledge thee to be the
Birthgiver of God; that saved by Thy mediation, we may receive from Thy Son
redemption, worshipping Him Who granteth the world great mercy.
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON SATURDAY MORNING: TONE V
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone V:
Believing Thee to be God, the thief on the cross confessed Thee, О Christ,
crying out in purity from the depths of his heart: Remember me, О Lord, in Thy
kingdom!
Dying, О martyrs, ye destroyed the enemy, the author of evil, and, crowned
with divine victories, ye mounted on high, where ye stand before God, the King
of all.
Illumined by the light of the priesthood, О holy hierarchs, ye were glorified;
and the multitude of the venerable have received life everlasting. Wherefore, they
are blessed.
Those whom Thou hast taken to Thyself, О Master, do Thou cause to dwell
with the choirs of the elect in a place of ease, О Christ the Word, overlooking the
offenses they committed on earth.
Glory ..., О adored Trinity, be Thou entreated by the struggles of the holy
hierarchs and honored martyrs; and grant salvation and great mercy unto the souls
of those who departed in faith.
Now & ever ..., О divinely joyous one, thou didst contain Him Whom naught
can contain. Having given birth to Him in a manner transcending nature and all
telling, beseech Him, О Lady, to be merciful unto all.
