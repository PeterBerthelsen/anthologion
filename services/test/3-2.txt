SUNDAY EVENING: TONE III
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of compunction, in Tone III:
Spec. Mel.: “Great is the power of Thy martyrs ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
O heavenly father, accept me as Thou didst the repentant prodigal son, though
I sin exceedingly and embitter Thee, the good Master Who art merciful by nature;
and make me one of Thy hirelings.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
I have passed the time of my life in slothfulness and have drawn nigh to the
end, wretch that I am. I give no thought to the judgment which awaiteth me, nor
to my falling away from God. But, having turned me back to Thee, О Savior,
rescue me from them.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
From Gehenna, from the gnashing of teeth, and every other eternal retribution
do Thou deliver my lowly soul, О supremely good Lord; that with faith I may
hymn the merciful God, Who art by nature the Lover of mankind.
Then the Stichera of the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera of the holy incorporeal angels, in the same tone:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
Thou didst create the choirs of incorporeal beings, О Lord, unto all showing
forth the richness of Thy goodness; and out of non-existence Thou didst bring
into being those who now glorify Thy glory with never silent voices.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
Great is the power of Thine angels, О Christ; for, though bodiless, they
protect the world, preserving the Churches by Thy power, О Master; and they
entreat Thee on behalf of the whole world.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
Beholding Thy single and three-Sunned beauty, the hosts who minister to
Thee reveal derivative splendors to those in the world; and shining forth as one,
they impart divine glory unto us.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
О most pure one, who hast dominion over all creation, by thy fervent
intercession and maternal prayer free my mind, which is grievously beset by the
passions, and enslave me to thy Son and God.

Prokeimenon: Behold now, bless ye the Lord, * all ye servants of the Lord.
Verse: Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of
our God.

On the Aposticha, the Stichera of compunction, in Tone III:
Our evening hymnody do we bring to Thee, O Christ, with incense and
spiritual odes, Have mercy and save our souls.
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
Save me, O Lord my God, in so far as Thou art the salvation of all. For the
storm of the passions disquieteneth me, and the yoke of my transgressions
weigheth heavily upon me. Stretch out Thy helping hand and lead me up to the
light of compunction, for Thou alone art compassionate and the Lover of
mankind.
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: Great is the power of Thy Cross, О Lord! For though it was
planted in one place, it worketh throughout the whole world, making apostles of
fishermen and martyrs of the heathen, that they might pray for our souls.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
О Lady, intercessor for all who pray to thee: In thee we find boldness, of thee
do we boast, and in thee have we placed all our hope. Entreat Him Who was born
of thee on behalf of thine unprofitable servants.
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

the Sessional hymns of compunction, in Tone III:
Dwelling on earth, О my soul, repent, for dust doth not chant in the grave,
nor is it delivered from transgressions. But cry out to Christ God: О Thou Who
knowest the hearts of men, I have sinned against Thee! Before Thou judgest me,
have pity and mercy on me, О God.
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.
Wherefore, О my soul, dost thou continue in offenses? Wherefore dost thou

have mercy on me!
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Awed by the beauty of thy virginity * and the exceeding radiance of thy purity,

After the 2nd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone III:
At the dread judgment I shall denounce myself, there being no need for

be exposed. Wherefore, О God Who wilt examine my deeds at that universal trial,
cleanse me and save me.

Spec. Mel.: “Awed by the beauty of thy virginity ...”:
When we shall stand before Thine inexorable tribunal and divine judgment,
before which the hosts of heaven stand with trembling, how then shall I appear
before Thee, О most righteous Judge? I have done deeds worthy of
condemnation and fire. Yet at the supplications of Thine angels have pity on me
then, and save me!
By Thy word Thou didst bring into being those in heaven and those on earth,
in that Thou art almighty; and the angelic choirs, standing before Thee with fear,
offer Thee unceasing hymnody, О Master, illumining all the ends of the earth with
Thy light. And with them we also cry out to Thee: In Thy tender compassion save
us!
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
As an uncultivated vine, O Virgin, * thou didst sprout forth the most comely
Cluster of grapes * Which poureth forth upon us the wine of salvation * making
glad the souls and bodies of all. * Wherefore, ever blessing thee as the cause of
good things, * with the angel we cry out to thee: ** Rejoice, O thou who art full of
grace!

for, trampling underfoot the flame heated sevenfold, * they chanted:
Blessed art Thou, * O Lord God of our fathers!

Irmos: In His divine power the Lord descended into the flames * and was
seen walking with the Children of the Hebrews: * O ye priests, bless and
supremely exalt Him throughout all ages.
For his mockery Ham was declared a slave by his father’s sentence. And what
dost thou do, О my soul, enslaving thyself to the passions and riotously giving
thyself over to mockery, lacking all sense of shame before the heavenly father?
Mindlessly surrendering to enmity, Cain became the slayer of his brother. And
thou hast shown thyself to be like unto him, for though thou hast not slain
anyone, yet thou hast brought death upon thyself through the love of pleasures
and the deceptions of life, О my soul.
To the Martyrs: Assembling in faith, let us hymn as is meet the choice pearls of
the Lord, the precious vessels, the lamps shining with the radiance of divine grace,

О Word, by their prayers save those who fall down before Thee in repentance, for
Thou alone art merciful.

nigh unto Hades. О most tenderly compassionate Maiden, have pity and save me,
in that thou didst ineffably give birth to the loving God.

Irmos: The flame of material fire withered * through the immaterial flame
brought about by the god-seeing children, * wherefore they chanted: *
Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord!
As the Creator of all, by Thy thought Thou didst bring the angels into being;
and they stand before Thee with fear, crying aloud: Bless the Lord, all ye works of
the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!
Becoming like flames by partaking of the divine fire, the celestial intelligences
cry aloud: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him

thou hast given birth to the Word of the Father, incarnate, Whom all the works of
the Lord hymn and supremely exalt throughout all ages.
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.

Once, because of his temperance, Jacob received the birthright, and, unable to
restrain his stomach, Esau fell from his position as the elder son. How evil is
intemperance, and how great is abstinence! Cease committing evil deeds, О my
soul, and love the increase of good things.
Having endured many evils, the blameless Job was crowned; for the torrents
of temptations, rushing at him, did not shake the tower of his heart. Him do thou
ever emulate, remaining unaffected by the wiles of the evil one, О my soul.

be swords which cut down the hordes of the adversary, О passion-bearers of
Christ; and, glorified by great victories, ye have been crowned by the almighty
right hand of the King of all.
To the Martyrs: О ye multitude of martyrs, entreat God the Master, Who hath
accepted your ineffable toils and enrolled you in the armies of the incorporeal
ones, that He wash away the multitude of my countless evils.
Theotokion: О splendid palace of the Master, show me to be a dwelling-place
of light; О impassable gate, open unto me the ways of repentance; О holy land,
guide me to the land of the meek. О Lady, show me to be free of all the dominion
of the passions.
Canon of the Angels
Irmos: Wounded with the sweet arrow of thy most pure birthgiving, * О
pure one, * marveling at thy right desirable beauty, * with angelic hymnody
we magnify thee as is meet * as the Mother of God.
Standing now before the great and primal Light, О most divine angels of God,
ye have become most powerful advocates for all of us who magnify you as far as
we are able. (Twice)
Clearly deemed worthy to glorify the Trinity equal in power, and first illumined
by the effulgence thereof, grant us who piously magnify you, that we may be
illumined with reflected radiance.
Theotokion: We all know thee to be the foundation of our salvation; for by thy
deifying blood thy most pure birthgiving hath saved those who with faith hymn
and glorify thee, О Theotokos.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of compunction, in Tone III:
Gather the scattered thoughts of my mind, O Lord, and purify my barren and
wasted heart, granting me repentance as didst Thou to Peter, that like the Publican
I may sigh in sorrow, and like the Harlot shed tears, that I may cry with a loud
voice unto Thee: Save me, O God, for Thou alone art compassionate and the
Lover of mankind.
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
While offering a multitude of hymns, I am found to be sinning; for chanting
hymns with my tongue, my soul doth dwell on wicked thoughts. * But do Thou,
O Christ God set both aright through repentance, and have mercy upon me.
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: Come, О ye people, and let us all honor the memory of the
holy passion-bearers; for, having been a spectacle for angels and men, they
received crowns of victory from Christ, and pray on behalf of our souls.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
О pure Lady of the originate holiness, who art the boast of the heavenly ranks,
the subject of the apostles’ hymnody and the fulfillment of the prophets, accept
our supplications.
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON MONDAY MORNING: TONE III
AT THE LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone III:
Thou didst banish from paradise our forefather Adam, who had broken Thy
commandment, О Christ; but Thou didst cause to dwell therein the thief who
confessed Thee on the cross, crying: Remember me, О Savior, in Thy kingdom!
Overlooking the multitude of mine evils in the multitude of Thy mercy, О
Christ, save me, and on the dread day of condemnation deliver me from
everlasting torment, О Savior, that I may hymn Thy goodness.
О ye cherubim and seraphim, ye thrones, archangels, powers, principalities,
dominions, angels and all authorities, entreat the Creator, that, in that He is the
Lover of mankind, He overlook mine offenses when He shall come to judge the
earth.
To the Martyrs: Having dyed vesture for themselves in their sacred blood, in a
godly manner the spiritual athletes of Christ were truly deemed worthy to reign
with the King of the heavenly hosts; and they ask remission of transgressions for
us who ever honor them as is meet.
Glory ..., О ye faithful, piously hymning the one Godhead in three Hypostases:
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the Comforter: with the angels let us cry
out unceasingly with our voices: Holy, holy, holy art Thou, О God Who savest
our souls!
Now & ever ..., О pure one, thou radiant cloud, who hast given birth to the
Light from Light: Guiding to the Light me who have been darkened by the
passions and pleasures of life, set me aright, and pray that I may receive the glory
which those who lived righteously have now received.
On Monday, the Prokeimenon, in Tone IV:
Prokeimenon, in Tone IV: He maketh His angels spirits, * and His ministers a flame of fire.

magnified exceedingly.

hosts.
Verse: For He spake, and they came to be; He commanded, and they were
created.

flame of fire.
