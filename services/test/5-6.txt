THURSDAY EVENING: TONE V
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of the Cross, in Tone V:
Spec. Mel.: “O venerable father ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
Let all the groves of trees rejoice, beholding the most precious Tree which was
made joyous by the suffering of the Master, shining forth grace like a flame of fire,
pouring forth gifts upon all like water, and enlightening the thoughts of our souls,
washing away infirmities and driving away invisible passions, and manifestly
vanquishing foreign nations, ever granting to the faithful victories, blessing and
great mercy.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
Worshipping with faith the place where the feet of the Lord stood, as the
prophet said, let us glorify Christ Who was crucified, and with Himself crucified
our transgressions, Who abolished the curse which originated with a tree, and
reconciled with the Father those who had withdrawn far from Him through evil
thoughts; and venerating the nails of his hands and feet, the spear and the reed,
the sponge and the crown of thorns, and the insults and mockery, and all else He
endured, let us venerate them with honor, for by them we are saved.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
Let us crucify all our members with Christ, and let us die unto the world; and
desiring to walk in the footsteps of Christ, the Ruler of this world, let us take His
divine Cross upon our shoulder by rejecting the uprisings of the flesh and the evil
lusts which draw our souls into sin, thinking to stand before Him and to behold
Him nailed to the Cross, breathing His last and surrendering His soul into the
hands of the Father, that we may never be separated from Him.
Then the Stichera for the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera of the Theotokos, in Tone V, in the same melody:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
When thou didst behold hanging upon the Tree, the planted Cluster of grapes
Whom, like a vine, thou didst bring forth, with His divine side pierced by a spear,
thou didst exclaim crying aloud O most pure one: "What is this, O my Son and 
God? How is it that Thou Who dost heal all infirmities and sufferings, hath
undergone suffering, though Thou art dispassionate according to Thy divine
nature? How have the thankless people thus rewarded Thee for Thy benefactions,
O Benefactor?". By His sufferings pray thou that I may ever be free from
sufferings, that I may glorify thee.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
Let us all weep and lift up our hands, beating our breast, shedding fervent
tears, bending our knees, earnestly smiting our foreheads on the ground; and let us
who have angered God by unseemly deeds and the rejection of His commandments send sighs on high, crying out: By the supplications of Thy Mother,
deliver from all torment at the coming judgment those who have grieved Thee but
have converted, for whom, incarnate, Thou didst endure the Cross; and grant
them a share in Thy kingdom.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
Unto whom hast thou likened thyself, О my soul, ever prospering in bitter
works, and mindlessly adding so many stripes to thy wounds that thou art covered
with sores, giving no thought to the approach of the Judge, before Whom thou
must needs stand to receive retribution for thy guilt according to thy deeds? But
turning, fall down before the Virgin, crying out: О Lady, О Lady, disdain me not
who have angered the right merciful God Who was born from thee for the
salvation of all, and was crucified in the flesh!
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: Desiring that all receive salvation, O my sinless Christ,
Thou wast pleased to pay a great price, Thy precious blood, for our deliverance.
Wherefore, beholding Thee nailed, Thy Mother, lamenting, rent her hair, saying:
"O Child, mine all-immaculate Lamb, Who desirest to deliver the world by Thy
precious blood, how hast Thou set to whence I cannot see, O never-setting Sun,
Who grantest unto all enlightenment, peace and great mercy?"
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone VI:
Prokeimenon: My help cometh from the Lord, * Who hath made heaven
and the earth.
Verse: I have lifted up mine eyes to the Mountains, from whence cometh
my help.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the Cross, in Tone V:
Spec. Mel.: “Rejoice ...”:
О Lord, of old, in the time of Moses the Prophet, the image of Thy Cross,
having been precisely revealed, vanquished Thine enemies; and now, possessed of
that same Cross, we ask Thy help: Strengthen Thy Church, for the sake of Thy
great mercy, О Lover of mankind!
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
Though a tree visible by nature, Thy Cross, О Christ, is invested with divine
power; and being tangibly revealed to the world, it wondrously and noetically
worketh our salvation. Bowing down before it, we glorify Thee, О Savior. Have
mercy on us!
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: Despising all the things of earth, and manfully braving
tortures, ye did not fail to attain your divine hopes, but became heirs to the
kingdom of heaven, О most lauded martyrs. And as ye have boldness before God
Who is the Lover of mankind, ask peace for the world and great mercy for our
souls.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: Of old, the Virgin Mother, the all-blessed Maiden, beholding
the Lamb, her Son, lifted up upon the Cross, cried out, weeping: ''Woe is me, O
my Son! How is it that Thou diest Who art in essence God immortal?"
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.
THURSDAY NIGHT: TONE V
AT COMPLINE
Canon of Supplication to the Most Holy Theotokos
ODE I
Irmos: Christ, who with an upraised arm * bringeth wars to naught, * hath
shaken horse and rider in the Red Sea; * but Israel hath He saved * as they
chanted a song of victory.
We know thee to be another, noetic garden of paradise, О Virgin Bride of
God, beyond compare surpassing the Garden of Eden, О Mother of God; for
thou hast budded forth incorruption for mankind.
In paradise Adam was hindered from touching the tree of life, having partaken
of the fruit of knowledge; but the Fruit received from thee hath given him
immortality.
Glory ..., Adam was the first man created from earth by the most pure hands
of the Almighty; but thou, О Virgin Theotokos, hast given birth without seed to
the new Adam, the Creator of mankind.
Now & ever ..., The uttermost abyss of boundless transgressions hath
engulfed me, and led me down into the depths of grievous despondency. О thou
who hast given birth to the Abyss of loving-kindness, hasten thou and save me!
ODE III
Irmos: By Thy command Thou didst establish the earth upon nothing *
and suspended it unsupported; * do Thou establish Thy Church on the
unshakeable rock of Thy commandments, O Christ, * who alone art good *
and the Lover of mankind.
О immutable Word of God, Who didst make the earth the mother of living
plants which did not exist on it in the beginning: Thou hast straightway come
forth, seedlessly incarnate, from the woman who knew not a man, as from the
earth.
Thou art the hope and help, the joy, protection and refuge of mortals, О Lady
and Mother of life; wherefore, we pray: Send down thine aid upon all who hymn
thee.
Glory ..., Afflicted and stuck fast by grievous perils, О compassionate
Accomplisher of all, Who art the God of all, we all set Thy thrice-holy tabernacle
to pray before Thee, and we cry unto Thee: Loose Thou the bonds of Thy
servants!
Now & ever ..., The billows of sin cruelly batter me and drag me down into
the abyss of transgressions; and the tempests of adverse thoughts batter my soul.
О thou who hast given birth to the Helmsman, hasten thou to rescue thy servant.
ODE IV
Irmos: Habbakuk, prophetically apprehending * Thy divine self-emptying,
O Christ, * cried out to Thee with trembling: * Thou hast come for the
salvation of Thy people; * to save Thine anointed Ones.
In submitting to the serpent, Eve begat grief for women; but having believed
the tidings of God, О Virgin, thou didst cause Joy to blossom forth for the whole
world.
Eve was first formed from the rib of Adam of old; and now God is begotten
of the Mother and Bride of God: He is born, incarnate without a father, from the
Virgin.
Glory ..., Eve rejoiceth, for the Maiden who incorruptly conceived the Judge
and gave birth to the Compassionate One, hath shown her first mother to be free
from the ancient curse.
Now & ever ..., My life hath been filled with transgressions, my mind is
plagued with passions, and my soul is condemned; wherefore, in thy compassion,
have mercy and save me, О Lady.
ODE V
Irmos: O Thou Who hast clothed Thyself in light as with a garment, * I rise
early unto Thee and cry out to Thee: * Enlighten my darkened soul, O
Christ, * in that Thou alone art compassionate!
Having found thee to be a pillar and cloud of light, О Virgin Mother of the
Bestower of light, we who walk in the wilderness of deception escape evils.
Rejoice, О thou who hast given birth in the flesh to God Who before the ages
was incorporeally begotten of the Father, and hath been well-pleased to appear to
us openly.
Glory ..., The sun hath been surpassed by thy radiance, О Mary; for thou hast
held in thine arms Him Who adorned the sky with luminaries, and didst feed Him
at thy breast.
Now & ever ..., Condemn me not to the unquenchable fire, О Christ my
Savior, by the supplications of the pure one who gave birth to Thee.
ODE VI
Irmos: Calm the raging sea of the passions, * O Master Christ, * with its
soul-destroying tempest, * and lead me up from corruption * in that Thou
art compassionate.
О pure Ever-virgin, without sustaining harm thou didst bear in thy womb the
wondrous God Who of old saved the Prophet Jonah in the sea monster.
Bearing the Lord God of hosts Who restraineth the storms of the sea, О most
pure Virgin, thou didst still the briny billows of delusion.
Glory ..., Having given birth to Christ, the Peace of all, О most pure one, by
thy prayers to Him tame the raging storms of the passions which assail me.
Now & ever ..., On the day of grief, when the bonds holding soul and body
together will be severed, intercede for me, and rescue me from the surrounding
demons.
Lord, have mercy, (Thrice).
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Sessional hymn, in Tone V:
Beholding Thee willingly hanging upon the Cross between two thieves, О
Christ, Thy Mother, her maternal womb rent with pain, exclaimed: “O my sinless
Son, how have they unjustly crucified Thee on the Cross as a malefactor, Thee
Who desireth to bring life to the race of mankind, in that Thou art supremely
good?”
ODE VII
Irmos: The supremely exalted Lord of our fathers * quenched the flame, *
and bedewed the Youths * as they chanted in harmony: * O God, blessed
art Thou!
God Who made a journey to meet with Abraham the forefather became thy
Son, О blessed one; and He made his seed a blessing for the nations.
Thou art the ladder of Jacob, О undefiled one; for God depicted thee as the
one Mother, for whose sake God gathered together his children.
Glory ..., The incarnate Son, Who is supremely exalted with the Father and the
Spirit, having chosen thee, О pure one, loved thee exceedingly, that thou mightest
become a dwelling-place for Him.
Now & ever ..., Do thou ever entreat the God to Whom thou hast given birth,
that He save me, wretch though I am, and accept me, the simple one who cries
out with faith: Blessed art Thou, О God!
ODE VIII
Irmos: Unto Thee the Fashioner of all, * the children in the furnace
chanted a hymn: * All ye works of the Lord, * supremely exalt Him
throughout all ages.
Thy birthgiving eludes examination, О Virgin, and is revealed to those who cry
out with faith: All ye works of the Lord, hymn ye the Lord, and supremely exalt
Him throughout the ages!
In nowise having fallen from the glory of virginity, thou hast been enriched
also with the honor of motherhood, О thou who knewest not wedlock. He Who
worketh wonders hath made this clearly known, and we supremely exalt Him
throughout the ages.
Glory ..., Behold the affliction of my lowly soul, О most pure one, and quickly
deliver me from pain, that I may glorify thee throughout the ages.
Now & ever ..., Mercifully accept Thy Mother, who prayeth that Thou save
Thy people, whom Thou hast acquired by Thy precious Blood, О good Word,
that we may call Thee blessed throughout all ages.
ODE IX
Irmos: O Isaiah, rejoice and be glad! * The Virgin hath conceived in her
womb, * and hath borne a Son, Emmanuel, * who is both God and man; *
and Orient is His name; * Him we magnify, and the Virgin we call blessed.
О Lady Theotokos, entreat the adored Trinity, to Whom alone thou hast given
birth for us without suffering in the flesh, that He grant peace to those on earth,
and that remission of sins be granted to those who hymn thee.
Even though Emmanuel is understood to be a single Person, yet He hath two
natures; for, lo! we proclaim two wills and activities in Him, and we confess thee,
His Mother, to be the Theotokos.
Glory ..., I utter lamentation for myself, pondering the multitude of my sins,
the uprisings of my passions, the despondency of my soul and the inconstancy of
my mind. Grant salvation to me, wretch that I am,
Now & ever ..., Assailing me like brigands, and stripping me of my radiant and
luminous vesture, mine enemies have inflicted many wounds upon me. О Lord,
raise me up who am barely alive.
Then, “It is truly meet ...,” and a prostration. Trisagion through Our Father ...,
Troparia, and the rest as usual. Dismissal.
ON FRIDAY MORNING: TONE V
AT MATINS
After the 1st chanting of the Psalter,

unto our gladness. Glory be to Thee!
Verse: Exalt ye the Lord our God, * and worship the footstool of His feet,
for He is holy.
О ye faithful, let us hymn our Savior and Redeemer, Who was willingly
crucified, as He Himself knew and was well-pleased to do; and let us glorify Him,
for He hath nailed the sins of all to the Cross, delivering the race of mankind from
delusion, and hath granted us the kingdom.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: Beholding Thee hanging willingly on the Cross between the
thieves, О Christ, Thy Mother said maternally, her womb rent with pain: “O my
sinless Son, how is it that Thou art unjustly nailed to the Cross as a malefactor,
Who desirest to give life to the race of mankind, in that Thou art compassionate?”
After the 2nd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone V:

To the Martyrs: Today the memory of the passion-bearers shineth forth with
radiance from the heavens; the choir of the angels keepeth festival, and the race of
mankind celebrateth with them. Wherefore, they pray unto the Lord, that our
souls find mercy.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: Through the Cross of thy Son, O thou who art full of the
grace of God, hath the deception of idolatry been utterly vanquished, and the
might of the demons hath fallen; wherefore, we, the faithful, ever hymn and bless
thee as is meet, confessing thee to be the true Theotokos.
After the 3rd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone V:
Spec. Mel.: “The co-beginningless Word ...”:
When the ranks of the angels beheld Thee nailed to the Cross and having
fallen asleep, О Jesus, King of all, they were stricken with awe; and straightway the
hordes of the demons fled, and the gates of Hades were broken, the tyranny of
death was cast down, and those dead in the grave arose.
Adam received bitterness from the tree, falling headlong into corruption
through the envy of the serpent; but when Thou wast nailed thereto О Jesus, life
was planted, and because of the tree of the Cross we have once again made our
abode in the heavens, the serpent hath been set at naught, corruption hath been
slain, and we all offer Thee glory.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: When the Mother who bore Thee without the pangs of
childbirth beheld Thee lifted up upon the Cross, weeping, she lamented crying
aloud: ‘‘Woe is me, O my sweetest Son! I am wounded in depths of my soul,

Irmos: Unto God the Savior * Who made His people pass dryshod through
the sea, * but drowned Pharaoh with all his host, * unto Him alone let us

in that He is good, О pure one, the Son of God hath delivered all from the
corruption of the serpent.

grace driving away the clouds of sicknesses; and by faith in the Trinity they
dispelled the gloom of ungodliness.

thyself have mercy upon me!
Thy prayer is sure and certain, О all-immaculate one, for whatsoever things
thou desirest thou givest, entreating thy Son and God. Wherefore, I pray thee:
Have mercy and save my lowly soul!
I am cruelly tested by bodily sickness, rising passions and wounds of soul. О
thou who hast given birth to the only Benefactor, by thy supplications restore my
health.

Irmos: Thee the true Mother of God, * who above all understanding * and
beyond all description, * ineffably brought forth in time * the Eternal One,

The might and dominion of the enemy were taken away, О only mighty Lord,

Why dost thou not arise? Wherefore, before the end hasten thou to repent.
Deliver me from evil transgressions and tribulations. Grant me mercy, О allpure Virgin, and a divine share in incorruptible life.

idols was driven away and grace blossomed forth; for the tyranny of
condemnation was found no more, but the triumph of our salvation was made
manifest. For the Cross is our boast, the Cross is our confirmation, the Cross is
our joy!
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
For our sake Thou wast led as a sheep to sacrifice and as an innocent lamb to
voluntary slaughter, О Christ Immanuel; and Thou wast reckoned among the
iniquitous. Come, О ye nations of the homeland, and hymn and worship the
endless Life Who was lifted up upon the Cross!
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: Blessed is the army of the King of heaven, for even though
the passion-bearers were mortal, yet they strived to attain the dignity of the angels;
and having spurned their bodies, for the sake of their passions they have been
deemed worthy of honors. By their supplications, О Lord, save Thou our souls!
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: Standing at the foot of the Cross, О Jesus, she who gave
birth to Thee lamented, weeping and cried aloud: “I cannot bear these things,
seeing Thee to Whom I gave birth nailed to the Tree! I escaped the pangs of 
childbirth, since I never knew a husband, so how now am I wracked with pain and
wounded in heart? For now the words spoken by Symeon have been fulfilled: ‘A
sword shall pierce thy heart, О immaculate one!’ Yet now arise, О my soul, and
save those who hymn Thee!”
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON FRIDAY MORNING: TONE V
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone V:
Believing Thee to be God, the thief on the cross confessed Thee, О Christ,
crying out in purity from the depths of his heart: Remember me, О Lord, in Thy
kingdom!
Dying on the Cross, О compassionate Bestower of life, Thou gavest life unto
Adam, upon whom death had come through eating, and Thou didst show him to
be a dweller in paradise, О Good One.
Thou wast nailed to the Cross, О Christ, Thou true vine, and hast poured
forth the fluid of salvation, giving drink through grace unto the hearts of all the
faithful.
To the Martyrs: When ye were beaten and dismembered, О wise ones, ye
emulated the sacrifice of the Master; wherefore, ye are ever called blessed, О
martyrs of Christ.
Glory ..., With faith we worship Thee, the one God in three Hypostases, the
indivisible and supremely divine Essence; and we cry out to Thee: Glory be to
Thee, О Trinity and Unity, our God!
Now & ever ..., She who beheld our Life dead of His own will upon the tree of
the Cross, beat her breast, weeping; wherefore, we all ever bless her with divine
voices.
