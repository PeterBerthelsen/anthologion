Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
Lift up thine eyes, О my soul, and behold the dispensation and tender
compassion of God: how having bowed down the heavens, He descended to the
earth, that He might raise thee up from the wretched state of thy passions, and set
thee upon the rock of faith. О the wonder of this awesome miracle! Glory to
Thine abasement, О Lover of mankind!
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
Behold thine exceedingly iniquitous works, О my soul, and marvel that the
earth still beareth thee, that it hath not been driven asunder, that the wild beasts
do not devour thee, that the ever-shining Sun hath not ceased to shine upon thee.
Arise, repent, and cry out to the Lord: I have sinned against Thee, I have sinned!
Have mercy on me!
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
Trusting in thee, О omnipotent Lord, we beseech Thee, that we be delivered
from all tribulations, sufferings and turmoil; that we may pass our life in peace;
and, having lived in purity, may find Thee, our Master, merciful on the day of
judgment.

the Lord abideth forever.

wickedness, dispelling their darkness.
Glory..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
With the angels let us all cry out to the Theotokos in hymns, for she gave birth

of our souls hath given us inexhaustible sustenance.

our God.

On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone VII:
I have come, О Compassionate One, like the prodigal son. As one of Thy
hirelings do Thou accept me who fall down before Thee, О God, and have mercy
on me, О Thou Who lovest mankind.
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
Like the one who fell among thieves and was wounded, so have I fallen
through many sins, and my soul hath been wounded. To whom shall I who am
guilty flee? To Thee alone, the Physician of men’s souls. О God, pour forth upon
me Thy great mercy.
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: Glory to Thee, О Christ God, Thou boast of the apostles and
joy of the martyrs, who preached the consubstantial Trinity!
Glory..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
With the angel we cry out to thee, Rejoice! O Bride of God, * calling thee the
bridal-chamber and portal, * the fiery throne and unquarried mountain, ** and

** the Savior of our souls.
After the 2nd chanting of the Psalter,
The Sessional hymns of repentance, in Tone VII:

the harlot; for in my blindness I am at a loss how to make any such amendment.
But in Thy tender compassion, О Christ God, save me, in that Thou lovest
mankind.
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.

didst the prodigal son, О greatly merciful Jesus.
Prepare thyself in this thy life, О my soul, and have no doubt concerning the
life to come; for then thou wilt have no-one to help thee, neither riches, power,
friends nor princes. There will only be the disclosure of thy deeds, and God’s love

unceasingly cry out immaterially: “Holy art Thou, О Lord!”, saving our souls.

from, the principalities cry out with unceasing magnifications: О God of our
fathers, blessed art Thou!
Theotokion: О Birthgiver of God, without seed thou hast given birth to the
one Christ, the God of our fathers: a single Hypostasis in two natures, Who
executes His awesome dispensation.
ODE VIII
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: Unconsumed by fire, the bush on Sinai spake unto Moses, * slow of
speech and stammering, * and revealed God unto him; * and zeal for God
showed forth the three Children who chanted hymns * to be unvanquished
by the fire. * O all ye His works, praise ye the Lord * and supremely exalt
Him throughout all ages.
I received the Word like a radiant lamp-stand, but, wretch that I am, I have

Theotokion: Having ineffably received the unapproachable Light within thy
womb, О Virgin Theotokos, thou hast enlightened those in the darkness of life,

Irmos: О ye faithful, with hymns let us magnify the Theotokos, * who in a
manner transcending nature became a mother, * and is a Virgin by nature,

bring thee the fruit of almsgiving.
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we

Like the faithful Canaanite woman I cry out in the pain of my heart: Have
mercy on me, О Savior, in that Thou art good; for ever tempest-tossed I have a
soul beset by all the wiles of the enemy!
The cherubim and seraphim, the thrones, principalities and powers, the
archangels, the armies of angels, the dominions and most wise authorities, ever
glorify Thee, О Lord our Benefactor.
Uplifted unto God, the spiritual athletes utterly cast down the wicked uprisings
of the enemy; and, revealed as victors, they now live amid joy in the heavens,
resplendent in incorrupt glory.
Glory ..., О indivisible Trinity, Unity in a single nature, Being in three
Hypostases: With the hosts on high we worship Thee, О Father, Son and Holy
Spirit: the one Godhead, the one Power, saying: There is but one God, the consubstantial Trinity!
Now & ever ..., I have defiled myself with the pleasures of life, but have fled
unto thee, the undefiled one, О Virgin. Deliver my most accursed soul from every
lust and offense, that I may bless thee, the ever-blessed one.
