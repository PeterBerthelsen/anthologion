Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
Emulating the Canaanite woman, О my soul, touch Christ from behind, and
cry out repeatedly: Have mercy on me, О Master! My body, like her daughter, is
possessed by evil spirits, and it flaileth about. Quench the burning of my flesh, I
pray; and, causing the disorderly seizures to cease, mortify it by the fear of Thee,
by the prayers of her who conceived and gave birth to Thee, and of all the saints,
О greatly merciful Benefactor.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
Thou didst once send Jonah to the sinful Ninevites to preach to them, О
Christ, and, repenting, they transformed their anger into kindliness, having been
delivered from pernicious wrath. Wherefore, send also Thy mighty help unto me,
who am unworthy, О Lover of mankind, that I may turn away from my countless
offenses and be guided to the path of repentance; for I weep, groaning bitterly,
that I may be delivered by Thy mercy from my many transgressions.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
О Compassionate One, Who camest into the world to save sinful men and call
them to repentance: In that Thou art full of tender compassion, have pity on me
who have angered Thee more than all others, save me in Thy goodness, guide me
to the way of repentance, and grant me thought of compunction, in Thy goodness
making my heart steadfastly humble, simple, meek and guileless, О my Savior, in
that Thou art full of loving-kindness.
Then the Stichera, of the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera of the holy & great John the Forerunner, in Tone IV:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
O Forerunner, who hast boldness before the Lord, and who dost surpass all
born from women: Unceasingly entreat Him on behalf of those who pray to thee
with faith, that He grant us conversion and a beginning to repentance, that, saved,
we may ever hymn thee.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
Thou wast called a prophet from thy mother’s womb and a preacher from her
belly, О Forerunner and Apostle of the coming of the Lord. I have given myself
over to the demons and am become an industrious slave to sin. As a mighty
warrior cure me of both these sins, that I may proclaim thy speedy help.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
As the winnowing-fan of the divine Spirit, winnow away like weeds the ways
of my heart, gathering divine deeds from me, to store like grain in the granary of
God, that, enriched by thee, my mediator, I may become food fit for the Master,
О blessed one who baptized Christ,
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Grant me tears from the depths of my heart, sighing from the depths of my
soul, О Maiden, and contrition and confession of the transgressions I have
committed in this life, that by thy help, О all-pure one, I may pass my life in
repentance and receive remission.

On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone IV:
I wish to wash away the record of my sins with tears, O Lord, * and please
Thee the rest of my life through repentance; * but the enemy deceiveth me and
fights against my soul. * Before the end and I utterly perish, ** save me, O Lord.
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
Who, among the tempest-tossed, * having taking refuge in Thy harbor, * will
not be saved O Lord? * Or who, that aileth and falling down in Thine infirmary, *
will not be healed? * O Maker of all that is, and Physician of the ailing, * before
the end, may I not utterly perish, ** save me, O Lord.
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: О Lover of mankind, * as One Who hast accepted the
patience of the holy martyrs, * by their prayers ** grant us great mercy.

Irmos: O almighty Redeemer of all, * having descended and bedewed the
children * in the midst of the flame, * Thou didst teach them to sing: * All
ye works bless and hymn the Lord.
By thy radiant supplication, О Forerunner, guide me aright, who am beset by
the sleep of despondency and darkened by the gloom of evil; and grant that I may
walk nobly in the daylight of the virtues.
The storm of temptations besets me, and the waves of the passions engulf me.
Grant me thy hand, О Forerunner, by thy supplications bringing the ship of my
soul up to the harbor of repentance.
О blessed Forerunner John, who in the river’s waters baptized Him Who
taketh away the sins of the world: With the streams of thy prayers dry up the abyss
of mine evils.
Seeing the Holy Spirit, thou didst hear the voice of the Father bearing witness
to Jesus, Who was ineffably baptized by thee, О Forerunner. Him do thou entreat,
that He save us.
Theotokion: As the Source of our restoration, wholly renew me who have
been undone by the sting of the serpent, that I may bless thee with faith and love,
О all-immaculate Virgin Theotokos.
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: The God of Israel hath shown strength with His arm, * for He hath
put down the mighty from their thrones, * and exalted them of low degree * 
The daystar from on high Who hath visited us, * and firmly established us
on the path of peace.
Behold! the mystical bridal-chamber hath been opened, and the wise, having
replenished their lamps with the oil of the virtues, radiantly enter it in. Shake off
the sleep of despondency, О my soul, that, bearing thine own lamp, thou mayest
enter in with Christ.
Like the harlot I noetically clasp Thy feet and bathe them in my tears, О
Word. Wash away the mire of the passions, О Savior, saying to me now: “Thy
faith hath saved thee!”, that I may hymn Thine incalculable tender compassion.
To the Martyrs: With gladdened heart and joyful soul the martyrs dwell in the
highest, ever having the wounds of Christ as an adornment of majesty; and they
let fall upon us the dew of peace, deliverance from evils, and the remission of sins.
To the Martyrs: Every place that hath your relics is sanctified, О godly spiritual
athletes, like another ark such as that which delivered Israel from evils. And the
heavens rejoice with the honored angels, О blessed ones, having acquired your
souls.
Theotokion: О right loving Maiden, who hast given birth to the right-loving
God, I cry out to thee: Bless thou my wretched soul, which hath been grievously
oppressed by the passions and the assaults of evil demons, that with faith I may
hymn thee, the hope of all.
Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: Eve dwelt under the curse of sin * because of the infirmity of
disobedience; * but thou, O Virgin Theotokos, * hast through the
Offspring of thy pregnancy * blossomed forth blessing upon the world. *
Wherefore, we all magnify thee.
Christ the Lord is my strength and my song. Him do thou entreat, О blessed
Forerunner, that He strengthen me against the passions and against every assault
of the demons; and grant that I may do His divine will, that I may ever bless thee
with love.
Thou hast been shown to be a beauteous turtledove and a melodious swallow,
О divine Forerunner, heralding the divine springtime of Christ. Him do thou
beseech, that He deliver me from the soul-corrupting winter and the tempest of
sin, I pray thee.
Leaping up in thy mother’s womb, thou didst announce Him Who shone
forth from the Virgin. Him do thou beseech, that He mortify the movements of
my flesh, which deaden me, that He fill my heart with joy, and I may hymn thee,
О divine Forerunner.
Behold and pay heed, О my soul! The sentence is inescapable for those who
do not act with mercy. Take then the oil which replenishes thy lamp, and keep it
un-extinguished, for the Bridegroom draweth nigh. Be vigilant, that thou mayest
have an unquenchable will.
Theotokion: О right loving Theotokos, who hast given birth to the right
loving God: Entreat Him to deliver me from all evil, and to make my heart
zealous for Him, hating the sweet pleasures of the flesh, that I may magnify thee
in hymns.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone IV:
Wash me with my tears, O Savior, * for I am defiled by many sins. *
Wherefore I fall down before Thee: * I have sinned, have mercy upon me, ** O
God.
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
I am a sheep of Thy rational flock, * and to Thee do I flee for refuge, * O
Good Shepherd. I have gone astray, ** do Thou O God, have mercy upon me.
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: Ye have become fellow partakers with the angels, * О holy
martyrs * who manfully preached Christ at the tribunal; * for ye forsook all the
beautiful things of this world * as though they though non-existent, * and clung to
the Faith as your steadfast hope. * Wherefore, having driven away delusion, *
pouring forth gifts of healing upon the faithful, ** unceasingly praying that our
souls be saved.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Preserve thou thy servants from all misfortunes, * O blessed Theotokos, * that
we all may glorify thee, ** the hope of our souls.
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON TUESDAY MORNING: TONE IV
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone IV:
Of old was Adam banished from paradise through the tree, but by the tree of
the Cross hath the thief come to dwell in paradise: the one by tasting rejected the
commandment of the Creator, but the other, crucified with Christ, confessed the
hidden God, crying aloud: Remember me in Thy kingdom!
О Word, Who accepted the weeping of Peter and the tears of the harlot, Thou
didst also have compassion upon the publican, who only sighed, О Christ, in that
Thou art full of tender compassion. О supremely good Lord, have mercy on me
who ask for forgiveness of my transgressions, and deliver me from everlasting
torment.
О great Forerunner, who broke the bonds of infertility, release my lowly heart
from its unfruitfulness, and by thy mediation make it bud forth virtuous deeds,
whereby I may receive inexhaustible sustenance, crying out to Christ: Remember
me, О Savior, when Thou comest in Thy kingdom!
To the Martyrs: Broken by tortures, thrown to wild beasts for devouring,
dismembered, cast into the depths of the sea, burned with fire and lacerated with
sharp implements, О wise and all-glorious martyrs, ye did not reject God. Him do
ye beseech, О saints, that He grant us peace, enlightenment and great mercy.
Glory ..., О ye faithful, in oneness of mind let us all entreat the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, that we may glorify as is meet the Unity of the Godhead, Who
existeth simply, without commingling, indivisibly and unapproachably, in three
Hypostases; for thereby are we delivered from fiery torment.
Now & ever ..., Having received in thy womb Him Who with the Father is
without beginning and with the Holy Spirit is co-enthroned, in a manner
transcending understanding and all telling thou hast given birth unto Him, Who
became a man in His benevolence toward mankind, О Mary Bride of God,
spacious habitation of our God. Him do thou earnestly beseech, that thy servants
be saved.
On Tuesday, the Prokeimenon in Tone VII:

God they shall blossom forth.
