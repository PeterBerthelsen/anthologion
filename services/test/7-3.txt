Spec. Mel.: “Judas keepeth watch today ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
O most compassionate Master and God, by the judgments which Thou
knowest grant that I may have the fear of Thee in my heart, that I may spurn the
works of the evil one, love Thee with all my soul, and do Thy saving will; for
Thou art our God, Who said: Ask, and ye shall receive.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
I have become a mockery for the demons and contemptible for men,
lamentation for the righteous and weeping for the angels, polluting the air, the
earth and the waters; for I have defiled my body and sullied my soul and mind
with countless evil acts, and have become an enemy to God. Woe is me, О Lord! I
have sinned, I have sinned against Thee! Forgive me!
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
I pray Thee: Be Thou patient with me, who am devoid of fruits, О Master, and
cut me not down like the barren tree with the axe of death, dispatching me to the
fire; but be Thou entreated to make me fruitful, giving me time for repentance, in
that Thou lovest mankind, that I may wash away my many sins, О Christ my
Savior.
Then the Stichera of the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera of the holy & great prophet John the Forerunner, in Tone VII:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
О Forerunner, who didst live a blameless life in the desert, restore thou my
mind, which hath become barren through sins.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
We glorify thee, О prophet, understanding thee to be the swallow heralding
the divine spring to those in the world.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.

On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone VII:
I have come, О Compassionate One, like the prodigal son. As one of Thy
hirelings do Thou accept me who fall down before Thee, О God, and have mercy
on me, О Lover of mankind.
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
Like the one who fell among thieves and was wounded, so have I fallen
through many sins, and my soul hath been wounded. To whom shall I who am
guilty flee? If not to Thee alone, the Physician of our souls. О God, pour forth
upon me Thy great mercy!
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: О holy martyrs, ye who have fought the good fight and
received crowns: Entreat the Lord, that He have mercy upon our souls.
Glory..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Rejoice, O Sovereign Lady, thou cloud of the noetic and ineffable Sun! *
Rejoice, all-luminous lantern: Rejoice all-golden candle-stand. * Through thee, O
most holy one, * hath Eve been delivered from the curse. * But as thou dost
possess boldness before thy Son and God * Who is readily moved to compassion,
* fail not to entreat Him by thy maternal supplication, ** O most pure one.
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

Thou didst spring forth from a sacred root, О prophet, wholly uprooting the
roots of evil, whereby I am choked and have become useless. О blessed one, set
me aright, that I may put forth the fruits of divine repentance.
The Church knoweth thee to be a most comely swallow and nightingale, О
great Forerunner; for thou didst sing the hymn of repentance to souls laid waste
and grown hard through evils. Wherefore, we bless thee with faith.
Unto all thou didst show the ways leading to the gates of salvation, О glorious
Forerunner. Strengthen me to walk them, for I am drawn into all the trackless
wastes of life and, beguiled, have committed evil.
The awesome day is nigh at hand, and bearing deeds worthy of condemnation,
I lament: Lord, О Lord, Who alone art merciful: through the prayers of Thy Forerunner and all the saints, show me then to be uncondemned.
Theotokion: О thou who art full of grace, who hast given birth to the divine
Light, illumine my soul, which hath been darkened by transgression, I pray, and
show me to be free of everlasting darkness, that I may magnify and glorify thee,
the ever-blessed one.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone VII:
Cut me not down, a sinner, like the barren fig-tree, О Savior, but grant that I
may tarry for many years, watering my soul with tears of repentance, that I may
bring thee the fruit of almsgiving.
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
As Thou art the Sun of righteousness, enlighten the hearts of those who sing
unto Thee: Glory be to Thee, О Lord!
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: Rejoicing amid the tribunal of the violators of the law, Thy
passion-bearers cried aloud: Glory be to Thee, О Lord!
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
From the Virgin Thou didst spring forth as light, О Christ, illumining the race
of mankind. Glory be to Thee, О Lord!
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON TUESDAY MORNING: TONE VII
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone VII:
Comely and good to taste was the fruit which brought death upon me. But
Christ is the Tree of life, and eating thereof I die not, but cry out with the thief:
Remember me in Thy kingdom, О Lord!
Treat the incurable sores of my heart, O Lord, for Thou alone art the
Physician of souls and bodies; and ever grant that I may tread aright the paths of
salvation.
О Baptist of Christ, who came before the Sun of righteousness, with thy
divine supplications light thou the lamp of my soul, which hath been extinguished
by my great evil, that, saved, I may ever bless thee.
To the Martyrs: Having suffered and been crowned, ye put the enemy to
shame, and now dwell in the heavens, full of unapproachable light, О most wise
martyrs, praying on behalf of our souls.
Glory ..., Heal Thou the incurable sufferings of my soul, О divine Trinity Who
art piously worshipped in a single Godhead, rescue me from Gehenna and
temptations, and grant me the eternal kingdom.
Now & ever ..., In thy womb thou didst contain the Uncontainable One
without confining Him. О pure Mother, ever beseech Him, that from all
oppression and the assaults of the passions He deliver thy servants who glorify
thee with love.
On Tuesday, the Prokeimenon in Tone VII:
