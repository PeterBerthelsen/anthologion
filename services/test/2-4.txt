ON TUESDAY EVENING: TONE: II
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of the Cross, in Tone II:
Spec. Mel.: “When from the Tree ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
When Thou didst set upon the Cross, О Word, * the luminaries, not bearing
to shine, dimmed their rays; * the earth quaked, and the rocks split asunder; * the
majesty of the temple was rent in twain; * the graves opened, and the dead arose; *
Hades released all who were below, * and the demons were vanquished; * and
death was reckoned by all ** to be but sleep.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord: my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
When the good-hearted thief beheld Thee, * the fruitful Vine, О Christ, * he
became a better thief * and yet more skilled, * for with a few words * he quite
simply * stole the forgiveness of ancient offenses. * Let us all, then, make haste to
emulate him, crying aloud: ** Remember us also, О Lover of mankind!
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
Truly Thy divine Cross * shineth like a star in the sky, О Christ, * burning up
the demons, shedding light upon the faithful, * and casting shame upon the faces
of those who crucified Thee. * By it Thou didst lead our first parents forth * from
the slavery caused by the tree * which was the image of the Cross, * and in the
desert didst cause Thy people ** to suck forth honey from the rock.
Then the Stichera of the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera of the Theotokos, in Tone II: in the same melody:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
He Who in His loving-kindness * clothed Himself in our nature through thee
* and underwent crucifixion and death for our sake, О Lady, * hath shown thee to
be the intercessor for all mankind, * the great refuge of all, * the helper of all
Christians. * Wherefore, unceasingly entreat Him, * that He send down upon all
the cleansing of transgressions, ** О Bride of God.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
Of old, beholding Him * Who was born from her womb * hanging upon the
Tree as one condemned, * between two thieves, * the Virgin and Ewe-lamb said,
exclaiming: * “O my Son and God, * strange is this awesome mystery to behold, *
and none is able to fathom the depths of Thy wisdom. ** wherefore I hymn Thy
long-suffering!”
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
“Where is the majesty of Thy countenance? * Where hath the beauty of Thy
comeliness hidden itself, О my Son? * How is it that Thou, О God * Who in Thy
goodness hast wrought ineffable things * and art beauteous in good things, * dost
hang suspended upon the Tree, * inglorious and dishonored, bereft of form and
beauty * for the sake of all mankind, О my Son?” ** thus cried out the most
virtuous Virgin, groaning and weeping.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: The light of the sun and moon dimmed, * obscured by the
noetic Light * Who hung naked upon the Cross; * for that which is lesser is ever
vanquished by the greater, * and the lower giveth place to the higher. * “How then
can it not be fitting * for perceptible radiance to hide itself before the radiant
Christ?” * the most pure one asked the worthy bodies of light, ** when she gazed
upon Thee.
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone I:
Prokeimenon: Thy mercy, O Lord, shall pursue me * all the days of my life.
Verse: The Lord is my shepherd, and I shall not want. In a place of green
pasture, there hath He made me to dwell.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the Cross, in Tone II:
О Christ God my Savior, Who saved Peter in the sea, save me by the power of
the Cross, and have mercy on me.
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
Those who ever enjoyed Thy gifts cried out, “Crucify Him!”; those who slew
the righteous ones asked that a malefactor be given to them in place of the
Benefactor. But Thou didst keep silence, О Christ, enduring their savagery, desiring to suffer and thus save us, in that Thou lovest mankind.
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: The choirs of the martyrs opposed the tyrants, saying: “We
fight for the King of hosts! And even if ye have subjected us to fire and tortures,
we will not reject the power of the Trinity!”
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Spec. Mel.: “When from the Tree ...”:
Stavrotheotokion: Having endured many pangs during the crucifixion of thy
Son and God, * O most pure one, * thou didst groan, weeping and crying aloud: *
“Woe is me, O my sweet Child! * How is it that thou sufferest unjustly, * desiring
to deliver the mortal descendents of Adam?” * Wherefore, O most pure Virgin, *
we entreat thee with faith: ** Render Him merciful unto us!
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.
TUESDAY NIGHT: TONE II

Canon of Supplication to the Most Holy Theotokos
ODE I
Irmos: Come, O ye people, * let us sing a song to Christ our God, * Who
divided the sea, * and made a way for the nation * which He had brought
up out of the bondage of Egypt; * for He hath been glorified.
The discourse granted me is in nowise capable of hymnody, О all-pure one,
for the darkness of my sins doth cover me; yet accept my limitations, О Birthgiver
of God.
I finally flee from my countless sins to thy protection, О most pure one.
Render our God and Master easily reconciled with me, and save me, О pure one.
Glory ..., Thou art my fervent mercy-seat, Lady, and, fleeing to thee, I am
saved and obtain salvation of soul; for thou canst do all things, in that thou art the
Mother of the God of all.
Now & ever ..., The deceiver of souls hath lured me into the pit of
destruction; but stretch forth to me thy mighty hand, О Virgin Theotokos, and
quickly lead me up to the light.
ODE III
Irmos: O Lord, who didst slay sin upon the tree, * firmly establish us in
Thee, * and in the hearts of us who hymn Thee * plant the fear of Thee.
Having fallen among many thieves, wretch that I am, I have been stripped
naked, wounded and left for dead; but disdain me not, О pure Theotokos.
The serpent who wrought deception through the tree stripped Adam naked,
and hath now easily made my soul captive. Yet I entreat thee, О Lady: Have pity
on me!
Glory ..., I now bring my secret deeds before thee, my true intercessor and
protection, that thy Son may not denounce me with them at His righteous
judgment.
Now & ever ..., Have mercy, О pure one, have mercy, for we derive no
salvation from our deeds. Wherefore, with ardent faith we cry out to thee: Have
mercy upon thy servants!
ODE IV
Irmos: I hymn Thee, O Lord, for I have heard report of Thee, * and I was
afraid; * for Thou comest to me, seeking me who am lost. * Wherefore, I
glorify Thy great condescension towards me, * O greatly Merciful One. 
Disdain me not who am incurably ill and infirm, О Lady; but grant unto me
the oil of thy goodness, О Virgin, and enrich me with thoughts of thee, as with
incorruptible gold from God.
I have been stripped bare of all good works and lie arrayed in evils more than
all who fell of old; but do thou now adorn me with good deeds and deliver me
from wickedness, О Bride of God.
Glory ..., In word and with my will, I have surpassed the harlot in fornication
and the publican in usury; yet before the end grant that I may acquire the
repentance of both, О Lady.
Now & ever ..., I have dwelt in the desert of grief and have withdrawn from
thee, О Birthgiver of God. Who shall give me wings, that I may fly and go to thee,
my hope, who dost save me from faintheartedness, wretch that I am?
ODE V
Irmos: O Lord, Bestower of light and Creator of the ages: * guide us in the
light of Thy commandments, * for we know none other God than Thee.
In that the never-waning Light shone forth from thy womb upon those on
earth, О Lady, illumine my fetid soul, and drive all darkness from my heart, О
pure one.
The cruel night of my wicked and evil deeds covereth me, O Lady; yet I cry
out to thee: Guide me to the divine light of thy Son and Master, О all-hymned
one.
Glory ..., О pure one, accept me as thy Son, the Creator of all, accepted the
prodigal son, for I cry out with him: I have truly sinned! Save me, О Lady!
Now & ever ..., In that thou art merciful, О most pure one, heal thou my
heart, which hath been wounded by the assaults of the evil one, for thou hast
ineffably given birth to Him Who was wounded in the flesh upon the Cross.
ODE VI
Irmos: Whirled about in the abyss of sin, * I appeal to the unfathomable
abyss of Thy compassion: * Raise me up from corruption, O God.
I have fallen into the pit of sin and, held fast by fear, I cannot lift my gaze to
our unforgettable God; yet I cast myself down before thee, О Bride of God.
By thine omnipotent supplication, О Virgin Theotokos, pilot my heart, which
hath been grievously covered by the waves of mine incomprehensible
transgressions.
Glory ..., In that thou art my confirmation, О Lady, grant that I may behold
the beauty of thy glory when my soul shall be separated from my flesh, that I may
thus know remission.
Now & ever ..., By thy prayers to God deliver thy servants, who have recourse
to thee with faith, from perils, misfortunes and sorrows, О holy Lady.
Lord, have mercy, (Thrice).
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Sessional hymn, in Tone II:
We magnify thee, O Theotokos, crying aloud: * Thou art the un-burnt bush, *
wherein Moses beheld as a flame ** the Fire of the Divinity.
ODE VII
Irmos: When the golden image was worshipped on the plain of Dura, * Thy
three children spurned the impious command, * and, cast into the midst of
the flame, * they were bedewed, and sang: * O God of our fathers, Blessed
art Thou!
Gaping wide, the enemy now strives to devour me, for from every quarter he
brings temptations and snares to bear upon me, wholly cutting off my progress;
yet anticipating my need, О Virgin Mother, deliver me from his wicked assaults.
The adversary defiles and vexes my senses and mind, striving to drag me down
into the pit of despair; wherefore, I cry out to thee alone: О Bride of God, my
refuge, deliver me from the hands of the evil one!
Glory ..., О my Christ Who art Thyself the Word, Who of old delivered the
three youths from the furnace, by the supplications of Thy Mother who knew not
wedlock, bedew me and deliver me from the flame which I have enkindled by my
boundless evil deeds.
Now & ever ..., Coming upon my material heart, the corrupter hath slain it;
but by thy divine power cause rain to fall upon me, О Mother who knewest not
wedlock, and grant that I may vanquish him, that I may cry out to thee with faith:
Blessed art thou who hast given birth to God in the flesh.
ODE VIII
Irmos: God Who descended into the fiery furnace * with the Hebrew
children, * and transformed the flame into dew, * do ye works hymn, * and
supremely exalt as Lord throughout all ages.
Cruelly buried beneath my many evils and weighed down by the multitude of
sins, I dare not in anywise lift up mine eyes to heaven, but cry out to thee: Have
mercy upon me who have fallen, О only Theotokos!
I have fallen under the wrath of thy Son and God, О pure one. Deliver me,
and in the hour when He shall conduct the trial, be thou my helper, О most pure
one, and deliver me from standing with the goats on the left side.
Glory ..., О Maiden Bride of God, raise me up who have been spiritually slain
by my countless sins, and by thy supplication deliver me from all the deception of
the soul-corrupting enemy and murderer.
Now & ever ..., How hast thou besmirched thy pristine beauty with evil, О my
incorrigible and wicked soul? How hast thou broken all thy promises to thy
Creator and accepted evils? Yet go thou and hasten with piety to the Theotokos.
ODE IX
Irmos: God the Word, God of God, * Who by ineffable wisdom came to
create Adam anew * after his grievous fall to corruption through eating *
and Who took flesh beyond all telling from the Holy Virgin for our sake, *
Him we faithful with one accord magnify in song.
I have truly defiled my senses with grievous actions and am wholly filled with
shameful deeds; but cleanse me, О most pure one, asking that I be granted time
for goodly compunction, that I may unceasingly magnify thee.
When the hidden deeds of everyone shall be revealed, О Theotokos, be my
justification, since thou truly hast the power to do so, and deliver me from
darkness, that by thy prayers I may dwell in the land of light, where there is
ineffable joy.
Glory ..., I beseech Thee, О Word: Before Thy final coming grant me fervent
repentance, tearful compunction, chastity and humility, divine love, and a place in
Thy flock, through the prayers of her who gave birth to Thee.
Now & ever ..., О Virgin who dost surpass all noetic and material beings in
glory and honor, except for God, disdain me not who have surpassed in
transgressions all people, past and present, who have sinned on the earth; and by
thy prayer save me.
Then, “It is truly meet ...,” and prostration. Trisagion through Our Father ..., And
the rest as usual. Dismissal.

cry aloud: Glory be to Thee, О Lord!
Verse: Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship the footstool of His feet, *
for He is holy.
Just as the enemy made Adam captive by the fruit of the tree, so didst Thou
Thyself make the enemy captive by the tree of the Cross and Thy suffering, О

mankind.
Verse: God is our King before the ages; * He hath wrought salvation in the
midst of the earth.

Lover of mankind.

To the Martyrs: О Christ God Who, in that Thou art good, hast made Thy
saints shine more brightly than gold and hast glorified Thy holy ones: Entreated
by them grant peace to our lives, in that Thou lovest mankind, and set their
supplication before Thee like incense, О Thou Who alone restest in the saints.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: Beholding Thee, O Christ, stretched dead upon the tree, *

shameful death upon the Cross?

Spec. Mel.: “As the wellspring of loving-kindness ...”:
For our sake Thou didst endure crucifixion and death, О Jesus, Bestower of
life, that in the multitude of Thy compassions Thou mightest deliver the creation
of Thy hands from condemnation to death, in that Thou art the compassionate
God and Lover of mankind, and alone art sinless.
Like the thief do I confess and cry out to Thee, O Good One: Remember me,
О Lord, in Thy kingdom! Reckon me with him, О Thou Who didst willingly
accept sufferings for our sake.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: Guarded by the precious Cross of thy son, * O pure Lady

rightly call thee blessed, * for thou art the mother of light ** and the only hope of
our souls!
Canon to the precious & life-creating Cross of the Lord, the acrostic
whereof is: ‘'The setting up of the Cross is the fall of the demons”, the
composition of Joseph, in Tone II:
ODE I
Irmos: In the deep of old the infinite Power overwhelmed Pharaoh's whole
army. * But the Incarnate Word annihilated pernicious sin. * Exceedingly
glorious is the Lord, * for gloriously hath He been glorified.
Of old, through the tree death befell the first-formed man, when he broke the
first commandment; but the Immortal One, Who was lifted up upon the Tree and
tasted death, hath given immortality to all mankind.
When the Cross was planted in the earth the arrogance of the enemy fell and
was thus destroyed; and man, who before was cast out, entereth again into
paradise. Glory be to Thee, our only God, Whose good pleasure this was!
To the Martyrs: Slaughtered like lambs, as reason-endowed sheep, your
members pitilessly severed, О all-praised martyrs, ye offered yourselves as sheep
unto Him Who was slain, and now illumine the Holy Church of the firstborn.
To the Martyrs: Ever making a mighty stand, О wise ones, hewn down by the
sword and cast into fire and water, ye brought low the wicked enemy; wherefore,
ye were deemed worthy to receive a good end, О passion-bearers.
Theotokion: The sacred choir of the prophets called thee the impassable gate,
the chosen land and the unquarried mountain, О most pure Lady; for thou hast
given birth to the Master of all, Who of His own will deigned to be crucified in
the flesh.
Another canon, of the Most Holy Theotokos, in Tone II:
Irmos: Come, O ye people, * let us sing a song to Christ our God, * Who
divided the sea, * and made a way for the nation * which He had brought
up out of the bondage of Egypt; * for He hath been glorified.
Come, all ye faithful, and together let us chant unto the Theotokos; for she
gave birth to Christ in a manner transcending all human understanding, and
unceasingly prayeth that He save us all.
He Who is the image of the Hypostasis of the Father took on matter from
thee, О Birthgiver of God, and hath glorified our corrupted nature and restored it.
As one higher in honor than the cherubim, thou hast exceeded the circles of
heaven; for in a manner transcending understanding thou didst contain God
within thy womb without suffering.
Thou hast given birth unto the Lord and Benefactor, the deliverance from our
sins, changing the mortality of our forefather Adam, and lifting up our nature to
the heavens.
ODE III
Canon of the Cross
Irmos: The desert of the barren Church of the nations * blossomed like a
lily * at Thy coming, O Lord, * therein hath my heart been established.

condescension, О Word.

Thee, * and in the hearts of us who hymn Thee * plant the fear of Thee.

mountain of God and the divine and beauteous palace.
In that thou art the temple and sacred dwelling-place of the Word, О most
pure and Ever-virgin Theotokos, be thou for me the cleansing offenses.
Neither the tongue of mortals nor the mind of the incorporeal beings are able
to describe thy birthgiving, О Theotokos, for thou hast given birth to the Creator
in a manner transcending nature and comprehension.
О Virgin Birthgiver of God, be thou the confirmation and refuge of those
who have recourse unto thee with faith and declare thee to be the Mother of God.
ODE IV
Canon of the Cross
Irmos: From a Virgin didst Thou come forth, not as an ambassador, * nor
as an Angel, * but the very Lord himself incarnate, * and didst save me, the
whole man; * wherefore I cry unto Thee: * Glory to Thy power, O Lord!
When Thou wast lifted up upon the Tree Thou didst abolish the rule of the
cruel prince of this world, annulling the curse. Wherefore, saved by Thee, О only
Lord, we glorify Thee.
Beholding Thee stretched out upon the Tree, the sun hid its light, the
mountains and rocks split asunder, and the veil of the temple was rent in twain, О

Rain down upon me drops of compunction, О Lady, removing all corruption
from my heart and staunching the turbid torrents of my mind.
О most pure one, disdain me not who have been stabbed by the sword of
pleasures and lie wounded; and heal me with the spear and Blood of thy crucified
Son and our God.
О all-immaculate one, who hast been enriched by dominion over all creation,
with divine grace have pity on me who have been sorely impoverished, that I may
magnify thee as my good intercessor.
Cool me with repentance, О Virgin, and send down rain to bedew my heart,
which hath dried up under the burning heat of the passions, pouring out upon me
the oil and healing of thy mercy.
ODE V
Canon of the Cross
Irmos: O Christ God Thou art a mediator between God and man; * for by
Thee, O Master, * we have been led from the night of ignorance, * to Thy
Father, the Source of light.
Nailed to the Cross, Thou didst shake the foundations of the earth; and
pierced by the spear, Thou didst slay the serpent, the author of evil, pouring forth
streams of salvation upon all, О Christ.

hands be lost and slain, wherefore Thou didst stretch out Thy hands upon the

exeedingly adorned vessels of the Spirit, wise passion-bearers: ye are worthily

having finished their race, as martyrs, they received crowns.

Irmos: O Lord, Bestower of light and Creator of the ages: * guide us in the
light of Thy commandments, * for we know none other God than Thee.

born, incarnate, from thee without seed: true God and man by nature. Wherefore,
we glorify thee.
Ever fleeing with faith beneath thy protection and help, О most pure Virgin,
because of thee we are delivered from every grievous circumstance.
Deliver us from temptations, from the tempest of thoughts, from all wrath and
every sin, from famine and plague, and from everlasting torment, О most pure
Virgin.
As thou art our intercessor, salvation and the hope of Christians, О Lady, save
those who ever hymn thee with faith and love, О all-hymned Virgin.

Canon of the Cross

up from the abyss of Hades, I pray Thee; * for with a voice of praise as to
my Redeemer, * in the spirit of truth * I offer myself to Thee.”

Cross on which Thou, О Word, didst stretch out Thy hands; and Thou didst

abyss of Thy compassion: * Raise me up from corruption, O God.
He Who of His own will created all things deigned to make His abode within
the womb of her who knew not wedlock; and, in that He is full of lovingkindness, He enriched with incorruption those Sick with corruption.
О most immaculate One, who art more exalted and holy than the hosts on
high, in a supra-natural manner thou didst contain within thy womb the
uncontainable Word.
О Lady, guide me who have strayed from the path of life unto the ways of
repentance, for I often wander lost amid the trackless wilderness of sin.
Disdain not the entreaties of us, thy servants, who place our hope in thee, О
pure one; for thou art the refuge and cleansing of the souls of all, О Lady.

but Christ bedewed the God-fearing children with the Spirit, * therefore He

mankind, О Virgin; wherefore, by thy supplications deliver me who have been
defiled by the passions and made corrupt by the wiles of the enemy.
The furnace, О all-immaculate one, prefigured thy birthgiving; for the

everlasting fire.
ODE VIII
Canon of the Cross
Irmos: In Babylon, the activity of the fire was once divided, * for, by the
command of God it consumed the Chaldeans, * but bedewed the faithful,
who chant: * Bless ye the Lord, all ye works of the Lord!
By the blood which flowed from Thine incorrupt side creation hath been
sanctified, О Long-suffering One, the rivers of polytheism have been dried up,

the faithful, ever healing the ill affects of all but incurable diseases; for “Wondrous

beasts, the boiling of cauldrons, freezing cold and ice, the burden of the heat of
day, and violent death; wherefore, ye are glorified with Christ.

ye works of the Lord!
О pure one, from thy virginal womb thou hast given birth to the living Water,
and poured forth remission upon the faithful from thy well-spring of healings;
wherefore, we all cry aloud: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord!
Thou gavest rise to the ripe Grapes of life, О pure one; for thou art the vine
which sweeteneth the earth with good things, and hymning thee, we cry aloud:
Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord!
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX
Canon of the Cross
Irmos: The Son of the Beginningless Father, God and Lord, * hath
appeared to us incarnate of a Virgin, * to enlighten those in darkness, * and
to gather the dispersed; * therefore the all-hymned Theotokos do we
magnify
By Thy wounds mend my broken and contrite state, О unfathomable Word,
and by Thy suffering, О Lord God of my salvation, cleanse mine image, which
hath been buried under wicked passions.
In Thy goodness Thou wast seen to be uplifted upon the cypress, the pine and
the cedar, that Thou mightest save mankind, О Master, Who art One of the Holy
Trinity, possessed of a single Hypostasis in two natures.
To the Martyrs: Armed with the Cross as with a shield, О martyrs, ye were
shown to be unharmed by all the arrows of the author of evil; wherefore, ye now
trample him underfoot, ever mocking him as a bird of ill omen.
To the Martyrs: Gaping wide, the earth received your blood, but heaven
received your divine spirits, and ye stand before the throne of God with the fiery
ranks, О passion-bearing martyrs, unshakable pillars of the Church.
Theotokion: Having supra-naturally given birth to the Author of all creation,
yet remaining a virgin, thou didst restore the corrupted nature of our first father.
And, beholding Him suspended on the Cross of old, thou didst cry aloud in
exclamation, О most pure Virgin Mother.
Canon of the Theotokos
Irmos: The Son of the Beginningless Father ...,
Grant unto me the love of God for all, О Maiden, who alone ineffably gave
birth unto God the Lover of mankind, and Who assumed flesh from thee. And
from the flame which is to come, and from all torment deliver me who glorify
thee with love. (Twice)
Having acquired thee alone as a sure intercessor, our hope, bulwark and trust,
steadfast protection, an unassailable foundation, a haven safe from storms, and a
mighty refuge, О all-hymned one, we are all saved.
О Maiden who hast given birth to the divine Light, enlighten my heart, which
hath been darkened by the many assaults of the passions and the plots of the alien 
one, and ever let fall upon me the drops which cleanse me from the defilements
of sin, О Virgin.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the Cross, in Tone II:
О Christ God, Thou hast shown the tree of Thy Cross to be a tree of life for
us who believe on Thee; and thereby Thou hast abolished the dominion of death
and brought life unto us who have been slain by sin. Wherefore, we cry out to
Thee: О Lord, Benefactor of all, glory be to Thee!
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
Having willingly impoverished Thyself for the sake of Adam’s poverty, О
Christ God, Thou didst come to earth and became incarnate from the Virgin, and
accepted crucifixion, that Thou mightest free us from slavery to the enemy. Glory
be to Thee, О Lord!
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: Every city and land honoreth your relics, О passion-bearers
and martyrs; for, having contended lawfully, ye have received heavenly crowns:
wherefore, ye are the boast of hierarchs and the majesty of the Churches.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Spec. Mel.: “When from the Tree ...”:
Stavrotheotokion: Upon beholding the ripe Cluster, * Whom thou didst bear
in thy womb without being tilled, * hanging upon the Tree, O pure one, * thou
didst exclaim lamenting and crying aloud: * 'I beseech Thee O my Child, * pour
forth that sweetness * by which the drunkenness of the passions is taken away, *
for my sake, O Benefactor, ** who didst bear Thee in Thy tender compassion!
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.

ON WEDNESDAY MORNING: TONE II
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone II:
We offer Thee the cry of the thief, and we pray: In Thy kingdom have mercy
upon us, О Savior!
When Thou wast lifted up upon the Cross, О Savior, Thou didst lift human
nature up with Thyself, and it unceasingly hymneth Thee.
With Thy spear Thou didst rend asunder the record of Adam’s sin, entering
him in the book of the living, О Lover of mankind.
To the Martyrs: As emulators of Him Who endured crucifixion, О martyrs, ye
were shown to share also in His glory.
Glory ..., Let the beginningless Father, the Son Who is equally without
beginning, and the Holy Spirit, be hymned in one worship and glory.
Now & ever ..., When thou didst behold on the Cross the One to Whom thou
hadst given birth without seed, О Maiden, weeping, thou didst hymn His longsuffering.
On Wednesday, the Prokeimenon in Tone III:
Prokeimenon, the Hymn of the Theotokos, in Tone III: My soul doth
