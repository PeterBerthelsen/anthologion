having traversed them dryshod * chanted unto Thee a hymn of victory.
With waters flowing with life, О Virgin, give drink to my soul which withereth
away under the burning heat of sin, that I may produce the fruitful grain of godly
compunction.
Rain down upon me drops of compunction, О pure Maiden, and with drops
of compassion wash away all the defilement of my soul which hath come upon it
through inattention.
Glory ..., Having taken thy Creator into thy womb, thou hast given birth unto
Him without seed, and God became an infant. О strange wonder! Thou art both a
handmaiden and mother, О Lady unwedded!
Now & ever ..., О most pure Virgin Mother, thou hast given birth for us to
Christ, the Redeemer of the race of mankind, our Liberator and Savior; wherefore,
knowing thee to clearly be the mediatress of eternal life, we glorify thee.
ODE III
Irmos: O Lord and Savior, * Who in the beginning established the heavens
* by Thine all-powerful Word , * and by the divine and all-accomplishing
Spirit * hath granted them all their strength, * do Thou establish me on the

Having dyed a purple robe - His body - in thy most pure blood, and put it on
without assuming the corruption of nature, the King of all issued forth from thee
as both God and man, О Virgin, possessed of immutable royalty.
As a treasury of good and ineffable things given by God unto all, О Virgin,

thee amid perils, misfortunes and infirmities.

whereon the Word was writ by the finger of the Father, О pure one; wherefore,
pray that He inscribe me in the Book of Life, rending asunder the evil record of
my sins.

earth O Christ God, * I have heard of the mystery of Thy dispensation, *
and I have glorified Thee, * O only Lover of mankind.
Entreat Him Who was born from thee, О Theotokos, that we who glorify His

one, hath filled all things with sweet fragrance through divine understanding, and
dispelling the fetor of falsehood.

unto thee: Be thou my cleansing, О thou who hast given birth to Him Who taketh
away the transgressions of the world!

God: * grant me the forgiveness of my sins, * and guide my steps to the

have been submerged by sins, * and cast to the soul-corrupting beast, *
wherefore like Jonah I cry to Thee, O Christ: * Lead me up from the deadly
abyss.
By thy seedless birthgiving, О Theotokos, have we been delivered from the
corruption of death and the sin of Adam; for thy Son, Who alone is both God and
man, granteth to the faithful deliverance from offenses.
Rend asunder the record of my transgressions, О Lady, through thy divine
supplications recording me in the Book of the Saved, that in praise I may hymn
thee, who art more holy than the cherubim.
Glory ..., They who of old were cast from before Thy face by Thy righteous
judgment, О Christ, hast Thou recalled by Thine advent in the flesh, in that Thou
art full of tender compassion. And now, О Good One, accept us who have
committed offense, and free us from evils.
Now & ever ..., О most pure Virgin, I entreat thee who hast given birth to the
Benefactor and Cleansing of sinners: By thy maternal supplication cleanse the guilt
of my countless transgressions, for thou hast the power so to do, as the Mother of

My mind, which is weighed down by sin, О all-immaculate one, do thou rouse
unto good works, that I may bless thee who art more honorable than all creation.
In the furnace the three young children prefigured thy birthgiving, for thou
wast not consumed when thou didst give birth to Fire, О pure one; wherefore,
consume now the tinder-like passions of my heart.
Glory ..., Perceiving thee to be beauteous and comely among women, the Lord
became incarnate from thee; wherefore, entreat Him, О most holy Maiden, that

sin; wherefore, I beseech thee: Bedew my soul which hath withered also.

speech and stammering, * and revealed God unto him; * and zeal for God
showed forth the three Children who chanted hymns * to be unvanquished
by the fire. * O all ye His works, praise ye the Lord * and supremely exalt
Him throughout all ages.
The bush which burned, yet was not consumed, and with which Moses the
God-seer conversed with on Sinai, showed forth thy strange birthgiving,
wherefore, marveling at this, О pure one, he cried aloud, rejoicing: Hymn the
Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and supremely exalt Him throughout the ages!

supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!
Now & ever ..., Moved by His love for mankind, in that He is good, thy Son,
О Theotokos, hath given thee as a help against the enemy and the healing of
sufferings of those who cry: Hymn the Lord, all ye works of the Lord, and
supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!
ODE IX
Irmos: Conceiving without knowing corruption, * and lending thy flesh to
the Word, * O Mother unwedded and Virgin Theotokos, * thou art the
vessel of the Uncircumscribable One, * and dwelling place of thy Creator, *
thee do we magnify.
Having nourished as an infant Him Who as Creator sustaineth and sanctifieth
the whole world, thou hast been revealed to be the Mother of the Almighty
according to the flesh, the irremovable riches of virginity, О Virgin Theotokos,
thou Bride who knewest not a man.
Having given birth to the Word Who exceedingly loveth manking and taketh
away the sin of the world, О Virgin, entreat Him to send down the remission of
sins upon us who with unwavering faith bless thee as is meet.
Glory ..., Enamored of sin, I tremble in fear lest I suddenly reach the end of
my life, О pure Lady, intercessor of all the oppressed. Wherefore, be thou now
entreated, that thou strengthen me by examples of repentance.
Now & ever ..., Let me not be sent into the fire prepared for me, О most
Compassionate and greatly Merciful One, for the Virgin who gave birth to Thee,
together with the divine choir of the incorporeal hosts, the apostles, prophets,
martyrs and holy hierarchs, and the souls of the righteous, ever beseech Thee.

God, that He grant peace to the world and save our souls.
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
О apostles of Christ, husbandmen of the Savior, bearing the Cross upon your
shoulders as a plough, and having cleared the earth made hard by the delusion of
idolatry, ye sowed the word of faith, and are therefore fittingly honored, О holy
apostles of Christ.
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: Breathing forth one thing only, and looking toward one thing
alone, the passion-bearing martyrs, having found the one path of life, which is
death for Christ, urged one another on to death. О the wonder! For, snatching up
the treasures of torment, they said to each other: If we die not now, we shall die in
any case; wherefore, let us do things worthy of life: let us do what needs be done
with love of honor, that we may sell what we have and purchase life with death!”
By their prayers, О God, have mercy on us.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Thou wast ineffably born from the Virgin, О Christ, enlightening those in
darkness, who cry aloud: Glory be to Thee, О Lord!
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.

On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone VII:
Comely and good to taste was the fruit which brought death upon me. But
Christ is the Tree of life, and eating thereof I die not, but cry out with the thief:
Remember me in Thy kingdom, О Lord!
From the depths of false belief did ye draw flocks of the nations unto the
divinely beauteous Faith, О most wise and glorious apostles, bringing them to the
noetic banquet as a priceless gift.
Driving the darkness of grievous beguilement away with the light of preaching,
О apostles of the Lord, ye manifestly illumined the hearts of the pious; wherefore,
we bless you with divine hymns.
To the Martyrs: While your members were being severed with the sword, О
divine spiritual athletes, ye were not cut off from the love of the Redeemer, but
hastened to Him. And now ye all live in joy, illumined with heavenly glory.
Glory ..., The most malignant corrupter of the race of mankind besets me. О
omnipotent Trinity, snatch me from his jaws by the prayers of Thy preachers, that
I may magnify Thine infinite mercy.
Now & ever ..., О pure Virgin, thou didst bring forth the Son, bearing mortal
flesh from thy pure blood, Who is co-enthroned with the Father, that He might
render human nature immortal; wherefore, we all bless thee as is meet.
