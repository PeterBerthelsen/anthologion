MONDAY EVENING: TONE II
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 stichera of repentance, in Tone II:
Spec. Mel.: “When from the Tree ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
О Christ, Who alone art without sin. * Who alone art without guile, * Who
alone art the Wellspring of goodness: * Behold mine oppression, behold my
tribulation. * Wash all the wounds of my stripes, * and in Thy mercy save Thy
servant, * that, having driven the clouds of slothfulness far from me, * I may
glorify Thee, ** my supremely good Savior.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
Look, О my lowly soul! * Behold thy works, which are all-defiled! * Behold thy
nakedness * and, alas, thine isolation! * For thou shalt be separated from God
and the angels, * and cast into endless torment. * Come to thy senses, arise, make
haste and cry aloud: * I have sinned, О Savior! ** Grant me forgiveness, and save
me!
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
I have grievously defiled my body * and brought corruption upon my soul and
heart * by my vile thoughts; * I have wounded all my senses, and blinded mine
eyes, * have stopped up mine ears with filth, * and have defiled my tongue; and all
that I have is shameful. * Wherefore, falling down before Thee, I cry aloud: * О
Master Christ, I have sinned against Thee! ** I have sinned; forgive and save me!
Then the Stichera of the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera of the Forerunner, in the same melody:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
Hasten thou, I pray thee, * and rescue me from temptations, * О glorious
Forerunner of the Lord; * for the bitter demons who wage war on me, * vainly
hurl themselves against me, * seeking to capture the soul of thy servant like a
helpless bird. * Leave me not utterly alone, О all-blessed one, * but let them
understand ** that thou art my refuge.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
О all-holy offspring of a barren woman, * wondrous scion of the desert, *
beauteous swallow, * right melodious nightingale, * golden dove: * Ever show
forth my wretched soul * to be fruitful in good works, * that, bearing grain an
hundredfold, О blessed one, ** it may bring divine praise unto thee.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
Deliver me I pray thee, О Forerunner; * from everlasting fire, * from the
darkness which is utterly devoid of light, * from necessity and tribulation, * from
all affliction, and all oppression, * and by thy supplications show unto me, * who
am condemned by my transgressions, * the portion of the saved, ** where the
delight and joy of the saints is ineffable, О good one.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Tribulation, cruel assaults, and divers passions * bestorm my lowly soul, * О
Maiden who knewest not wedlock, * Mother of Christ God. * Show thyself to be
my pilot on the sea of life, * and still the tempest that assails me, * steering me to
the calm harbors * of repentance and coolness, ** for I have made recourse to thy
divine protection.
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone IV:
Prokeimenon: The Lord will hearken unto me * when I cry unto Him.
Verse: When I called upon Thee, O God of my righteousness, Thou didst
hearken unto me.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of compunction, in Tone II:
Like the prodigal son I have sinned against Thee, О Savior. Accept me who
am penitent, О Father. Have mercy upon me, О God!
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
With the cry of the publican I cry out to Thee, О Christ my Savior: Cleanse me
as Thou didst him, and have mercy on me, О God!
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: When the holy martyrs pray for us and hymn Christ, all
delusion ceaseth, and the race of mankind is saved by faith.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
All of my hope do I place on thee, * O Mother of God; ** keep me under thy
protection.

Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

Thy radiance, * for I know no other God than Thee.

revealed Himself as a man; and thou hast become more exalted than the
cherubim.

everlasting torment, and in repentance cry aloud, weeping: I have sinned, О God!
Have mercy on me!
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.
Testing my condemned conscience, I am in fear of Thy dread tribunal, О
Lord; for in me there are no works of salvation. Yet as Thou art possessed of a
wealth of loving-kindness, О Christ God, have pity on me, and save me.

We magnify thee, O Theotokos, crying aloud: * Thou art the un-burnt bush, *

The Sessional hymns of compunction, in Tone II:
“Have mercy on me,” said David; and I cry unto Thee: “I have sinned, О
Savior! Cleanse me of my sins through repentance, and have mercy on me!”
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.
“Have mercy on me, О God, have mercy on me!”, David wept over his two
sins; and I cry out to Thee over my tens of thousands of transgressions; he made
his bed moist with tears, but I shed nary a one. Wherefore, I am in despair, and
pray: “Have mercy on me, О God, according to Thy great mercy!”
Verse: Wondrous is God in His saints, * the God of Israel.
To the Martyrs: О Christ God Who, in that Thou art good, hast made Thy
saints to shine with greater luster than gold, and hast glorified Thy holy ones,
entreated by them grant peace to our lives, in that Thou lovest mankind, and set
their prayer before Thee like incense, О Thou Who alone restest in the saints.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O Theotokos turn not away from me * who am in need of thy help! * for my
soul trusteth in thee: ** do thou have mercy upon me!
After the 3rd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone II:
Spec. Mel.: “As the wellspring of loving-kindness ...”:
In the streams of the Jordan thou didst immerse the abundant Wellspring of
loving-kindness, О John; wherefore, I earnestly beseech thee: Guide me by thy
right acceptable prayers to the haven of life, for every day I am cruelly engulfed by
many passions and the abyss of life.
In the tender compassion of Thy mercy, О Good Christ, Thou didst come to
save Thy creature, bowing down the heavens in Thy condescension; wherefore,
hymning Thine awesome dispensation, we cry unto Thee: By the prayers of Thy
forerunner, grant us cleansing of sins, in that Thou alone art full of lovingkindness.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Who hath seen, who hath heard of a mother giving birth to her own Creator,
without knowing a man, and giving suck unto Him Who gives nourishment to all
flesh? О the wonder! Thy womb hath been revealed to be the throne of the
cherubim, О gracious Theotokos. Pray for our souls.
Canon of repentance, to our Lord Jesus Christ and the holy martyrs, the
acrostic whereof is: “Thou accedest to my lamentations, О Savior”, the
composition of Joseph, in Tone II:
ODE I
Irmos: Taking up the Song of Moses, O my soul, * cry aloud: * 'A helper
and a protector hath become unto me salvation. * My God, * whom I will
glorify'.
Before our departure let us weep bitterly, О brethren, that by goodly tears we,
who are devoid of anything that is profitable, may avoid torment at that time.
Ten thousands of times I vowed to repent, О Christ, but my soul is numb, and
I fall into transgressions. Have pity on my weakness, О Savior.
To the Martyrs: О passion-bearers of Christ, who endured the fire of torment,
with divine dew deliver from the fire of Gehenna, me who wallow in grievous
passions.
To the Martyrs: Shown to be mighty in divine power over the enemy, О right
praiseworthy martyrs of Christ, ye cast down their feeble force.
Theotokion: О fire-bearing tongs, which Isaiah once beheld, burn up the base
passions of my heart, and destroy them utterly, О Birthgiver of God.
Another canon, of the holy and most honorable prophet, John the
Forerunner, the acrostic whereof is “O Baptist, accept this entreaty”, the
composition of Joseph, in Tone II:
Irmos: The Lord mighty in battle * uncovered the foundation of the deep *
and led His servants on dry ground; * but He covered their adversaries with
the waters, * for He hath been glorified.
O Baptist and Forerunner of Christ, pilot my mind, which is ever
overwhelmed by bodily pleasures, and still the waves of the passions, that I may
hymn thee in divine serenity.
Illumined with inconceivable enlightenment, like a star of great radiance thou
didst go forth before the noetic Dawn. Thereby, О Baptist, I pray: Let my heart
be enlightened, for it hath been darkened by the assaults of demons.
In the river, О most wise one, thou didst once immerse the Abyss Who by
grace hath brought about the drowning of all transgression. And I pray, О blessed
one: By thy divine mediation dry up the torrents of my sins.
Theotokion: Thou wast the kinsman of the pure Virgin who gave flesh unto
God; and we who now dwell in thy divine temple honor thee with her, and we
pray: Make us also temples of the Holy Spirit.
ODE III
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: My mind hath not brought forth good fruit, * but do Thou show me
to be fruitful * in Thy compassion O God, * Thou husbandman of all good
things.
I have weighed my soul down with the slumber of slothfulness. But rouse me,
О Christ unto the wakefulness of repentance, that I may do Thy commandments.
Let me not be seen as desperate on the dread day, О Jesus, but, converting me
before the end, deliver me from cruel torments.
To the Martyrs: О passion-bearers of Christ, who emulated well His
sufferings, heal the grievous passions of my soul.
To the Martyrs: That ye might be deemed worthy of eternal good things in the
heavens, О passion-bearers, ye steadfastly endured every trial of the cruel ones
here on earth.
Theotokion: As a mother thou givest suck to the Nourisher of all, and in thine
arms didst bear Him Who ever holdeth all things in His hand.
Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: Thou hast established me on the rock of faith, * and my mouth hath
been emboldened against mine enemies. * For my spirit rejoiceth when I
sing: * There is none as holy as our God * and none more righteous than
Thee, O Lord.
Heal the stripes of my soul, О Forerunner of the Lord, and with thy divine
mediation illumine my mind, which hath been obscured by indifference; and
deliver me from every machination of the adversary, I pray.
Born in accordance with the providence of God, О most wise prophet, thou
didst free thy mother from barrenness; wherefore, by thy prayers make my barren
heart now fruitful, О Forerunner of the Lord, that it may put forth the virtues as
shoots.
In thy love pray that those who with faith serve thy temple may receive the
heavenly life of Him Who createth the divine abodes; and by thy prayers, О
Baptist and Forerunner, make them temples of the divine Spirit.
Theotokion: Carried in the womb of thy mother, О Forerunner, thou didst
rejoice and pay homage to the Lord, Who was borne in the womb of her who is
full of grace. Him do thou entreat, that He deliver me from all tribulation.
ODE IV
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: The prophet foreseeing Thy birth from a virgin, * prophesied crying
aloud: * ‘I have heard report of Thee, and I was afraid; * For from the
South, from the Overshadowed mountain * shalt thou come forth O Christ’
Seeing me everywhere robbed and reduced to penury, the enemy, the crafty
deceiver, rejoices, О Word. But deliver me from his wickedness, О Lord of glory,
and Enrichment of the poor.
I have defiled my hands and eyes, having done those things which I ought not
to have done, О Lord; and I have turned Thy compassions to wrath, squandering
Thy longsuffering. But look down, О Good One, and have pity on me.
To the Martyrs: How wondrous is our God in the saints who heeded Him,
who overturned the graven images unto their destruction, and have inherited the
broad expanse of paradise, from whence Adam was expelled of old.
To the Martyrs: With the streams of your blood, О blessed ones, ye put an end
to the blood once offered to the demons, which was the destructive ruination for
all those who offered it up in sacrifice; wherefore, ye are ever called blessed.
Theotokion: Taught by the Spirit, in sacred images and divers ways the most
glorious choir of the prophets depicted beforehand the mystery of thee, which
passeth understanding, О Theotokos, the end whereof we splendidly behold.
Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: From a Virgin didst Thou come forth, not as an ambassador, * nor
as an Angel, * but the very Lord himself incarnate, * and didst save me, the
whole man; * wherefore I cry unto Thee: * Glory to Thy power, O Lord!
With thy right hand, thou didst bow the head of Him Who bowed down the
heavens and conversed with us, О thou who art most noetically rich. Preserve me
also thereby, maintaining my heart in humility.
The trackless desert had thee dwelling within it, О blessed Forerunner;
wherefore, I cry unto thee: Keep safe my soul, which is devoid of any divine
activity.
Observing the law of God, thou wast iniquitously slain; wherefore, I pray to
thee: Set me aright, who ever commit iniquity and am led astray by the delusions
of the demons.
Having made thyself a temple for the King and Master, О Forerunner, thou
hast now passed over to the divine habitations. Pray thou that those who have
raised up a divine house unto thee may receive it.

free me from my grievous and nigh incurable passions, that I may magnify thee
who hast magnified all humanity.
ODE V
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: Having dispelled the gloom of my soul, * O my Savior, do Thou
illumine me * with the light of Thy commandments * for Thou alone art
the King of peace.
Mindlessly I heap sins upon sins, and there can be no uplifting in my death.
Woe is me! How shall I appear before Christ?
Misfortune hath smitten me like a ship, and I have cast overboard the freight
Thou gavest me, О Compassionate One; and, now impoverished, I cry: Disdain
me not, О Christ!
To the Martyrs: Having disdained base glory as worthy to be trampled
underfoot, О passion-bearers, abiding with Christ ye have been deemed worthy of
the glory of heaven.
To the Martyrs: Having cut your mind off from the love of the flesh, О
passion-bearers, with faith ye lovingly embraced tortures, becoming Christ’s.

mountain from whence the Stone was quarried Who crusheth the graven images
of the demons.
Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: O Christ my Savior, the enlightenment of those lying in the darkness
of sin. * I rise early to hymn Thee O King of Peace, * enlighten me with
Thy radiance, * for I know no other God than Thee.
О Forerunner, who baptized Christ, the Stream of incorruption, in the torrents
of the Jordan: Beseech Him to dry up the stench of my passions, that I may
inherit torrents of sweetness and the beautiful joy of the righteous.
Already I lament, and am constrained by fear, and am ever perplexed,
contemplating the things I have done and the terrible judgment which is to come.
О compassionate Lord, have pity on me, by the prayers of Thy Forerunner.
О Forerunner, who didst tell the people that the law of salvation lieth in
repentance for their transgressions, thou didst stand before the law and grace;
wherefore, we entreat thee: Enlighten us with examples of repentance.
Grant unto me the time to repent, for I have wasted all the time given me
despondently, О Benefactor and Word, in that Thou hast John, the great
Forerunner and universal preacher of repentance, entreating Thee for this.
Theotokion: I have been slain by the assaults and pursuit of the deceiver, О
all-immaculate Lady. Enliven me, О Theotokos who hast given birth to the
hypostatic Life of all, that with piety I may hymn thee, the all-immaculate one.
ODE VI
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: I am held fast in the depths of sin O Savior, * and am overwhelmed
by the sea of life, * but as Jonah was delivered from the sea-monster, * so
also deliver me from the passions, * and save me.
Like the Canaanite woman of old I cry unto Thee: О Son of God, have mercy
and pity on me! For my soul suffereth in its grievous deeds, and desireth not to
come to its senses.
The tempest of countless passions vexeth me. As once Thou didst rebuke the
sea and save Thy holy disciples, О Jesus Christ, so raise me up and save me.
To the Martyrs: The incorporeal angelic choirs marveled at your bodily
endurance, О honored spiritual athletes, and they praised Him Who granteth you
power and the reward for your toils.
To the Martyrs: Soaked by the streams of your own blood, your eyes plucked
out, chilled by the perishing cold, О martyrs, ye passed over to the warmth of life,
hymning Christ.
Theotokion: Like a table, О all-hymned one, thou didst hold the mystical
Bread, of Whom those who eat will no longer hunger, knowing thee to be truly
the Mother and Nourisher of Christ, the God of all.
Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: Whirled about in the abyss of sin, * I appeal to the unfathomable
abyss of Thy compassion: * Raise me up from corruption, O God.
О voice who proclaimed the Word, accepting the cries of us all, ask that He
grant forgiveness of sins unto those who hymn Him with faith.
Heal the broken state of my soul, loose the burden of my sins, and by thy
supplications save me who am beyond hope, О blessed Forerunner.
Entreat Jesus, Whom thou didst baptize with thy hand, О most glorious
Forerunner, that from the hand of sin He deliver me who ever lift up my hands
unto Him.

weigheth heavily upon my heart. But by thy vigilant mediation raise me up, О
most pure one, and save me.

Canon of Repentance
Irmos: Like unto the Cherubim, the Children rejoicing in the furnace sang:
* 'Blessed art Thou O God, * for in truth Thou hast brought this judgment
upon us * because of our sins, * Thou art supremely praised and glorified
throughout all ages'.
I have rejected Thy laws and made myself subject to irrational lusts, doing
unseemly things, О Christ, for I have become vain in my mindlessness more than
any other men on earth. But in Thy loving-kindness leave me not to perish, О
Savior.
Behold, I have been conceived in iniquities, О Lord: like David I cry out, like
the harlot I weep, for like an offensive servant I have offended Thee, the only
good God. But in Thy tender compassion leave me not to perish, О Savior.
To the Martyrs: The martyric assembly of the passion-bearers struggled and
were crowned as martyrs by the life-bearing right hand of God; for they truly
loved God, Who created all things by His word. And rejoicing now in the
heavens, they enjoy a divine inheritance.
To the Martyrs: Their eyes plucked out, their hands and feet severed, the right
glorious ones ran right speedily to the heavenly course, treading on the feet of the
one enemy. By their supplications, О Word, save all who glorify Thee.
Theotokion: The cherubim, the seraphim, the thrones, authorities and
dominions ever glorify and hymn thy birthgiving, which transcends
understanding, О all-hymned Mary, for thou alone hast given birth to God in the
flesh. Him do thou entreat, О pure one, that we who honor thee with love may be
saved.
Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: The godless order of the lawless tyrant * fanned the roaring flame; *
but Christ bedewed the God-fearing children with the Spirit, * therefore He
is blessed and supremely exalted.
Having hewn down the wounds of my passion-plagued heart with thine axe of
repentance, О Forerunner, plant in their stead divine dispassion and the most
pure fear of God, which remove me from all evil.
As thou didst baptize in the streams of the Jordan the Lord Who covereth His
chambers with the waters, beseech Him ever to give the water of divine
compunction to mine eyes, О glorious Forerunner.
Having preached the Lamb of God, Who taketh away the sin of the world, О
glorious Forerunner, beseech Him to deliver me from the lot of the goats, and to
number me among the lambs at His right hand.

the Word incarnate, Whom the great Forerunner, rejoicing, acknowledged with
godly leaps as the all-holy and seedless Fruit, bowing down before Him.
ODE VIII
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: Unto Him Who of old prefigured the miracle of the Virgin, * unto
Moses in the burning bush * on Mount Sinai, * let us sing, bless and
supremely exult throughout all ages.
That Thou mightest deify us, in Thy mercy Thou didst become incarnate. This
I have failed to understood, slave that I am to pleasures. But in Thy goodness
convert me, О Christ, Thou salvation of all.
О Word, good Shepherd, turn Thou and save my wretched soul, which hath
become lost in the mountains of transgression, and let not the deceiving foe
utterly slay me.
To the Martyrs: “Let us stand manfully together!” the comely spiritual athletes
cried one to another as they were cruelly wounded. “Behold, Christ extendeth
crowns of victory to us throughout all ages!”
To the Martyrs: With your mighty pangs, as with strong cords, ye choked the
serpent who desired to deceive you with evil machinations; and ye have been
revealed to be inheritors of the food of paradise.
Theotokion: That God might deify us, He took flesh from thy pure blood and
became a man, О Virgin Theotokos. Him do thou ever entreat on behalf of those
who honor thee.
Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: In Babylon, the activity of the fire was once divided, * for, by the
command of God it consumed the Chaldeans, * but bedewed the faithful,
who chant: * Bless ye the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! 
Extend thy right hand unto me who lie on the ground, О Forerunner who,
extending thy right hand, didst wash the Undefiled One in the waters. Deliver me
from bodily corruption, cleansing me wholly with repentance; and save me.
As thou hast time to repent, О my soul, shake off the heavy sleep of
slothfulness, and hasten to keep watch, crying out to thy Master:
Have pity on me, О Thou Who art full of loving-kindness, by the prayers of
him who baptized Thee.
The torrents of the passions and the waters of evil have entered in unto my
soul, О blessed Forerunner. Hasten thou to quickly rescue me, О thou who in the
river’s streams washed the most tranquil Deep of dispassion.
Alas for me who have done much evil! Woe is me, who alone have angered the
supremely good God! О thou who didst baptize Christ, help me, and by thy
mediations grant me the remission of my transgressions and the annulment of my
debts.
Theotokion: О thou who gavest. birth in the flesh unto the Most High God,
raise me up from the mire of the passions which sorely trouble me, О most pure
one, and enrich me with divine virtues, for I am grievously and wholly
impoverished, that, saved, I may hymn thee.
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: Who born on Earth hath ever heard of, or beheld, * a Virgin
miraculously conceiving in her womb, * and painlessly giving birth to a
child, * wherefore we magnify thee O pure Virgin.
О how awesome is the tribunal at which I shall await judgment, О Christ; yet I
in nowise feel terror thereof, spending all my time in idleness. But convert me, О
only Creator, Who converted the sinful Manasseh.
Staunch the torrents of my boundless evils, I cry unto Thee, О Christ, granting
me outpourings of tears which wash away the defilement in which I wallowed in
mine insanity; and in Thy mercy save me, О Thou Who didst save the harlot who
repented with all her soul.
To the Martyrs: Shining forth upon us like the sun, the splendid memory of
the divine passion-bearers sheddeth light upon all the ends of the earth, and with
the divine Spirit dispels the gloom of the madness of idolatry and the darkness of
the soul-corrupting passions.
To the Martyrs: The honored regiment, the victorious army, the chosen
company, the assembly of the holy martyrs, the divine choir have united
themselves to the choirs of the incorporeal ones. By their prayers, О Christ, grant
us all to share in Thy kingdom.
Theotokion: With the radiant effulgence of Him Who shone forth upon us
from thy womb, destroying the night of ungodliness, О Mary, Virgin Mother,
enlighten all who honor thee with faith; and at the hour of condemnation, deliver
them from the darkness which is devoid of light.
Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: The beginningless Son of God the Father and the Lord, * became
flesh from the Virgin, * to give light to those in darkness, * and to gather
the dispersed. * Wherefore we magnify the all-hymned Theotokos!
Deliver me from the mire of sin, О only sinless and greatly merciful Lord,
through the prayers of the Baptist who proclaimed Thee, the Lamb of God, to the
whole world, as He Who taketh away the sins of all.
Having thee as a fragrant rose, as a right redolent cypress tree, as a neverfading lily, as precious myrrh, О Forerunner of the Lord, running to thy
protection I am delivered from the stench of my deeds by thy supplications.
О all-blessed one, make me who have become barren through my fruitless
deeds, ever fruitful in the virtues, and a child of the Lord, a sharer in the divine
kingdom and a dweller with the council of the saints.
From heaven grant remission of evils, correction of life and deliverance from
transgressions unto us who love thee, who honor thee with love and join chorus
in thy divine temple, О Forerunner of the Lord.
Theotokion: Thou didst pay homage unto Him Who was borne in the womb
of the Mother of God and holdeth all things in His hand, О prophet. With her
pray that my lowly soul may be saved, for every day it falleth into many offenses.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of compunction, in Tone II:
I have surpassed all in sin! From whom shall I learn repentance? If I sigh like
the publican, I only burden the heavens; if I weep like the harlot, I defile the earth
with my tears. But grant me remission of sins, О God, and have mercy on me.
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
Overlook mine iniquities, О Lord Who wast born from the Virgin; and purify
my heart, making it a temple for Thy Holy Spirit. Turn not Thy face away from
me, О Thou Who art possessed of great and boundless mercy.
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
Taking up the Cross of Christ as a trophy of victory, О holy martyrs, ye set at
naught all the power of the devil; and receiving heavenly crowns, ye have become
bulwarks for us, praying to the Lord on our behalf.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Rejoice, O Theotokos Mary, * thou indestructible and surpassingly holy
temple; * as the prophet crieth out: ** Holy is thy temple, wondrous in
righteousness!
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON TUESDAY MORNING: TONE II
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone II:
We offer Thee the cry of the thief, and we pray: In Thy kingdom have mercy
upon us, О Savior!
I have surpassed the thief and the harlot in my passions. О Savior, have pity
on me who am self-condemned!
О Forerunner who immersed the Abyss of loving-kindness in the waters, by
thy supplications decrease my passions.
To the Martyrs: О passion-bearers of Christ, who dried up the torrents of
deception with the torrents of your blood, ye are glorified as is meet.
Glory ..., As it is written, even the rhetorical mind of man is unable to hymn
the one Principle of the Godhead in three Hypostases.
Now & ever ..., With songs of praise let us all unceasingly hymn her who,
without being consumed, gave birth to the beginningless God.
On Tuesday, the Prokeimenon in Tone VII:
Prokeimenon, in Tone VII: The righteous man shall be glad in the Lord *
and shall hope in Him.
Verse: Hearken, O God, unto my prayer, when I make supplication unto Thee.
Alleluia, in Tone IV: The righteous man shall flourish like a palm tree, and
like a cedar in Lebanon shall he be multiplied.
Verse: They that are planted in the house of the Lord, in the courts of our
God they shall blossom forth.
Communion Verse: In everlasting remembrance shall the righteous be; he
shall not be afraid of evil tidings.
