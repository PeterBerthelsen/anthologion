ON FRIDAY EVENING: TONE VIII
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of the martyrs, in Tone VIII:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
O martyrs of the Lord, ye sanctify every place and heal every manner of
infirmities: and now we entreat you to intercede on our behalf, that our souls may
be delivered from the snares of the enemy.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
Thy martyrs, O Lord, no longer mindful of the temporal things of this life,
despised not torture for the sake of the life to come, which they manifestly
inherited, wherefore they rejoice with the angels. By their supplications grant great
mercy to Thy people.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
What virtue, what praise, are due the saints? For they bowed their heads
beneath the sword for the sake of Thee Who bowed down the heavens and
descended to us; they shed their blood for Thee Who abased Thyself and assumed
the form of a servant; they humbled themselves even unto death, imitating Thy
poverty. By their intercessions, О God, have mercy on us, in the multitude of Thy
compassions!
Then the Stichera for the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera prosomoia, in the same tone:
Spec. Mel.: “O most glorious wonder ...”:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
I have become like the barren tree, as if clad with useless leaves; and I am
afraid that if I am cut down, Thou wilt send me into unquenchable everlasting
fire, О Master. But grant me time to convert, that I may offer Thee the goodly
fruit of virtuous acts, and may be deemed worthy of Thy kingdom.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
O Lord, О Lord, Who lovest mankind, turn not Thy face away from me, Thy
servant, who angereth Thy goodness every day, neither punish me by Thy
righteous wrath, О Christ. I confess that I have sinned, I have sinned against Thee
like none other. But have pity and save me, by the prayers of Thy Mother.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
When in Thy glory Thou shalt sit as the King of all upon Thy judgment-seat,
and all the holy angels stand before Thee with fear, and all human nature will
stand before Thee to be judged, О Christ; then, through the supplications of Thy
Mother, О Lord, from all torments deliver those who have fallen asleep in faith.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Dogmatic Theotokion:
In His love for mankind, the King of heaven appeared on earth * and dwelt
among men; * for He Who received flesh from the pure Virgin * and cameth
forth from her having received human nature, * is the only Son of God, * twofold
in nature but not Hypostasis. * Therefore, proclaiming Him to be truly perfect
God and perfect man, * we confess Christ our God. * Him do thou beseech, O
unwedded Mother, ** that our souls find mercy!
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone VII:
Prokeimenon: O God, my helper art Thou, * and Thy mercy shall go
before me.
Verse: Rescue me from mine enemies, O God, and from them that rise up
against me redeem me.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, these Stichera, in Tone VIII:
O ye martyrs of the Lord, we beseech you to intercede before our God: pray
ye that abundant mercy be granted to our souls, and the cleansing of our many
sins.
Verse: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, О
Lord.
I weep and lament when I contemplate death and behold our beauty, which
hath been created according to the image of God, lying in the grave, bereft of
form, devoid of glory, unsightly. О the wonder! What is this mystery concerning
us? How have we been given over to corruption? How have we been yoked
together with death? Truly, as it is written, this is by the command of God, Who
giveth rest unto the departed.
Verse: Their souls * shall dwell among good things.
Thy death, О Lord, won immortality for us; for if Thou hadst not been laid in
the tomb, paradise would not have been opened. Wherefore, grant rest to the
departed, in that Thou lovest mankind.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O pure Virgin, portal of the Word, Mother of our God: pray thou that we be
saved.
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

flames, * changing the fire into dew, they cried aloud: * 'Blessed art Thou,
O Lord our God, throughout the ages'.
