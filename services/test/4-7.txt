FRIDAY EVENING: TONE IV
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, these Stichera of the Saints, in Tone IV:
Spec. Mel.: “Thou hast given a sign... ”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
Emulating the sufferings of Christ, the Lover of mankind, О passion-bearers,
ye gave your bodies over to wounds, and bitter torments, and innumerable pangs,
ever looking forward to the divine delight of paradise, to ever-abundant
sustenance and everlasting glory; and having received this, ye pray for those who
hymn you.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
Repeat: Emulating the sufferings of Christ ...,
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
О most sacred pastors, as glorious emulators of Christ, the Chief Shepherd,
the King of all, ye readily laid down your lives for the sheep, and endured grievous
misfortunes, О right blessed ones; and as champions ye save the divinely chosen
flock unharmed by cruel wolves.
Then, these other Stichera, of the martyrs, in the same melody:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
O ye martyrs of the Lord, living sacrifices, noetic burnt-offerings, perfect
offerings to God, lambs who knew God and are known by Him, whose fold no
wolf can enter: Pray ye that with you we may also feed beside the waters of rest.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
Precious is the death of Thy saints, O Lord. Slain by the sword, and by fire
and freezing cold, they poured forth their blood, placing all their hope in Thee
that from Thy hand they would receive the reward of their labors. They endured
to the end and received from Thee O Savior, Thy great mercy.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
O saints, since ye have boldness in the presence of the Savior, unceasingly
entreat Him for us sinners, asking that remission of sins, and great mercy, be
granted to our souls.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Dogmatic Theotokion:
Prophet David, the ancestor of God, * spoke of thee in psalmody unto Him
who hath accomplished great things in thee. * For God was well pleased without
father to become a man from thee, * the Queen who standeth at His right hand, *
and He - the source of life - showed thee to be His mother, * that he might renew
his own image, corrupted by the passions. * Having found the lost sheep
wandering on the mountain * He hath laid it upon his shoulders, * that he may
bring it to his Father; * and in accordance with his own will * unite it to the
heavenly Powers * and thus, O Theotokos, save the world, ** Christ, who is richly
and abundantly merciful.
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone VII:
Prokeimenon: O God, my helper art Thou, * and Thy mercy shall go
before me.
Verse: Rescue me from mine enemies, O God, and from them that rise up
against me redeem me.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, these Stichera, in Tone IV:
To the Martyrs: Thou art glorified in the memorials of Thy saints, O Christ
our God; by their intercessions send down upon us great mercy.
Verse: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, О
Lord.
To the Martyrs: O Thou Who hast accepted the patient endurance of the holy
martyrs; in Thy love for mankind do Thou accept our hymns of praise, and by
their intercessions send down upon us great mercy.
Verse: Their souls * shall dwell among good things.
For the reposed: With the souls of the righteous who have reposed, O Savior,
grant rest to the souls of Thy departed servants, preserving them in the life of
blessedness which is in Thee, O Lover of mankind.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O thou inextinguishable lamp, * and throne of righteousness * most pure
Sovereign Lady: ** pray thou that our souls be saved.

Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

mighty strongholds of the warriors, * that in the mortality of my flesh * as
on a timbrel * I may chant a hymn of victory.
From the mire of the passions, from the threefold billows of wicked thoughts,
from the darts of the evil one, and from, every assault of the adversary, deliver my
wretched soul, О most pure Birthgiver of God, and rescue me from everlasting

soul, break asunder the bonds of sin, and save me by thine assistance, I pray.

thou make steadfast in the most pure fear of God, О most immaculate Virgin, by

wholly darkened by the gloom of the passions, and am enslaved to sin; and join
me to thy Son and our God.
In that thou hast given birth to Life, О most immaculate one, give life to me
who have been slain by the malice of the deceiver; for to thee have I fled. Lead me
up who have been engulfed by abysmal falls, in that thou art merciful, О allimmaculate one.

despondency and slothfulness. Yet, О good one who hast given birth to the

by thy supplications.

with all my heart, dispelling the ignorance of my heart, О all-immaculate one.
Glory ..., Keep thou my soul as the apple of thine eye under the shelter of thy
wings, О good and most pure one, and deliver it from the oppression and tyranny
of the evil spirits.
Now & ever ..., О most pure one, thou hast appeared, delivering from the
assaults of the passions and the evil demons thy servant who hath acquired thee as
a mighty ally and unashamed intercessor.
ODE VI
Irmos: Prefiguring Thy three-day burial * Prophet Jonah praying in the
belly of the sea-monster cried aloud: * Deliver me from corruption * O
Jesus Thou King of hosts.
Cast down those who ever wage war upon me, О Lady, and dispel the clouds
of mine evil thoughts, О Mother of God who art the portal of the Sun of
righteousness.
Shine upon me the radiance of repentance, О Lady, and break through the
clouds of mine evil thoughts, for I have been attracted and corrupted by grievous
corruption.
Glory ..., Still thou the raging billows of my passions and quell the storm of
mine evil thoughts, О most immaculate one, thou steadfast intercessor and
protection of all.

save me before the end.
Lord, have mercy, (Thrice).

deliver me from the flame of torment and everlasting darkness.

transgressions, and deliver me, I pray, from all restraint at the hour of mine end.

compassions, О pure Virgin, quench thou the furnace which the multitude of
mine evils have prepared for me through the activity of the demons.

О thou who alone art the Ever-virgin Mother of the Word, do thou deliver us
who truly hymn thee with understanding throughout all ages.

children * in the midst of the flame, * Thou didst teach them to sing: * All
ye works bless and hymn the Lord.
Heal thou my ailing soul, О Theotokos, Virgin Bride of God; illumine my
darkened mind, and rescue me from fire and the indescribable and everlasting
torments.
Bent beneath the weight of irrational passions, I have fallen into the abyss of
destruction and have made myself fuel for the flame; yet do thou deliver me, thy
servant, from thence, О Virgin Theotokos.
Glory ..., Dry up the depths of mine evils, О thou who hast given birth to the
Abyss of loving-kindness, the Redeemer and Lord, and before the end loose thou
the bonds of mine evils, О thou who hast given birth to the Savior of all.
Now & ever ..., The Lord Who became incarnate through thy womb, He Who
hath dominion over all creation, showed thee, О Virgin, to be the Sovereign Lady
who reigns over all creatures, visible and invisible, glorifying thee as His
immaculate Mother.
ODE IX
Irmos: Eve dwelt under the curse of sin * because of the infirmity of
disobedience; * but thou, O Virgin Theotokos, * hast through the
Offspring of thy pregnancy * blossomed forth blessing upon the world. *
Wherefore, we all magnify thee.
My heart, which is barren of divine virtues, О most pure Virgin Theotokos, do
thou show forth as fruitful, in that thou wast born from a barren woman at the
command of, and by the will of, Him Who transformeth all things: that I may
hymn thee, the all-hymned one.
With thy light illumine me, О most immaculate one, for thou hast given birth
to the unapproachable Light; burn away the clouds of my passions, rescue me
from the darkness devoid of light, and grant unto me divine light, that I may
hymn thee, О Virgin Mother.
Glory ..., With the sprinkling of thy compassions, О pure one, cleanse my
putrid heart, and grant that I may ever shed my tears in streams, and cutting off
the torrents of the passions, may I be delivered from torment.
Now & ever ..., O right loving Theotokos who hast given birth to the right
loving God, do thou now quickly free me from wicked carnal love, that I, who am
perishing through slothfulness, may serve the will of God, О Lady.

their offenses, О Thou only abundantly merciful Lord.
Theotokion: О all-immaculate one who wast revealed to be more exalted than
the cherubim, in that thou hast given birth to the Sustainer of all things, elevate
my mind, strengthening me against the carnal passions, that I may do the will of
the Master.
Canon of the Departed
Irmos: Same as the foregoing.
Refrain: Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel.
Unto true martyrs and spiritual athletes Thou hast given the boldness to
entreat Thee, О Lord. For their sake give divine deliverance unto those who have
reposed, in faith, granting them to dwell in a place of holy habitation.
Refrain: Grant rest, О Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants.
О Thou Who by Thine all-creative hand dost work all things for the good,
Who hast authority over the living and dominion over the dead: In that Thou art
almighty, settle by peaceful waters Thy servants whom Thou hast taken to
Thyself.
Glory ..., О Thou Who by nature art good, Who art rich in mercies and
goodness, deliver from the outermost darkness those who call upon Thy name,
justifying them by faith and grace, and enlightening them, in that Thou lovest
mankind.
Theotokion: The prophets proclaimed the images of thy birthgiving, О allimmaculate one, and others have composed yet other titles for thee, for thou hast
given birth unto the Life of those in Hades, Who destroyeth the might of death.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Praises, these Stichera of the martyrs, in Tone IV:
Verse: Praise Him for His mighty acts, * praise Him according to the
multitude of His greatness.
Who is not filled with wonder, O holy martyrs, at beholding the good fight
that ye have fought? For armed with the Cross and in the body confessing Christ,
ye defeated the bodiless adversary; wherefore, as is meet, ye have been shown to
be expellers of demons, and opponents of the barbarians, ever interceding that
our souls be saved.
Verse: Praise Him with the sound of trumpet, * praise Him with the
psaltery and harp.
O holy martyrs, ye have become companions of the angels, bravely preaching
Christ at the tribunal; for having forsaken all the beautiful things of this world, as
though they did not exist, ye held fast to the faith as your steadfast hope.
Wherefore, putting deception to flight, ye pour forth gifts of healing upon the
faithful, ever interceding that our souls be saved.
Verse: Praise Him with timbrel and dance, * praise him with strings and
flute.
How shall we not marvel at your struggles, O holy martyrs? For, clothed in
mortal bodies, ye vanquished the incorporeal enemies; the threats of tyrants
roused no fear in you; neither did the infliction of tortures, fill you with fear.
Therefore, as is meet, ye have been truly glorified by Christ, ask ye great mercy for
our souls.
Verse: Praise Him with tuneful cymbals, praise Him with cymbals of
jubilation. * Let every breath praise the Lord.
Precious is the death of Thy saints, O Lord. Slain by the sword, and by fire
and freezing cold, they poured forth their blood, placing all their hope in Thee
that from Thy hand they would receive the reward of their labors. They endured
to the end and received from Thee O Savior, Thy great mercy.
For the reposed: In a place of rest with Thee, O Lord, where all Thy saints
repose, grant rest to Thy servants, for Thou alone art the Lover of mankind.
Glory ...,
Where is the passionate attraction of the world? Where is the illusion of
transitory things? Where is the gold and silver? Where are the multitude of
servants and their clamor? All is dust, all is ashes, all is but a shadow. Come ye,
and let us cry aloud to Christ Who is immortal: О Lord, grant Thine eternal good
things unto those who have departed from us, granting them rest in Thy
blessedness which waxeth not old.
Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
О only pure and most pure Virgin, who hast given birth without seed unto
God: Pray thou that our souls be saved.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the departed, in Tone IV:
Spec. Mel.: “Thou hast given a sign ...”:
Truly awesome is the mystery of death. How the soul is separated from the
body, and this harmony and union is broken, and severed by the will of God.
Wherefore we entreat Thee: In the dwellings of Thy righteous grant rest to those
who have departed unto Thee, О Bestower of life, and Lover of mankind.
Verse: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, O
Lord.
For those who believe in Thee, death is but a dream; for when Thou, the
Master of all, wast laid in the tomb, Thou didst destroy the power of death,
abolishing its ancient dominion. Wherefore we entreat Thee: Those who have
departed unto Thee do Thou grant to dwell in the joy of Thy saints and the
splendor of the just..
Verse: Their souls * shall dwell among good things.
Thou hast become our righteousness and sanctification, and the redemption
of our souls. For Thou didst lead us justified and redeemed unto the Father,
taking upon Thyself the punishment and debt due from us. And now we entreat
Thee: Grant rest to the departed in the joy and radiance of Thy saints, O our
Benefactor and Lover of mankind.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Theotokion: Following, the words of the divinely eloquent prophets, O allimmaculate One, we believe thee to be the Theotokos. For thou didst ineffably
give birth to God in the flesh, Who hath delivered us from the bondage of sin.
Ever beseech Him, that He illumine thy departed servants with the radiance of
His Light.
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON SATURDAY MORNING: TONE IV
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone IV:
Of old Adam was banished From paradise through the tree, but by the tree of
the Cross the thief hath come to dwell in paradise: the one by tasting rejected the
commandment of the Creator, but the other, crucified with Christ, confessed the
hidden God, crying out: Remember me in Thy kingdom!
Afire with the love of Christ, О holy martyrs, with the dew of your struggles ye
quenched the fire of ungodliness; and ye were shown to be greatly radiant lamps
of the Church, driving the darkness of infirmities and tribulations from our souls
by your goodness; wherefore, we praise you as is meet.
О sacred hierarchs, ye divine company of the prophets, ye choir of the
venerable, ye sole procession of holy women, who pleased God with virtuous acts
and have been glorified: We bless you, praying through your supplications, that we
may receive enlightenment and life everlasting.
For the reposed: Where Thy light shineth, and where the choirs of the saints
rejoice, whence sighing and pain have fled, do Thou number Thy servants, who
have reposed in times past and departed this most painful life, О Christ, that they
may hymn Thine ineffable goodness; and overlook the transgressions they
committed on earth.
Glory ..., О indivisible Trinity, Who art worshipped in the Father, the Son and
the Spirit, О Unity of three Hypostases, united in every way though with
uncommingled characteristics: By the supplications of Thy holy martyrs, the
fathers and the honorable prophets, grant rest unto those who have died in the
Faith, and grant purification to their souls.
Now & ever ..., Thou didst conceive the Word Whom the Father begot before
the morning-star, and hast given birth, to Him in the flesh as a perfect man,
known in two activities and wills, О most pure one. Wherefore, entreat Him as
the Creator and Lord, that He have pity on us who hymn thee, О Maiden Bride of
God.
