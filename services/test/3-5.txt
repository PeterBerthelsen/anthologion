redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
Wretch that I am, I have been wounded by the sting of the serpent and lie
downcast, dead, bereft of breath. But by thy vigilant supplications do thou quickly
raise me up, О all-blessed hierarch, that I may glorify thy speedily attentive grace.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.

deceitful mind in nowise ceaseth his pursuit of me; but, in that Thou art God,
have pity and save me, by the prayers of Nicholas.

the Lord abideth forever.

deception of the idols, and preaching the knowledge of God. Behold, your
struggle is good, О blessed ones; wherefore, we hymn and glorify your memory.

heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
As branches of the life-bearing Vine, О glorious apostles, ye brought
yourselves to God as the fruit of piety; wherefore, as ye have boldness before
Him, ask that He grant peace and great mercy to our souls.
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we

reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: Rendered steadfast by faith, strengthened by hope, and
spiritually united by the love of Thy Cross, О Lord, Thy martyrs abolished the
tyranny of the enemy; and having received crowns, with the incorporeal ones they

supremely glorious, * to Him alone let us sing, for He hath been glorified.
О Theotokos, grant me contrition and spiritual tears, that I may weep for my
many transgressions and my failure to correct my conscience. О Maiden, I entreat
thy loving-kindness.
Stumbling over my thoughts, I fall headlong into the abyss of destruction. О
Virgin, I now entreat thy help: set thou unshakably the weakness of my mind
upon the firm rock of the commandments of God.
Glory ..., I bear the barrenness of the fig tree, and fear felling and disputation,
lest my Creator and God send me into the fire. О Lady, anticipating my needs,
render me fruitful in works of repentance, that I may glorify thee.

thou art the immaculate temple of the King, with chastity and a pure life cleanse

grace.
ODE III
Irmos: O Most High, Ruler of all, * who out of nothing hath established all
things, * fashioned by Thy Word, * perfected by the Spirit, * confirm me in
Thy love.
Many are they who war against me and afflict me, and I can find no ease of
deliverance from those who beset me; yet disdain not my prayer, О pure one.
Weighed down by a multitude of evils and my manifold transgressions, I am
unable to lift up mine eyes to the heights of heaven; yet do thou grant me
remission, О most pure one.
Glory ..., All my days the evil serpent strives to destroy my lowly soul; yet do
thou break his soul-destroying fangs, О Theotokos.

me, thy servant, and from tempests of sin, and by thy supplications direct me to
the haven of salvation.
ODE IV
Irmos: Thou hast shown us steadfast love, O Lord, * for Thou gavest Thine
only-begotten Son over to death for our sake. * Wherefore with
thanksgiving we cry unto Thee, * ‘Glory to Thy power, O Lord!’
I tremble, considering the depths of my sins and the grievous and great billows
of mine adverse thoughts; yet do thou direct and pilot me to the calm haven, О
most pure one.
Grievous ignorance, incomprehension and the heedlessness of mine evils have
now come upon my soul; yet do thou, О most pure one, lead me to repentance
for those things which I have done.
Glory ..., With streams of tears extinguish the fire of the passions and with the
fire of the Spirit bum up the thorns and billows of life which choke my mind, О
Birthgiver of God, for thou art my protection and boast.
Now & ever ..., I am wholly engulfed by the tumult and threefold billows of
perils and evil thoughts, and ever dragged down into the abyss of despair, I cry to
thee: О Lady, save me, thy servant!
ODE V
Irmos: In a vision Isaiah saw upon a throne, * God lifted up on high *
borne aloft by angels of glory; * and he cried: ‘Woe is me! * For I have
foreseen God made flesh, * the Lord of the never-setting light * and the
King of peace.’
Thou knowest the pain of my soul, the weakness of my flesh and the
corruption and inconstancy of my mind, О Lady. Wherefore, grant me thy mercy
and grace, that, saved by thy protection, I may glorify thee.
Deny me not thy loving-kindness and compassion, О all-immaculate Lady; but
grant thy mercies, and the release and forgiveness of mine evil deeds to me who
approach thee in compunction, that I may hymn thy mighty acts with
thanksgiving.
Glory ..., Those who hate me in vain and oppress me have now increased in
number more than the hairs of my head, О pure Virgin, seeking to destroy me and
make of me food for them to devour; wherefore, turn them back, filling them
with shame.
Now & ever ..., О pure Virgin who hast given peace to the world and salvation
unto all, having given birth to divine Peace, with the peace and love of Christ the
Savior quell thou the battle of the passions against my soul and body.
ODE VI
Irmos: The uttermost depths of sin have surrounded me, * and my spirit
perisheth. * but do Thou, O Master, stretch forth Thy lofty arm * and like
Peter O Helmsman, * do Thou save me.
There is no one on earth who lives as wickedly as I do in deed, word and
action. Wherefore, О Lady, I beg thee to grant me the mercies of thy love for
mankind.
Actions of evil transgression beget grief for all; wherefore, we are now beset by
bitter perils. Help us, О thou who alone art the salvation of Christians!
Glory ..., Thou hast given birth, yet hast remained pure after birthgiving, О
Virgin Theotokos; wherefore, do thou ever entreat thine Offspring, that we, thy
servants, may be delivered from all the harm of the enemy.

I have passed my whole life in great slothfulness, О most pure one, and have
now drawn nigh unto my departure from this time; and I am afraid of mine
enemies, lest they destroy my soul, О all-immaculate one, and cast me into the
abyss of destruction. Yet take pity on thy servant, О Virgin, and deliver me from
their affliction.
ODE VII
Irmos: As of old Thou didst bedew * the three pious children in the
Chaldean flames, * so also with the radiant fire of Thy divinity * illumine us
who cry to Thee, * ‘Blessed art Thou, the God of our fathers!’
Defiled in body and soul, and sullied by mine unclean acts, I beseech thee, the
pure and immaculate Mother of God, О Lady, trusting in thy mercy: Have pity on
me, О most pure one!
The multitude of my transgressions and temptation of evils fill me greatly with
perplexity and drag me down into the abyss of despondency; but do thou, О most
pure Lady, save me who am perishing and cruelly drowning.
Glory ..., In the magnitude of the compassions of thy goodness, О Good One,
overlook the multitude of our sins, and be thou well disposed toward those who
cry out unceasingly: Blessed art Thou, О Lord God of our fathers!

depths of sorrows and the perils of life do thou draw toward dispassion and
gladsome joy us who cry: Thou alone art full of the grace of God!
ODE VIII
Irmos: The flame of material fire withered * through the immaterial flame
brought about by the god-seeing children, * wherefore they chanted: *
Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord!
The bitterness of pleasures, overcoming all the senses of my body, doth foully
sully my soul, drawing me toward death. О Sovereign Lady of the world, be thou
my salvation!
To thee have I entrusted soul, heart and body, for I have no other help than
thee, О Lady, through whom I obtain mercy; wherefore, grant me thy rich mercy
and grace.
Glory ..., Poisoning me with his venom, the serpent hath grievously slain my
wretched soul with bodily death; yet bring it to life again, using thy supplications

peace, beseech Him, that He quickly bestow peace upon the world, that we may
glorify Him in peace.

ON THURSDAY MORNING: TONE III
AT MATINS
After the 1st chanting of the Psalter,
the Sessional hymns of the apostles, in Tone III:
Come ye all, and let us praise the apostles as helmsmen; for they abolished the
delusion of the idols, led us up to the light of life, and taught us to believe in the
Trinity. Wherefore, celebrating their honored memory today, О ye faithful, we
glorify Christ our God.
Verse: Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth, * and their words
unto the end of the world.
In that Thou art almighty, О Lord, Thou didst make brilliant the memorial of
Thine apostles, for Thou didst strengthen them to emulate Thy sufferings, and
they manfully vanquished the power of the enemy; wherefore, they have received
the grace of healing. By their prayers grant peace to Thy people, О Lover of
mankind.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
О Theotokos, thou didst mystically contain within thy womb the
Unapproachable and Uncircumscribable One, Who is of the same essence as the

to understand the Godhead of the Trinity to be single and uncommingled.
Wherefore, in thanksgiving we cry out to thee: Rejoice, О joyous one!
After the 2nd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone III:
Ye irrigated all the earth with streams of the divine Word, О apostles, and

After the 3rd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone III:
In that Thou art full of loving-kindness, О Christ, Thou didst launch Thine
apostles toward the ends of the earth like arrows keenly sharpened, to slay all
ungodliness and evil vanity, and to plant the doctrines of salvation. At their
supplications, О Compassionate One, grant peace to our souls.
Praising thee, the preacher of the Truth and most radiant beacon of the world,
О Nicholas, we chant and cry aloud, praying with faith: As thou didst rescue the
innocent from death, О holy one, so deliver us also from misfortunes, tribulations
and all grievous affliction.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
As thou hast maternal boldness before thy Son, О all-immaculate Lady,
enliven my soul, which hath been slain by many offenses; for thou alone hast
given birth, in a manner transcending understanding and comprehension, to the
Word, Who with the Father and the Spirit is without beginning, and Who ever
granteth life, incorruption and great mercy to the world.

* divided the sea for the people of Israel. * For He is our God and
supremely glorious, * to Him alone let us sing, for He hath been glorified.
Come, let us bless the sacred apostles; the pillars of the Church, the
foundations of the Faith, the bulwarks of piety who make steadfast all the faithful
that we may be saved by their entreaties. (Twice)
Terrified, I, the prodigal, condemn myself even before the judgment, for I
have amassed” countless evil deeds; wherefore, I pray Thee, О righteous Judge:
Through the divine entreaties of Thine apostles save me, who am desperate.
О steadfast pillars of piety, set me aright who am ensnared by the deception of
the enemy, for I lie upon the ground in affliction, and know not what to do to
find remission for those things in which I have sinned.
Theotokion: With the holy prophets, the apostles and martyrs, О pure one,
earnestly entreat the Lord Who became incarnate of thee, that He mortify all our
carnal passions and grant us life everlasting.

bless Nicholas, the most radiant and inextinguishable beacon, the tower on earth,
who beckons us to the divine harbor.
Strengthened by the power of God, О all-blessed one, in mind thou didst
acquire zeal for piety; wherefore, thou didst deliver those who were to be unjustly
put to death. We therefore beseech thee: Deliver us from all unjust affliction, О
Nicholas!
Thou didst offer supplications to the Lord in abundance, О father, that He
deliver us from sins and the flame of everlasting torment, from perils and

doctrine, fill my soul with virtuous works and good thoughts. (Twice)
Deliver me, О disciples of Christ, from the many temptations of the wicked
one, from all manner of tribulation, from all oppression and every evil
circumstance.
Alas, О my wretched and lowly soul! Sinning often and angering God, how
canst thou ask forgiveness for thy wickedness, since thou dost not cease doing it?
Theotokion: О divine ladder which Jacob beheld, whereby God descended,
lifting us up: Earnestly pray with the apostles, that He have pity on us.
Canon of Saint Nicholas
Irmos: O barren and infertile soul, * bring forth a crop of glorious fruit and
joyously cry aloud: * I have been firmly established by Thee O God; * there
is none holy and none more righteous than Thee, O Lord.
Thou wast shown to be a sharpened sword of the Spirit, О wise father
Nicholas, cutting down the evil tares of the heretics, and smoothing the saving
paths of the virtues for the faithful.
Unto thee do we beseech, the wellspring pouring forth torrents of healings, О
holy one: By thy supplications wash us clean of the defilement of all the passions,

weakened by the assaults of the passions.

ungodliness. (Twice)
The sea of grievous sin overwhelms me, and the waves of unseemly thoughts
batter my lowly soul. О Lord my Helmsman, save me by the supplications of Thy

immaculate womb, O pure one. * Wherefore he cried; God shall come forth
from Thaeman, * and the Holy One from a mountain * densely
overshadowed.
Every one of the faithful ever setteth thee forth as a mediator before God, О
Nicholas; wherefore, we beseech thee: Deliver us from grievous perils and falls
into sin, О father.
As thou dost possess the grace of the Lord, О wise one, ever pour living water
upon the hearts of those oppressed by the burning heat of tribulations and the

early at dawn, we hymn Thee, * O Lover of mankind.
Incarnate on earth, Thou didst make the disciples heavens declaring Thy glory,
О Christ. Wherefore, for their sake, О Lord, have mercy on our souls. (Twice)

up the stench of worldly mindedness, giving drink to the assemblies of the pious.
(Twice)
Sigh and shed tears, О my lowly soul, and cry out to the Lord, saying: I have
sinned against Thee, О Master! Cleanse me, О Compassionate One, by the
entreaties of Thine most wise apostles!
Torrents of the passions have gushed forth and engulfed the house of my

up against me. * But do Thou make haste, O Savior, * to save me, and
deliver me from corruption, * as Thou didst deliver the Prophet from the
sea-monster.
Having mortified thy members by abstinence, thou didst acquire the life which
waxeth not old, wherein do thou cause us to share by thy supplications, О wise
one, through the avoidance of wicked sin.
With the mast and sails of thy sacred prayers, deliver us from the deep of
many and varied perils and the abyss of sin, О wise and holy hierarch, steering us
to the harbor of life.
Adorning the cathedra of Myra in Lycia thou wast shown to be the beauty of
high priests. О holy hierarch, by thy supplication save us unharmed by the perils

Who dwelt within thy womb, О pure Mother, dispelled the corruption which
from of old dwelt within us.
ODE VII

Persian idol, * but chanted in the midst of the furnace: * O God of our
fathers, blessed art Thou!
Christ, the Light of the world, showed you, О light-bearing apostles, to be the
light which dispelleth the darkness of delusion, enlightening the thoughts of the
faithful. (Twice)
О divinely eloquent apostles, break ye the snares which the enemy hath laid
for us, and make smooth the paths of repentance for us who have recourse unto
you.
As divine salt cleanse my soul, which hath been made foolish by the carnal
passions, О divinely eloquent disciples of the Lord, imparting to it life through
faith.
Theotokion: Enlighten me with goodly ideas, I beseech thee, О beauty of
Jacob, praying now with the apostles unto Him Who was born of thy pure blood.
Canon of Saint Nicholas
Irmos: The three children in the furnace, prefiguring the Trinity: *
trampled underfoot the threat of the fire * and cried aloud, chanting: *
Blessed art Thou, О God of our fathers!
As a true chief shepherd, О father Nicholas, with the cords of thy words thou
didst strangle the mindless Arius, who of old was leading the people of the Lord
to destruction.
Having passed thine most holy life in holiness, О father Nicholas, thou
dwellest with the saints, sending sanctification and enlightenment upon those who
piously call thee blessed.
О father Nicholas, we ever invoke thee as a ready deliverer and a fervent
helper: Deliver us from the passions and the unexpected perils which beset us!
Theotokion: О pure one who hast given birth to the Light: Enlighten me who
have darkened by soul through negligence, lighting the lamp of my heart, that I
may glorify thee with goodly diligence.
ODE VIII
Canon of the Apostles
Irmos: United together in the unbearable fire, * yet not harmed by the
flame, * the children, champions of godliness, sang a divine hymn: * O all
ye works of the Lord, * bless ye the Lord and supremely exalt Him
throughout all ages.
I have been wounded by the sword of the passions, and have injured my heart
in mindlessness, the accomplisher of evil. Heal me, who am wholly at a loss, О
glorious apostles, for ye are the physicians of men’s souls and bodies. (Twice)
The divine sound of the preachers went forth into all the earth, teaching all to
worship throughout the ages, the single Essence, the one Being of the Holy
Trinity, the one true Dominion, the one Kingship.
О Master, О Word Who knowest mine infirmity, slothfulness and evilmindedness, convert me, who have sinned greatly and have wasted Thy divine
long-suffering by remaining in my transgressions.
Theotokion: О most pure Theotokos, thou divine tongs which ineffably
received the divine Coal: Quench the burning embers of my passions with the
dew of thy prayers and those of the most glorious and divine apostles.
Canon of Saint Nicholas
Irmos: God is unceasingly glorified on high by the Angels, * O ye heaven of
heavens, * ye earth and mountains, ye plains and abysses, * and all the race
of mankind, * with hymns as to the Creator and Redeemer, * bless ye, and
supremely exalt Him throughout all ages.
As thou wast meek, О venerable one, thou didst inherit the land of the meek;
wherefore, I pray to thee with faith: By thy supplications still thou the threefold
waves of the evil one, which ever batter me.
As thou didst deliver the military commanders who were unjustly condemned
to die, so deliver us from the oppression of wicked men and from every assault of
the demons, praying to the Savior, О Nicholas.
Thou didst show us the straight path of salvation, О Nicholas. Guide us
thereto who in this life traverse it by thy prayers, that together we may enter the
gates of life.
Theotokion: He Who was born from thee is my strength and my song, О
most pure Virgin. Him do thou earnestly beseech, that He strengthen me who am
weakened by the passions, that I may keep His saving commandments.
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX
Canon of the Apostles
Irmos: In the shadow and the letter of the Law, * let us, the faithful, discern
a figure: * every male child that openeth the womb * shall be sanctified to
God. * Therefore we magnify the firstborn Word * and Son of the
beginningless Father, * the firstborn Child of a Mother who hath not
known a man.
О Word of the beginningless Father, Who by the words of Thy disciples didst
confirm the ends of the earth: By their supplications have pity on me who have
fallen headlong into irrational passions and am overwhelmed by the delusion of
the demons. (Twice)
О my soul who panders to the onslaughts of the passions, offer supplication
unto Him Who suffered for thy sake, that He may deliver thee from grievous
circumstances, for the sacred disciples plainly pray for thee, having emulated the
sufferings of His flesh.
О disciples of Christ, when ye sit with Him to judge the fate of the innocent,
keep my soul from condemnation, though it hath been defiled by unseemly deeds,
for ye are my good intercessors and the helpers of the world.
Theotokion: О pure Virgin, most pure Virgin, palace of Christ, most holy
Virgin, who beyond cause and all telling hast given birth to God, the Holiest of
the holy: With the holy apostles pray for us all.
Canon of Saint Nicholas
Irmos: Upon Mount Sinai Moses saw thee In the bush, * as one who didst
conceive the fire of the Godhead within thy womb, * and yet remained
unconsumed. * Daniel saw thee as a mountain not cut by the hand of man,
* and Isaiah proclaimed thee as the Rod that blossomed forth * from the
root of David.
The world hath acquired thee as a divine bulwark and foundation, and a
goodly refuge, for by thy mediations we are ever delivered from every temptation
and oppression, О father Nicholas. Wherefore, in praise we bless thee with faith.
Beset by many evil circumstances, I flee to the broad expanse of thy fervent
prayers, О all-blessed one. Cause the pain of my soul to cease, I cry to thee; still
thou the waves of despair, and calm the turmoil of my mind.

depths of ignorance, ye drove heathen deception from the earth and were verily

dispelled the darkness of ungodliness and guided all to the light of the knowledge
of God; wherefore, we honor you.
