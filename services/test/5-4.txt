TUESDAY EVENING: TONE V
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of the Cross, in Tone V:
Spec. Mel.: “Rejoice ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
Thou wast lifted up like a lamb upon the Cross, and didst lay low the uprisings
of the deceiver; and when Thou wast slaughtered Thou didst sanctify the whole
earth with Thy blood. Pierced by the spear, Thou didst command the flaming
sword to turn away from me, that I might dwell in paradise and partake without
fear of the tree of life. Wherefore, saved by Thy sufferings, I cry out, rejoicing:
Glory be to Thy divine Cross, whereby we have been delivered from the ancient
curse and receive from the Tree blessing and great mercy!
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
Desiring to bring an end to the pain and afflictions of all, О supremely good
Lord my Savior, Thou didst endure vile crucifixion; Thou didst taste of gall, О
Innocent One, removing the bitter taste of evil; and wounded, О Word, by the
thrust of the spear, Thou healest our wounds, in that Thou art Master. Wherefore,
we hymn Thy glorious will, and bowing down, we honor the spear, the sponge
and the reed, whereby Thou hast imparted to Thy world peace and great mercy.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
“How did the iniquitous multitude of the Jews condemn Thee to be crucified
on the Cross, О Jesus, taking no pity on Thee, the Compassionate One?”,
exclaimed the Virgin, weeping, when she beheld lifted up upon the Cross Him
Who was born from her womb without suffering; “and what hath the iniquitous
council done to Thee, О my Child most desired, my most beloved Son? Haste
Thou, and save those who glorify Thy crucifixion with faith, and those who
magnify me, as Thou didst promise, in that Thou alone art supremely good!”
Then the Stichera for the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera for the Theotokos, in the same tone:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
Desiring to utterly lift from the first-formed Adam the most painful sentence,
О sinless Christ Who lovest mankind, as the Creator of Adam Thou wast pierced 
with nails; and Thy divine side wounded for our sake with a spear, Thou dost turn
away the flaming sword, О Word, that it might no longer deny entry to us, Thy
servants. Wherefore, glorifying Thee, we hymn Thy might, and honor and praise
Thy Cross, whereby all nature hath found great mercy and an inheritance without
pain, О Lover of mankind.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
Once beholding her Lamb hastening to the slaughter, the Ewe-lamb followed
ardently, crying out to Him these things: “Whither goest Thou, О Christ, my
Child most sweet? Wherefore dost Thou run this course with haste, О longsuffering and most desired Jesus? О sinless and greatly merciful Lord, my most
beloved Son, grant discourse unto me, Thy handmaid. Spurn not in silence me
who gave birth to Thee in a strange manner, О God, Bestower of life, Who
grantest the world great mercy!”
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
Thou wast truly the throne of the cherubim, in that thou art more exalted than
all creatures: for the divine Word, desiring to restore our form, made His abode
within thee, О pure one; and having issued forth from thee as a mortal man, He
accepted the Cross and suffering for our sake, in that He is compassionate, and as
God hath bestowed resurrection. Wherefore, giving thanks to thee who hast
reconciled our condemned nature with the Creator, we cry out to Him and thee:
By thy prayers grant us remission of transgressions and mercy!
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: Desiring that all receive salvation, O my sinless Christ,
Thou wast pleased to pay a great price, Thy precious blood, for our deliverance.
Wherefore, beholding Thee nailed, Thy Mother, lamenting, rent her hair, saying:
"O Child, mine all-immaculate Lamb, Who desirest to deliver the world by Thy
precious blood, how hast Thou set to whence I cannot see, O never-setting Sun,
Who grantest unto all enlightenment, peace and great mercy?"
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone I:
Prokeimenon: Thy mercy, O Lord, shall pursue me * all the days of my life.
Verse: The Lord is my shepherd, and I shall not want. In a place of green
pasture, there hath He made me to dwell.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the Cross, in Tone V:
О Lord, of old, in the time of Moses the Prophet, the image of Thy Cross,
having been precisely revealed, vanquished Thine enemies; and now, possessed of
that same Cross, we ask Thy help: Strengthen Thy Church, for the sake of Thy
great mercy, О Lover of mankind!
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
Though a tree visible by nature, Thy Cross, О Christ, is invested with divine
power; and being tangibly revealed to the world, it wondrously and noetically
worketh our salvation. Bowing down before it, we glorify Thee, О Savior. Have
mercy on us!
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: Pray for us, О holy martyrs, that we may be delivered from
our iniquities; for unto you hath been given the grace to make supplication on our
behalf.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Spec. Mel.: “O venerable father ...”:
Stavrotheotokion: Taking upon Himself my whole form, God the Creator clad
himself therein, desiring to refashion the fallen form of Adam; and was willingly
lifted up upon the Cross as one guilty. But now stretching forth His hands, He
healeth our hands, which of old were rendered weak by stretching forth to pluck
the fruit of the tree. And the all-pure one, beholding Him, exclaimed: “What is
this Thine ineffable long-suffering, О my Son? I cannot bear to see Thee Who
holdeth the ends of the whole earth in the palm of Thy hand, lifted up upon the
Cross!”
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

ON WEDNESDAY MORNING: TONE V
AT MATINS
After the 1st chanting of the Psalter,
The Sessional hymns of the Cross, in Tone V:
The place of the skull became paradise, for no sooner was the tree of the
Cross planted than straightway Thou, the grapes of Life, sprang forth, О Savior,
unto our gladness. Glory be to Thee!
Verse: Exalt ye the Lord our God, * and worship the footstool of His feet,
for He is holy.
О ye faithful, let us hymn our Savior and Redeemer Who was willingly
crucified, as He Himself knew and was well-pleased; and let us glorify Him: For
He hath nailed our sins to the Cross, delivering the race of mankind from
delusion, and hath granted us the kingdom.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: When the Mother who bore Thee without the pangs of
childbirth * beheld Thee lifted up upon the Cross, * weeping, she lamented crying
aloud: * ‘Woe is me, O my sweetest Son! * I am wounded in depths of my soul, *
seeing Thee now nailed upon the Cross ** as a malefactor, between two thieves.’
After the 2nd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone V:
О Savior Who willingly endured crucifixion and freed us from corruption, we,
the faithful, hymn and worship Thee, for Thou hast enlightened us with the
power of the Cross; and with fear we glorify Thee as the Lord and Bestower of
life, O Compassionate Lover of mankind.
Verse: God is our King before the ages; * He hath wrought salvation in the
midst of the earth.
The tree of Thy Cross hath been shown to be salvation for the world, for
Thou wast willingly nailed to it, delivering mortals from the curse. О Lord, Joy of
all, glory be to Thee!

bless thee as is meet, ** confessing thee to be the true Theotokos. 
After the 3rd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone V:
Spec. Mel.: “The co-beginningless Word ...”:
The prophecies of the prophets have already been fulfilled; Thine ancient
counsel hath reached its end; for of Thine own will, О Christ, King of all, Thou
didst abase Thy self to assume the flesh, and for our sake didst deign to ascend
the Cross and endure death. Wherefore, we glorify Thy condescension which
passeth understanding, О Word.
When the ranks of the angels beheld Thee nailed to the Cross and having
fallen asleep, О Jesus, King of all, they were stricken with awe; and straightway the
hordes of the demons fled, and the gates of Hades were broken, the tyranny of
death was cast down, and those dead in the grave arose.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: Beholding Thee suspended on the Cross between two
thieves of Thine own will, O Christ, Thy Mother, her womb rent asunder
maternally, said: "O my sinless Son, how is it that Thou art unjustly nailed to the
Cross like a malefactor, desiring to give life to the human race, in that Thou art
compassionate?"

fifth hymn to the Virgin”, in Tone V:
Irmos: Same as the foregoing.
О Portal of divine glory, who hast opened the gates of paradise, open unto me
the doors of repentance, I pray, and enlighten my mind, that I may hymn thee, О
divinely joyous one.
Thou didst restrain the onrushing of death, О all-immaculate one who hast
given birth unto Him Who hath dominion over life and death. Him do thou
entreat, that He restrain my soul and save me, О thou who puttest transgressions
to death.
The Word Who with the Father is equally without beginning chose thee alone,
the beauty of Jacob, from among the generations of mankind, and became
incarnate from thy blood. О Lady, save me by thy mediations.

thee, О all-pure one; wherefore, dry up the teeming of my passions, I pray thee, О
Virgin Mother.

first of all to enter therein, rejoicing; and when Thou didst die, О my Jesus, the
enemy deceiver was slain, and slain Adam was given life. Glory to Thy surpassing
loving-kindness!

in vain and seek to slay me, that they may remain impotent and full of shame.
О Lady who hast poured forth upon the world the divine Water, fill me with
life-creating waters, dry up the grievous torrents of mine iniquities, and with thy
divine serenity still thou the waves of my heart.

unshakable kingdom.

of the beginningless Father!”

me every straight path of righteousness which grants entry to the will of God.

womb, * and hath borne a Son, Emmanuel, * who is both God and man; *
and Orient is His name; * Him we magnify, and the Virgin we call blessed.
Thou wast lifted up upon the Tree like a lamb, О Christ our Master, breaking
the jaws of the noetic wolf, snatching Thy reason-endowed sheep from his jaws,
and bringing them to the Father, О Master.
As King of kings Thou wast crowned with a crown of thorns, О Christ,
abolishing the rule of the evil one, and cutting the thorns of delusion off at the
root; wherefore, we glorify Thee with faith, О Good One.
To the Martyrs: Your firm and steadfast opposition shone forth like the sun
and dispelled all the gloom of the enemy, О right glorious ones, ye invincible
martyrs, enlighteners of all the faithful, unshakable towers of piety.
To the Martyrs: О all-praised martyrs of the Savior, ye were revealed to be a
divinely assembled regiment, a heavenly army, a chosen assembly, a holy
encampment, who destroy the cities of the evil one with divine grace.
Theotokion: Thou hast given birth to the Gardener, the Planter of piety Who
soweth true understanding on the earth and destroyeth the curse which grew from
the garden. And magnifying Him, we call thee, the Virgin, blessed.
Canon of the Theotokos
Irmos: Same as the foregoing.
О pure one, thou hast given birth to the Savior, the unshakable Foundation,
Who by His command founded the earth upon the waters. Him do thou entreat,
that He make us steadfast who in a pure manner call thee blessed.
О pure one, cause me to walk, unerringly and without being led astray, the
path of the humility of the precepts of God, driving far from me the turmoil of
the demons and the assaults of the passions, and granting me tranquility.
The enemy, seeing me stuck fast in the slumber of indifference, mightily
attacks me, hoping to carry me off by pleasurable dreams; but do thou thyself
preserve me by thy tireless supplication, О pure Virgin Mother.
As one self-condemned I ponder the multitude of my sins and the dread
tribunal of the Judge, at which I must needs be tried. But as she who gave birth
unto God the Judge, О Theotokos, preserve me uncondemned at that time.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the Cross, in Tone V:
No sooner was the tree of Thy Cross planted, О Christ, than the deception of
idols was driven away and grace blossomed forth; for the tyranny of
condemnation was no more, but the triumph of our salvation was made manifest.
For the Cross is our boast, the Cross is our confirmation, the Cross is our joy!
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
For our sake Thou wast led as a sheep to sacrifice and as an innocent lamb to
voluntary slaughter, О Christ Immanuel, as one reckoned among the iniquitous.
Come, О ye nations of the homeland, and hymn and worship the endless Life
Who was lifted up upon the Cross!
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: Struggling on earth, the holy martyrs endured the cold and
gave themselves over to the fire. And as the waters received them their cry was:
“We went through fire and water, and Thou didst bring us out into refreshment!”
By their supplications, О Christ God, have mercy upon us!
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: Of old, the Virgin Mother, the all-blessed Maiden,
beholding the Lamb, her Son, lifted up upon the Cross, cried out, weeping: ''Woe
is me, O my Son! How is it that Thou diest Who art in essence God immortal?"
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON WEDNESDAY MORNING: TONE V
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone V:
Believing Thee to be God, the thief on the cross confessed Thee, О Christ,
crying out in purity from the depths of his heart: Remember me, О Lord, in Thy
kingdom!
Pierced in the side, Thou didst pour forth torrents of remission, О Christ; and,
Thy hands nailed to the Cross, Thou didst discomfit all the passionate mind of
mankind.
Ascending the Cross, Thou didst fill the whole multitude of the demons with
trembling, didst cast down the pernicious might of the tyrant, О Christ our
Master, and didst save humanity.
To the Martyrs: As emulators of the sufferings of Christ, О blessed passionbearers of the Lord, ye underwent every torture; wherefore, ye have been
vouchsafed the beauties of heaven.
Glory ..., On the Cross Thou didst endure voluntary suffering, О Christ Who
art inseparable from the Father and the divine Spirit, taking away all our
corrupting passions.
Now & ever ..., She who stood before the Cross and beheld her Son wounded,
was wounded in soul and hymned His truly great dispensation.
On Wednesday, the Prokeimenon in Tone III:

behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
