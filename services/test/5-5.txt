WEDNESDAY EVENING: TONE V
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of the holy apostles, in Tone V:
Spec. Mel.: “Rejoice ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
Traversing all the earth, ye sowed divine teachings, bearing the Word alone as
a lamp and all riches, О disciples of the Lord; and thereby ye put emperors and
torturers to shame, and rent asunder the vain arguments of the philosophers and
rhetors as though they were spiders’ webs, calling all to recognize the Creator, and
abolishing the vain worship of demons. Wherefore, I pray that, by your prayers, ye
deliver me from those who are irrational.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, O Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
By your supplications unto God, deliver us all from the turmoil of
temptations, the cruel deception of shameful heresies, the evil counsel of the
demons, the fire which burneth in the absence of light, the everlasting worm, the
gnashing of teeth, and all other torments; and beseech Him that, for the sake of
your temperance and toils, we may receive the reward of the virtues, the
inheritance of the kingdom of heaven, and great mercy.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
Clearly receiving all the effulgence, and the reflected light of the ineffable
dispensation of the Trinity, insofar as human nature can so do, the all-praised
twelve perfectly manifested themselves, bringing with them the seventy-two, and
enlightening the ends of the world, darkened by the darkness of wicked heresy,
pray ye unto Christ that He grant the world great mercy.
Then the Stichera for the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera for the holy hierarch Nicholas, in the same tone and Melody:
Verse: For with the Lord there is plenteous redemption, * and He shall
redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
Rejoice, О sacred one, pure habitation of the virtues, godly standard of a
blameless priesthood, great and manifest pastor, whose radiant name signifies
victory, who mercifully heeds those who make supplication, inclining thine ear to
the pleas of the infirm, ready deliverer, saving refuge for all who with faith ever
honor thy glorious memory! Entreat Christ, that He send down upon us great
mercy.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
Rejoice, О holy hierarch Nicholas, most sacred mind, pure abode of the
Trinity, pillar of the Church, confirmation of the faithful, helper of the afflicted,
star who with the brilliant rays of thy right acceptable prayers dost ever dispel the
darkness of trial and tribulation, calm haven whereto the imperiled who flee are
saved from the threefold waves of life! Entreat Christ God, that He send down
upon our souls great mercy.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
Rejoice, standard for hierarchs, inexhaustible depths of divine wonders, beauty
of the Church, brilliant star who with thy sacred effulgence dost shed light upon
each of us, O blessed and most holy one who art illumined with most radiant
flashes of lightning, unshakable tower, stairway of faith for those who with love
keep thine honored memory: Entreat Christ, that He grant our souls great mercy.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O strange, awesome and great mystery! * The Un-circumscribable One hath
made His abode within a womb, * and a Mother remaineth a Virgin even after
birthgiving, * for from her she gave birth to God Incarnate. * To Him, then, let us
cry aloud, * to Him let us raise a hymn, * chanting with the angels: * Holy art
Thou, O Christ God, * Who wast incarnate for our sake! ** Glory be to Thee!
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone V:
Prokeimenon: O God, in Thy name save me, * and in Thy strength do
Thou judge me.
Verse: O God, hearken unto my prayer, give ear unto the words of my
mouth.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the apostles, in Tone V:
As eye-witnesses to the mysteries of the Savior, О disciples, ye preached the
Invisible One Who hath no beginning, saying: In the beginning was the Word. Ye
were not created before the angels, nor were ye taught of men, but by the wisdom
of the Most High. Wherefore, as ye have boldness, pray ye on behalf of our souls.
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
Together let us praise the apostles of the Lord with hymns, for, having arrayed
themselves in the armor of the Cross, they abolished the delusion of the demons
and were revealed to be crowned victors. By the supplications of them and all the
saints, О God, have mercy on us.
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: Your souls filled with insatiable love, О holy martyrs, ye did
not deny Christ; and enduring the divers wounds of sufferings, ye cast down the
audacity of the tormentors; and having preserved the Faith intact and unharmed,
ye were translated to the heavens. Wherefore, as ye have boldness before Him, ask
that He grant us great mercy.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
We bless thee, O Virgin Theotokos, * and we, the faithful, glorify thee as is
meet, * thou unassailable city, * impregnable rampart, ** and steadfast intercession
and refuge of our souls.

ON THURSDAY MORNING: TONE V
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone V:
Believing Thee to be God, the thief on the cross confessed Thee, О Christ,
crying out in purity from the depths of his heart: Remember me, О Lord, in Thy
kingdom!
Like radiant clouds ye traversed the earth, О divine disciples, letting fall the
water of life; and ye give drink in abundance to hearts withering away through
transgressions.
As mystic rays of the Sun Who shone forth from the pure Virgin, О divine
disciples of Christ our God, ye have enlightened those who sit in the darkness of
ignorance.
That Thou mightest recover the coin buried in the abyss of transgressions, О
Christ, and bring it to the Father, through the divine Spirit Thou didst ordain the
apostles as preachers.
To the Martyrs: Enduring the burning of cruel tortures, О most wise ones, ye
burned up the falsehood of the idols and have passed over to divine consolation,
О saints.
Glory ..., О supremely divine Trinity, single Godhead - beginningless Father,
Son Who art equally without beginning, and Holy Spirit - Preserve Thy Church
through the supplications of all who preach Thee!
Now & ever ..., О divinely joyous one, adornment of the apostles: With rays of
repentance enlighten me who am darkened by the pleasures of life, that I may
magnify thee.
