On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of repentance, in Tone I:
Spec. Mel.: “O all-praised martyrs ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
In Thy goodness, О Lord, Thou didst bring all things about by Thy Word and
Spirit, and didst also create me a reason-endowed living thing, that I might glorify
Thine omnipotent name. But, more than any, I ever act dishonorably by my
shameful deeds; yet have pity on me, I pray.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
I recognize thy divine nobility and the incorrupt homeland, О wretched soul,
and I ever strive to attain them by goodly deeds. Let naught that is corrupt
captivate me. Thou art my higher part, while the body is earth and corrupteth. Let
not what is baser overcome that which is higher.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
Go thou to the Supremely good One, О all-accursed soul; approach Him with
fervent tears; before thy condemnation confess all things that thou hast done; and
render thy Creator merciful to thee, О wretched one. Beg forgiveness, lest the
Lord shut the door to thee.
Then the Stichera. of the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these

redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
О incorporeal angels, who stand before the throne of God, illumined by the
splendors thereof, О ye secondary luminaries who shine forth eternally with
outpourings of light: Entreat Christ, that He grant our souls peace and great
mercy.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
О immortal angels who are most noetically rich, who receive truly
indestructible life from the primal Life: Ye have become holy seers of eternal glory
and wisdom, are filled with light, and have excellently been revealed to be beacons
sharing therein.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
О archangels, angels, principalities, thrones, dominions, six-winged seraphim
and divine and many-eyed cherubim, ye organs of wisdom, powers and most
divine authorities: Pray ye unto Christ, that He grant our souls peace and great
mercy.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:

On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone I:
Great is the abyss of my many transgressions, О Savior, and I sink grievously
because of mine offenses. Grant me Thy hand, as Thou didst to Peter, О God.
Save me, and have mercy upon me!
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her Mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
In that I have been condemned for wicked thoughts and deeds, О Savior,
grant me the thought of returning to Thee, О God, that I may cry aloud: Save me,
О good Benefactor, and have mercy upon me!
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: Through the prayers of all the saints and the Theotokos, О
Lord, grant us Thy peace, and have mercy upon us, in that Thou alone art
compassionate.
Glory..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Joy of the ranks of heaven, * and mighty intercession for mankind on earth, *

God, have we placed our hope, ** O Theotokos.

glorified in strength, O Immortal One; * for in its infinite strength it
shattered the enemy, * fashioning anew a path for the Israelites through the
deep.
Ineffably didst thou conceive God, О most pure Lady, and supra-naturally
didst thou give birth to Him Who hath set mortals free from their transgressions.
Wherefore, I entreat thee: Deliver me from my manifold transgressions!
Though I am engulfed by tribulations and the abyss of countless sins and
sorrows, yet through thy mighty guidance and supplication, О all-immaculate one,
do thou direct me to the divine stillness of repentance.
Glory ..., From the manifold misfortunes of my whole life do thou deliver me,
О intercessor, that I may raise my voice in thanksgiving to thee: О pure

high, * that I may cry unto Thee: * Holy is the animate temple of Thine
ineffable glory, O Lover of mankind!
The sight of thy pure face delights the angels, and is salvific to mortals, but it
is terrible to the spirits of wickedness! And, honoring and venerating it with faith,
О Theotokos, we illumine our souls!
With virginal blood from thee, the Creator and Lord wrapped Himself in flesh.
О all-immaculate one, entreat Him, that, in His ineffable mercy, He take pity on
me who am become corrupt through mine unseemly deeds.

helper, leading me to God and granting me glory and life everlasting, О most

ODE IV
Irmos: Perceiving thee with prophetic eyes * as the mountain
overshadowed by the grace of God, * Habbakuk proclaimed that the Holy
One of Israel * would come forth from thee, * for our salvation and
restoration.
An unrestrainable urge for evil doth seize me through the activity of the enemy
and mine own wicked habits. Help me, О Lady, that the most pernicious one not
fall upon me utterly, depriving me of repentance through death.
All the time of my life have I squandered in the prodigality of wickedness; and
now the servants thereof lead my lowly soul into cruel woundings. Help me, О
Virgin Birthgiver of God!
Glory ..., О all-immaculate one, hearken to my cry of pain, which I bring forth
in groans from the depths of my soul; and grant me release from the debts which,
wretch that I am, I have incurred through my mindless thoughts and character.

down before thee and cry out with tears: О Theotokos, deliver me from the darts
of the alien and from the difficult tests that are to come!

help, refuge and mine invincible intercessor, О most holy Virgin Theotokos.
Wherefore, save thou thy servant!
Glory ..., With the sprinkling of thy divine supplication, О most pure
Theotokos, cleanse my wretched soul which hath been defiled by the passions,
granting it the splendid vesture of thy salvation.

beseech thee: Stand thou forth, saving me, О Mother of Christ God!

Thy people O our God, * for thou art the strength and restoration of the
weak.

unto me and rescue me from the abyss of the evils which, wretch that I am, I have

Arise thou, О pure one, to aid thy servant who, placing my hope in thee and
God, hastens to thine invincible aid, that the enemy be not able to seize and
destroy me.

fallen and cleansing of the sinful, and with tears I fall down and cry out to thee:
As thou art mighty, save me who am perishing!
Now & ever ..., Have mercy upon my lowly soul, О pure one, go thou before
it and rescue it, snatching it from the talons of the evil one; for he seeketh to send
it into the abyss because of the evils which my great slothfulness hath wrought.
Lord, have mercy, (Thrice).
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Sessional hymn, in Tone I:
Spec. Mel.: “Thy tomb, О Savior ...”:

we hasten to thy holy church, asking help of thee, О Ever-virgin. Wherefore,
deliver us who bless thee from the malice of the demons, from torment and dread
condemnation.
ODE VII
Irmos: We the faithful perceive thee, O Theotokos, * to be a noetic furnace;
* for as He, the supremely exalted One, * saved the three children, * so
hath He wholly refashioned fallen humanity, in thy womb, * O Thou
praised and supremely glorified God of our fathers.
Thou wast a divine tabernacle for the Master, having conceived Him in thy
womb and given birth to Him in the flesh, О only immaculate one. Wherefore,
deliver us from sufferings, pain, tribulations and debts, for thou hast might and
great power.
О pure Lady, put an end to the unbearable pain of my most wretched soul,
giving me true joy and freeing me from the raging billows of my many
transgressions. For thou art my refuge and deliverance.

as an invincible tower and foundation, a token of steadfastness, and through thee
I hope to receive the kingdom, О Lady.

through thee hath He, appearing, freed all from darkness and ignorance, and from
fetid transgressions. Wherefore, I cry to thee: Free me from the outer darkness!
ODE VIII
Irmos: In the furnace as in a fiery smelter * the Israelite children shone
more brightly than gold * with the beauty of godliness, * as they exclaimed:
Bless the Lord all ye works of the Lord, * hymn and supremely exalt Him
throughout all ages.
The turmoil of the passions cruelly afflict my soul, О Theotokos. As thou hast
given birth to the Author and Bestower of peace and tranquility, О pure one, fill
me with serene joy and gladness, preserving me in peace.
Thou hast been revealed to us as the mediatress of salvation who hast given
birth to the Savior and Master of all, О Theotokos. Wherefore, I entreat thee:
Grant salvation to my lowly soul, that with faith I may sing hymns to thee
throughout all ages.

corruption and from every temptation, and grant that I may ever cry: Bless the
Lord, all ye works of the Lord! Hymn and supremely exalt Him throughout all
ages!

Him do thou beseech, that He grant cleansing from transgressions and deliverance
from tribulations, perils, from everlasting fire and condemnation, to those who
unceasingly glorify thy glory.

pure birthgiving, O Theotokos. * Wherefore we now entreat Thee: *
quench the raging furnace of temptations that beset us, * that we may
unceasingly magnify Thee.
О all-immaculate Mother of God, open unto me the depths of thy mercy, and
deliver me from the mouth of the noetic wolf, who seeketh to devour and ruin
me. Have mercy, I pray thee, and turn not away from me, thy shameful servant.
Be thou the intercessor for my whole life and my steadfast aid, О all-pure one,
and deliver me from manifold perils and grief, and from the blasphemy of mine
enemies, and deliver me from everlasting fire.
Glory ..., Thou alone art the visitation of the sick. Thou alone art the setting
aright of the fallen. Thou alone art our guide and entry unto God. Thou alone art
the mediatress of everlasting good things. Have mercy upon me, who alone have
sinned more than all others!
Now & ever ..., Accept thou my tearful supplication, and grant me remission
of the offenses and many evils which I have committed, О Theotokos, all-hymned
Lady; for I perish utterly in my boundless despair.

and save me!
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.

be­fore Thee!
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.
Thy tribunal is awesome, Thy judgment righteous, and my deeds are evil. Yet
do Thou, О Merciful One, go before me and save me. Free me from torment, О

may stand at Thy right hand, О most just Judge.
Verse: Wondrous is God in His saints, * the God of lsrael.
To the Martyrs: О Lord, the glorious passion-bearers were invested by Thee

save me.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Set aright my wretched soul, О pure one, and have pity on it which, through

son, and save me.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:

multitude of my sins, I pray Thee, and grant me the thought of returning to Thee,
that I may glorify Thy goodness, which is past understanding.

incarnate man; wherefore, accept me who have sinned more than any other man,
О Word of God, and who now fall down before Thy compassions in repentance.

Arise and step forth, О my soul, and cry out to thy Creator, Who knoweth all
thy hidden things; and show forth fruits of repentance, that the compassionate
Lord may have mercy on thee and deliver thee from everlasting fire.

weight of my transgressions, and am filled with immeasurable shame!

Canon of the Angels
Irmos: Thou alone knowest the weakness ...,
Directly approaching the deifying Light, and filled therewith in multifarious
ways, the seraphim were manifestly the first to be enlightened by the primal
radiances, and became like secondary luminaries, deified by the Godhead. (Twice)

from God, O ye faithful, in purity of mind and with most pure mouths let us beg
to receive their effulgence.

upon me, О Good One, granting me compunction and sighs before the end of
my life, as Thou didst to the harlot of old who clasped Thy feet, О Master.

divine love; wherefore, bedewed, the God-bearers rejoiced in the expectation of

patiently endured dismemberment, and with the cords of their mighty endurance
they strangled the greatly crafty one.

forth the divine hosts as secondary luminaries which receive the primal Light and
cry out: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! Hymn and supremely exalt Him
throughout all ages!
The primal Mind and Creator trans-essentially made celestial the angelic
intelligences, who clearly draw nigh unto Him and cry: Bless the Lord, all ye works
of the Lord! Hymn and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!
Theotokion: Unto Him Who was begotten by the Father before time in a
manner past describing thou didst ineffably give birth for us, О all-immaculate
Virgin. Unto Him do we cry: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! Hymn and
supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: The Bush, which burnt without being consumed, * prefigured thy
pure birthgiving, O Theotokos. * Wherefore we now entreat Thee: *
quench the raging furnace of temptations that beset us, * that we may
unceasingly magnify Thee.
Like the Canaanite woman I cry unto Thee: Have mercy on me, О Word! For
I have a soul which is prey to the assaults of the demons, which mindlessly
committeth iniquities and which lacketh all godly fear of Thee, О Long-suffering
One.
О Lord, set Thou the feet of my soul upon the rock of Thy precepts; tread
down the serpent, who shamelessly desires to trip me, and deliver me from his
malice, in that Thou art good and greatly merciful.
To the Martyrs: Having first withstood the roiling waters of temptations and
the storm of grievous wounds, О martyrs, ye manifestly attained unto the harbor
of the heavenly kingdom, finding delight in divine tranquility.
To the Martyrs: Ye were deemed worthy to become radiant martyrs for the
never-setting Light, and have made your abode in the Church of the firstborn; and
ye rejoice with the angelic choirs, and with them entreat the Bestower of life on
our behalf.
Theotokion: Thou bearest Him Who sustaineth all things, and givest suck
unto Him Who giveth food unto all. Great and awesome beyond understanding is
the mystery of thee, О Virgin Theotokos, who art adored in holiness. Wherefore,
we bless thee with faith.
Canon of the Angels
Irmos: The Bush, which burnt without being consumed ...,
О Savior, Thou didst create the incorporeal intelligences to share in Thine
ineffable glory. By them do Thou preserve now Thy people, who flee unto Thee
with faith and love, that we may magnify Thee directly, О Master.
Send Thou an angel of peace to preserve Thy flock, О Almighty; for Thou art
the Cause of peace and love, preserving the divinely wise Faith, and destroying all
heresies by Thy power.
All the delight of which we sing, the radiance of heavenly delight, do Thou
plant in Thy Churches, О Master; and grant us the state wherein with piety we
may unceasingly magnify Thee, the Savior.
Theotokion: The ranks of angels now unceasingly hymn thy birthgiving, О
most pure one, for they stand in rank, gazing upon and sharing in His gladness;
and they unceasingly magnify thee, the Theotokos.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone I:
The next world awaiteth thee, О soul, and the Judge will rebuke thy hidden
and evil deeds. Wherefore, tarry not amid the things that are here, but step forth
beforetime, crying out to the Judge: Cleanse me, О God, and save me!
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
Overlook me not who am beset by sinful sloth, О my Savior, but lift my mind
up to repentance, and show me to be a skillful laborer in Thy vineyard. Grant
unto me the reward of the eleventh hour, and great mercy.
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: Come, О ye people, and with hymns and spiritual songs let us
all honor the passion-bearers of Christ, for they are the luminaries of the world
and the preachers of the Faith, the ever-flowing fountain from whence healings
pour forth upon the faithful. By their supplications, О Christ our God, grant
peace to Thy world and great mercy to our souls.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O thou who art more holy than all the holy powers * and more honorable than
all creation, * O Theotokos, thou Sovereign Lady of the world, * who didst give
birth to the Savior, * by thy supplications save us from countless transgressions
and difficulties, ** in that thou art good.
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparion.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON MONDAY MORNING: TONE I
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone I:
By food the enemy led Adam out of paradise, but by the Cross Christ led back
into it the thief who cried out: Remember me, О Lord, when Thou comest in Thy
kingdom!
By Thy loving-kindness, О Christ God, grant me a well-spring of
compunction to cleanse me of all the defilement of countless evils, and cause me
to share in Thy kingdom, О Benefactor.
We bring the ranks of Thine angels before Thee to make supplications, О
Christ. Have pity on us through them, in that Thou art supremely good,
overlooking all our transgressions, whether committed in knowledge or in
ignorance.
To the Martyrs: With the outpourings of your blood ye manifestly drowned
the noetic pharaoh, О saints; and ye now pour forth torrents of miracles which
dry up the abyss of infirmities. Wherefore, ye are called blessed.
Glory ..., Let all of us, the faithful, worship the Father, glorify the Son, and
hymn the all-holy Spirit, crying out and saying: О all-holy Trinity, save us all!
Now & ever ..., О most immaculate one, who hast given birth to the timeless
Light, with light guide my soul which hath ever been darkened by the assaults of
the demons, and by thy mediations free it from the fire which is to come.
On Monday, the Prokeimenon, in Tone IV:
Prokeimenon, in Tone IV: He maketh His angels spirits, * and His
ministers a flame of fire.
Verse: Bless the Lord, O my soul; O Lord my God, Thou hast been
magnified exceedingly.
Alleluia, in Tone V: Praise Him, all ye His angels; praise Him all ye His
hosts.
Verse: For He spake, and they came to be; He commanded, and they were
created.
Communion Verse: He maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame
of fire.
