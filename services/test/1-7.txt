FRIDAY EVENING: TONE I
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ... ”, these Stichera of the Saints, in Tone I:
Spec. Mel.: “O all-praised, martyrs ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
The triumphal solemnity of the martyrs drowned a multitude of the demons in
the streams of their blood, caused all the abominable sacrifices to cease, and set at
naught the deception of the idols, for they suffered patiently. And they now
entreat Christ to grant our souls peace and great mercy.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
With wise words and doctrines the most sacred pastors taught all to glorify the
threefold Godhead in Unity, divinely avoiding the commingling and division of Its
Hypostases; and they now pray that peace and great mercy be granted our souls.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
The company of the venerable lulled carnal desires to sleep and restrained
their onslaughts, showing their life to be angelic; wherefore, they now join chorus
in the habitations of heaven, entreating Christ to grant our souls peace and great
mercy.
Then these other Stichera, of the martyrs, in the same tone:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
By the prayers, O Lord, of all the saints and of the Theotokos, grant us. Thy
peace and have mercy upon us, for Thou alone art compassionate.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
The confession of faith that ye made at the tribunal, O ye saints, set at naught
the strength of the demons, and set men free from error. As ye were beheaded ye
cried aloud: “May the sacrifice of our lives be acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord; for,
desiring Thee the Lover of mankind, we have spurned this quickly passing life.”
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
Wise was the trade that ye made, O saints! Giving your blood, and inheriting
heaven as your reward; Having suffered tribulation for a time, ye now rejoice
eternally. Truly wisely have ye traded: forsaking things corruptible, ye have
received things incorruptible; and rejoicing with the choirs of angels ye now hymn
eternally the praises of the consubstantial Trinity.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Dogmatic Theotokion, in the same tone:
Let us hymn the whole world’s glory, * who sprang forth from mankind and
who gave birth to the Master, * the Portal of heaven, Mary the Virgin, * the hymn
of the Bodiless Powers and adornment of the faithful; * for she hath been
revealed as the Heaven and Temple of the Godhead. * By destroying the middle
wall, she hath brought forth peace, * and opened wide the Kingdom. * Therefore,
holding fast to her as a firm confirmation of the faith, * we have as our champion
the Lord born from her. * Take courage therefore, take courage, O ye people of
God; ** for as the Invincible one he shall conquer our adversaries.
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone VII:
Prokeimenon: O God, my helper art Thou, * and Thy mercy shall go
before me.
Verse: Rescue me from mine enemies, O God, and from them that rise up
against me redeem me.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
Aposticha Stichera of the holy martyrs, in Tone I:
O all-praised martyrs, the earth did not hide you, but heaven hath received
you; the gates of Paradise were opened to you, and entering within ye have
partaken of the tree of life. Pray ye to Christ that He grant peace and great mercy
to our souls.
Verse: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, О
Lord.
For the reposed: What sweet-pleasure in this life remaineth untouched by
grief? What glory endureth unchanged upon the earth? All is feebler than a
shadow, more deceptive than a dream; for death in a single moment taketh away
all these things. But in the light of Thy countenance, O Christ, and in the
enjoyment of Thy beauty, grant rest to those whom Thou hast chosen, for Thou
art the Lover of mankind.
Verse: Their souls * shall dwell among good things.
For the reposed: There is none free from sin, save Thou, O immortal One.
Wherefore, by Thy loving-kindness, in that Thou art a compassionate God, grant
unto Thy servants a dwelling-place in the Light, with the choirs of Thine angels,
and overlooking their transgressions, grant them forgiveness.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Truly wondrous beyond understanding * are the mighty works of thy
birthgiving O Bride of God, * which all the prophets proclaimed, * and thy
conception and birth giving are most glorious, * O all-hymned one, * whereby
thine Offspring hath incomprehensibly and ineffably saved the world, ** in that
He is full of loving-kindness. 
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

Irmos: The stone which the builders have rejected, * the same hath become
the cornerstone: * this is the rock upon which Christ hath established the
Church, * which He hath redeemed from among the nations.
The darkness of transgressions surroundeth my heart, О Lady, and I dare not
lift up mine eyes to heaven. Wherefore, I cry: Enlighten my mind, soul and heart
with the precepts of Christ!
I gaze upon thy divine image, and I honor thee, the seal of the Master, the
most pure Mother, as the prototype. And I kiss it, and bow down, and praise it,
knowing thine honor and His alone.
Glory ..., Halt the cruel assaults of the body, and quench thou the flame of the
passions, О Virgin, wherewith the cruel serpent weaves greatly tangled bonds
offenses round about me, desiring to drag me down to destruction.
Now & ever ..., Issuing forth bodily, the Word clothed Himself wholly in
Adam through thee. Him do thou therefore beseech, that He deliver us from the
passions, from divers perils and everlasting fire.
ODE IV

the Word, * thou didst proclaim, crying aloud: * When the years draw nigh,

forth! * Glory to Thy power, O Lord! 
Having given birth to the Creator and Fashioner of all, О Virgin, thou hast
ineffable power and invincible might, and savest those who approach thee with
faith. Wherefore, I cry to thee: О Sovereign Lady of the world, help me!

wretched heart, О Lady, and grant me divine serenity and peace, that I may hymn
thee in gladness.
Glory ..., Thou art the hope of the hopeless, helper of the poor, consolation of
those who weep, cleansing of the sinful, guide of the lost, healer of the sick and

Irmos: Emulating the Prophet Jonah, I cry aloud: * Free Thou my life from
corruption, O Good One; * and save me who crieth out: * O Savior of the
world, Glory be to Thee!
Thou preservest me alive, delivering me from dangers. In thy loving-kindness
do thou also stand before me when I depart this earth for life everlasting, О
Virgin Mother.
Thou art an indestructible rampart, thou art a firm wall of protection, thou art
a mighty intercessor for thy servant, О good Theotokos; wherefore, I ever call
upon thee.
Glory ..., Having acquired powerful supplications before God, О good
Theotokos, disdain not me who fervently flee to thy protection and cry aloud:
Have mercy on me, О Mother of the God of all!
Now & ever ..., Reject me not, neither spurn me, О Savior, for the ewe-lamb
who gave Thee birth in the flesh entreateth Thee with Thine apostles, prophets
and passion-bearers.
Lord, have mercy, (Thrice).
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Sessional hymn, in Tone I:
О most pure Maiden, the prophets foretold thee as the cloud of the eternal
light of God, the ark, the candlestand and jar, and the unquarried mountain; for in
the latter times Christ our God came forth from thee without seed, as was the
Father’s good pleasure.
ODE VII
Irmos: Thy children who were in the furnace O Savior, * were neither
touched nor troubled by The fire. * Whereupon the three sang, as with a
single mouth * Thy praises and blessed Thee, saying: * 'O God of our
fathers, Blessed art Thou.'
Hastening in thy loving-kindness, О most pure Lady, deliver me, who am
brought to despondency by transgressions and the pleasures of the flesh and who
am thrust into the abyss of destruction, О pure one.

thou for me a guide to the Creator, granting me deliverance from transgressions in
thy compassion.

Christ our joy. By thy power, О most immaculate one, break thou also the curse
which I have incurred through sin, and grant me joy.

and night, praying with contrite thoughts. Grant us deliverance from our offenses
by thy supplications.

their Lord and Creator, * ye priests hymn, ye children praise, * ye peoples
bless and supremely exalt * throughout all ages.
Arise, go forth and do battle against the enemies who trouble and oppress us
in vain, delivering us by thy power, О holy virgin, thou helper of the world!
Thou hast saved the world from death and corruption by thy divine
birthgiving, О good Virgin; and now, by thy supplications, rescue from the
passions and save us who praise thee.
Glory ..., Great and ineffable is thy might, О Virgin, and many and invincible
are thy divine compassions and loving-kindness. Wherefore, save us who call
upon thee in truth.
Now & ever ..., As an animate vine, О Virgin, thou didst put forth for us the
ripe Cluster, Who hath poured forth the wine of remission and dried up the
drunkenness of sin.

Irmos: The light-bearing cloud upon whom * the beginningless Master of
all descended from heaven, * like the dew upon the fleece, * and of whom
He was incarnate, * becoming a man for our sake, * let us all magnify as
the pure Mother of God.
Greatly tempest-tossed upon the sea of life by carnal pleasures, I fall down
before thee and cry aloud: Have mercy on me, who flee unto thee, О Lady, and
extend to me a hand of salvation, delivering me from the abyss of destruction!
To thee do I confess my sins, О Virgin; before thy face do I disclose my
shame; and I cry to thee from the depths of my soul “Have mercy and take pity,
О most pure one, for on thee and God have I set my firm hope"!
Glory ..., With all my soul I call upon thee who hast given birth without seed
to the Creator and Master, and I cry out earnestly: Save me from the corruption of
manifold transgressions, and deliver me from the unquenchable fire, О most holy

AT MATINS
After the 1st chanting of the Psalter, the
Sessional hymns of the martyrs, in Tone I:
О Lord, the glorious passion-bearers were invested by Thee with the boast of
suffering and the dignity of crowns; for by enduring wounds they vanquished the
iniquitous, and by divine power they received victory from heaven. Through their
supplications free me also from the invisible foe, О Savior, and save me.
Verse: Wondrous is God in His saints, * the God of Israel.
As valiant warriors, believing with oneness of mind, ye were undaunted by the
threats of the tyrants, О holy ones. Eagerly coming to Christ, and taking up the

debts, О pure one, hymning God Who is supremely glorious.
ODE VIII
Canon of All Saints
Irmos: Him of whom the angels and all the hosts of heaven are in awe * as
their Lord and Creator, * ye priests hymn, ye children praise, * ye peoples
bless and supremely exalt * throughout all ages.
Most gloriously cooled by the fire of the divine Spirit, all the martyrs passed
the mouths of the lions and the boiling of cauldrons unharmed.
Having granted Thy prophets to foresee things afar off, in a sacred manner
Thou didst make wise Thy holy hierarchs. Through their supplications, О Christ
God, enlighten the hearts of those who hymn Thee with faith.
О venerable ascetics, who crucified yourselves to the world, ye have inherited
heavenly life with those who from all the ages pleased God in holiness and
righteousness.
For the reposed: О Thou Who as God didst fashion man from the earth, in
that Thou art good Thou hast taken the faithful from the earth. Grant them the
food of paradise, overlooking all things they have committed.
Theotokion: Knowing thee to be manifestly good and immaculate among
women, the women who suffered make entreaty with thee unto God, О pure
Virgin, that thy servants may be saved from misfortunes.
Canon of the Departed
Irmos: In the furnace as in a fiery smelter * the Israelite children shone
more brightly than gold * with the beauty of godliness, * as they exclaimed:
Bless the Lord all ye works of the Lord, * hymn and supremely exalt Him
throughout all ages.
Refrain: Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel.
To the Martyrs: Having washed away all defilement from Thy departed
servants with the dew of Thy love for mankind, grant them to hymn Thee with
songs: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! Hymn and supremely exalt Him
throughout all ages!
Refrain: Grant rest, О Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants.
For the reposed: Show forth the faithful whom Thou hast translated, О
Savior, to be intercessors at Thy right hand, justifying them by the supplications of
the passion-bearers, that they may chant: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord!
Hymn and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!
Glory..., For the reposed: О Thou Who hast all authority over death and life,
be Thou well-pleased that those who have fallen asleep in faith may receive Thine
effulgence, and may cry: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord! Hymn and
supremely exalt Him throughout the ages!
Now & ever ..., Theotokion: Thou wast for us the mediatress of salvation, О
all-immaculate one, and our sojourn in radiance for eons untold. Thee, О pure
Virgin, do all of the works of the Lord, ever bless and supremely exalt throughout
all ages.
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX
Canon of All Saints
Irmos: The ever-flowing wellspring of life, * light-bearing candlestick of
grace, * the animate temple, and most pure cloud, * wider than the heavens
and the earth, * the Theotokos do we the faithful magnify.
Rejoicing, let us honor the sacred contests of the sacred martyrs, the sufferings
and wounds, nailings and banishments, and blessed sacrifice, whereby they were
shown to be heirs of Christ.
As priests of God the divine favorites were clothed in righteousness; for
having lived in holiness those who manifestly reached the end of their life in
fasting rejoice, magnifying Christ.
As divine mouths of the Lord, all the prophets proclaimed beforehand His
light unto all; and with them now rejoice the women who struggled mightily and
pleased God by fasting.
For the reposed: О Power Who reignest over all, those whom Thou hast taken
from the earth do Thou show to share with Thy saints in Thy kingdom; and in
Thine all-great goodness, О God of all, overlook the things they have committed.
Theotokion: О thou who hast given birth to the divine and timeless Light,
remit all my transgressions in time by thy prayers; and enlighten my mind, which
is ever darkened by slothfulness, that I may hymn and magnify thee with faith.
Canon of the Departed
Irmos: The Bush, which burnt without being consumed, * prefigured thy
pure birthgiving, O Theotokos. * Wherefore we now entreat Thee: *
quench the raging furnace of temptations that beset us, * that we may
unceasingly magnify Thee.
Refrain: Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel.
To the Martyrs: In that Thou art a merciful God Who lovest mankind, have
pity on Thy creation, and grant rest in the habitations of Thy saints unto those
who have departed, where all the martyrs rejoice, О greatly Merciful One.
Refrain: Grant rest, О Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants.
For the reposed: О Lover of mankind, as Thou art possessed of an abyss of
mercies which overwhelmeth the transgressions of Thy servants, receive those
whom Thou hast chosen, giving rest to them in the bosom of Abraham, and
granting them to dwell with Lazarus in Thy light.
Glory ..., For the reposed: As the Redeemer and Savior of the race of mankind,
for the sake of Thy crucifixion grant divine sweetness, life incorruptible, gladness
and radiance unto those whom Thou hast now taken from among us, as our
Benefactor.
Now & ever ..., Theotokion: О thy wonders which transcend understanding!
For thou alone, О Virgin, hast granted all under the heavens to understand the
newest miracle of thine incomprehensible birthgiving. Wherefore, we all magnify
thee, О most pure one.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Praises, these Stichera of the martyrs, in Tone I:
Verse: Praise Him for His mighty acts, * praise Him according to the
multitude of His greatness.
To the Martyrs: Come, all ye peoples, and with hymns and spiritual odes let us
honour the passion-bearers of Christ, the luminaries of the world and preachers of
the faith, the ever-flowing fountain from whence poureth forth healing upon the
faithful. By their prayers, O Christ our God, grant peace to Thy world, and to our
souls great mercy.
Verse: Praise Him with the sound of trumpet, * praise Him with the
psaltery and harp.
These are the warriors of the mighty King, who opposed the edicts of the
tyrants and bravely scorned all tortures. Trampling every delusion underfoot, they
have been crowned as is meet: and they entreat Thee O Savior that peace be
granted to Thy world, and great mercy upon our souls.
Verse: Praise Him with timbrel and dance, * praise him with strings and
flute.
O ye most lauded martyrs, neither tribulation nor oppression, nor hunger,
neither scourging, nor the fury of wild beasts nor the sword, nor the threat of fire,
could separate you from God. But suffering out of love for Him, as though in
others’ bodies, ye forgot your own nature and spurned death. Wherefore as is
meet, ye received the reward of your pangs, inheriting the heavenly Kingdom.
Pray ye on behalf of our souls.
Verse: Praise Him with tuneful cymbals, praise Him with cymbals of
jubilation. * Let every breath praise the Lord.
Rejoice in the Lord, O ye martyrs, for ye have fought the good fight. Ye
resisted emperors and vanquished tyrants; ye feared neither fire nor the sword,
nor the wild beasts that devoured your bodies. But, sending up hymnody with the
angels to Christ, ye received crowns from heaven. Pray ye that peace be granted to
the world, and great mercy to our souls.
Glory ...,
For the reposed: In very deed O my Savior, Thou hast revealed Thyself to be
the resurrection of all; for by Thy word Thou didst raise Lazarus from the dead, O
Word. And when the dead arose from the graves, and the gates of Hades were
shattered, Thou didst reveal the death of man, to be but sleep. O Thou Who came
to save, and not judge, Thy creature: grant rest in Thy loving compassion to those
whom Thou hast chosen.
Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Rejoice, O holy Virgin Theotokos * who art one of us, * thou pure vessel of all
the world, * inextinguishable lamp, * dwelling-place of the Boundless One, *
indestructible temple! * Rejoice, thou from whom the Lamb of God was born, **
who taketh away the sins of all the world.
Aposticha Stichera of the departed, the composition of Theophanes, in Tone I:
Spec. Mel..: “O all-praised martyrs ...”:
We entreat Thee, О Savior: Grant Thy sweet fellowship unto those who have
fallen asleep, and by Thy loving-kindness cause them to dwell with Thy saints in
the habitations of the righteous and the abodes of heaven, overlooking their
iniquities and granting them rest.
Verse: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, О
Lord.
Transcending things visible, О Savior, are Thy promises, which eye hath not
seen, nor ear heard, and which have never entered the heart of man. We beseech
Thee, О Master: Grant that those who have passed over to Thee may receive Thy
sweet fellowship; and life everlasting.
Verse: Their souls * shall dwell among good things.
Rejoicing in Thy Cross and setting their hope thereon, Thy servants have
passed over to Thee, О Thou Lover of mankind. Grant them now deliverance
from their transgressions, by Thy Cross, and the Blood which Thou didst shed for
the life of the world, forgiving them their offenses in Thy kindheartedness, and
illumining them with the light of Thy countenance.
Verse: Their memorial * is from generation to generation.
There is none free from sin, save Thou, O immortal One. Wherefore, by Thy
loving-kindness, in that Thou art a compassionate God, grant unto Thy servants a
dwelling-place in the Light, with the choirs of Thine angels, and overlooking their
transgressions, grant them forgiveness.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Pray to Christ Thy Child, O Virgin Mother, * that He may grant to Thy
servants forgiveness of sins, * who with a proper faith in the dogmas of the
Church * proclaim thee to be the Theotokos; * and may He deem them worthy **
of the radiance and glory of the saints in His Kingdom.
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON SATURDAY MORNING: TONE I
AT THE LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone I:
By food the enemy led Adam out of paradise, but by the Cross Christ led back
into it the thief who cried out: Remember me, О Lord, when Thou comest in Thy
kingdom!
The countless multitude of Thy spiritual athletes: the holy hierarchs, the most
wise women and the most glorious prophets; entreat Thee, О Jesus our God:
Grant us remission of transgressions, and great mercy.
О most sacred spiritual athletes of Christ, who have finished your race, with
the sacred hierarchs and prophets ye have been deemed worthy to dwell in the
heavenly city, rejoicing with the angels.
О Christ, in never-waning light settle those whom Thou hast taken to Thyself,
overlooking their transgressions, in that Thou art the compassionate God, that we
may glorify Thine incalculable mercy, О Benefactor.
Glory..., We worship the Father, we glorify the Son, and all of us, the faithful,
hymn the most holy Spirit. Remember us who cry to Thee, О God the
consubstantial Trinity and Unity.
Now & ever ..., We hymn thee, О pure one, as the spacious palace, the throne
of glory and the cloud of light; and we pray: Dispel the gloomy cloud from our
souls by thy divine supplications.

Lord. Their memorial is unto generation and generation.
