FRIDAY EVENING: TONE III
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of the Saints, in Tone III:
Spec. Mel.: “Great is the power of Thy martyrs, О Christ ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
Having endured wounds, fetters and divers tortures, suffering mightily, the
valiant martyrs were brought to their divine inheritance which is truly devoid of
pain, the heritage of their pangs.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
О holy hierarchs of the Lord, who piously uttered divine discourse, and
thereby set at naught all the arguments of the heretics, showing yourselves to be
exceedingly sure paragons for all the faithful; wherefore ye are honored.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
While in your material bodies, ye emulated the ranks of the immaterial and
incorporeal beings, О God-bearing fathers, most gloriously exhibiting their
manner of life; wherefore, ye dwell in their habitations.
Then these other Stichera, of the martyrs, in the same melody:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
Great is the power of Thy Cross, О Lord! For though it was planted in one
place, it worketh throughout the whole world, making apostles of fishermen and
martyrs of the heathen, that they might pray for our souls.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
Great is the power of Thy martyrs, О Christ; for while lying in their graves
they drive evil spirits away; and, having struggled for piety with their faith in the
Trinity, they abolished the authority of the enemy.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
The prophets, the apostles of Christ and the martyrs enlightened and taught
the erring nations to hymn the consubstantial Trinity, and made the children of
mankind companions of the angels.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Dogmatic Theotokion:
How can we, O all-honored one, * not marvel at thine Offspring? * who is
both God and man. * For without knowing a man, O all-immaculate One, *
without a father thou hast given birth to a Son in the flesh, * who without a
mother was begotten from the Father before all ages, * yet in no way undergoing
change, fusion or separation, * but preserving fully the characteristics of both
natures. * Wherefore, O Lady, and Virgin Mother, * beseech Him to save the
souls of those ** who with Orthodox faith confess thee to be the true Theotokos.
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone VII:
Prokeimenon: O God, my helper art Thou, * and Thy mercy shall go
before me.
Verse: Rescue me from mine enemies, O God, and from them that rise up
against me redeem me.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, these Stichera, in Tone III:
To the Martyrs: Made steadfast by faith, strengthened by hope, and spiritually
united by the love of Thy Cross, О Lord, Thy martyrs put an end to the tyranny
of the enemy and have received crowns; and with the incorporeal ones they pray
on behalf of our souls.
Verse: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, О
Lord.
For the reposed: All things human, which endure not after death, are vain. Our
wealth will not remain, our glory will not go with us upon the way: for when death
cometh, all these things will fade away. Wherefore let us cry out to Christ the
immortal King: Grant rest to our departed brethren, where all who rejoice have
their abode with Thee.
Verse: Their souls * shall dwell among good things.
For the reposed: O race of mankind, why are ye rebellious in vain? Short is the
course on which we run. Life is but smoke, vapor, ashes and dust; No sooner
doth it appear, than it quickly vanisheth. Wherefore let us cry unto Christ the
immortal King: Grant rest to our departed brethren, where all who rejoice have
their abode with Thee.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O Theotokos - holy among women, * thou Mother unwedded: * entreat the
King and God Whom thou didst bear, * that He save us, ** insofar as He is the
Lover of mankind.
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.
FRIDAY NIGHT: TONE III
AT COMPLINE
Canon of Supplication to the Most Holy Theotokos
ODE I
Irmos: He who of old gathered the waters * into one by His divine decree,
* divided the sea for the people of Israel. * For He is our God and
supremely glorious, * to Him alone let us sing, for He hath been glorified.
Having given birth to the Author of salvation and Bestower of life, in a
manner transcending understanding, О pure Birthgiver of God, thou hast thereby
loosed the bonds of the condemnation of Eve our first mother; wherefore, all
creation doth call thee blessed.
From the depths of despair do thou rescue me who am afflicted by cruel
pangs in soul and body, О most holy Virgin, delivering me from all want; for thou
art the wellspring of loving-kindness, О most pure one.
Glory ..., I have cast off the vesture of gladness, falling into sorrow and pain,
and have been cruelly wounded in every place. But go thou before me and deliver
me from the falsehood which assails me, for thou art my refuge and hope, О
Lady.
Now & ever ..., Having acquired thee as a steadfast intercessor, О Bride of
God, I flee to thy protection, praying: Spurn not thy servant, who am weighed
down by many passions, pangs and sorrows, but heal me by thy prayers, О
Mother of God.
ODE III
Irmos: O Most High, Ruler of all, * who out of nothing hath established all
things, * fashioned by Thy Word, * perfected by the Spirit, * confirm me in
Thy love.
Wretch that I am, I find myself in painful perplexity and sorrow, beholding
death following close upon me; wherefore, О most pure one, save me by thy
supplications.
All my life, which hath become corrupt through evil and prodigal works, doth
accuse me and plungeth me into despair. О pure one, save me!
Glory ..., The abyss of thy compassions, О Lady, poured forth everywhere
solely because of thy goodness, doth anoint with rich oil all who ever hymn thee.
Now & ever ..., Thy Son and Lord, receiving thee as from the origin of our
nature, О Bride of God, joineth those who hymn thee by thy prayers.
ODE IV
Irmos: Thou hast shown us steadfast love, O Lord, * for Thou gavest Thine
only-begotten Son over to death for our sake. * Wherefore with
thanksgiving we cry unto Thee, * ‘Glory to Thy power, O Lord!’
All my hope have I placed in thee, О Lady. I pray and fall down before thee
with all my soul: Deliver me from deadly sickness, and lead me up to the life of
salvation, О thou who hast given birth to our Life.
By thy supplications, О pure one, heal me, thy servant who have become
desperate because of grievous and corrupt wounds; for thou hast given birth to
the Physician, our God Who is rich in mercy.
Glory ..., By thy divine enlightenment deliver me who have fallen into cruel
passions and grant me a vesture of gladness, О Virgin who hast caused the Joy
which passeth all understanding to blossom forth.
Now & ever ..., Thou hast been revealed to be another heaven, О pure
Theotokos, who hast ineffably shone forth the Sun of righteousness on earth, by
Whom the everlasting light of divine knowledge hath shone forth.
ODE V
Irmos: I rise at dawn unto Thee, * the Creator of all, * surpassing all
worldly understanding; * for Thy commandments are light, * wherein do
Thou guide me.
Because of my boundless sins I have drawn nigh unto the passions, bringing
about death. О Mother of God, I earnestly beseech thee to become my
deliverance from many evils.
I stretch forth the hands of my soul unto thee, О pure one, for, wretch that I
am, I have been enfeebled by carnal deeds. Yet do thou deliver me from many
wounds, imparting healing unto me.
Glory ..., I have cast off the garments of health and in pain have clothed
myself in a robe of tears. To thee I pray, О Lady: Clothe me again in health!
Now & ever ..., In that thou art the sacred majesty of the martyrs and apostles
and the help of the faithful, О Theotokos, we all glorify thee as is meet.
ODE VI
Irmos: Lead me up from corruption, О Lord my God! * cried Jonah unto
Thee; * and I also cry aloud to Thee: * Deliver me from the abyss of my
many evils, О Savior, * and guide me I pray, to Thy light!
A multitude of pangs hath assailed me because of my boundless offenses,
corrupt as I am, and clothed me in mortality; yet do thou, О Theotokos, deliver
me from them and rescue me from all want.
I have been cast into the abyss of transgressions, pangs and boundless
sorrows, and I can in nowise deliver myself from them; yet, stretching forth thy
hand, О Birthgiver of God, lead me up to salvation.
Glory ..., We know thee to be a steadfast foundation and a mighty help for
those in sorrow, О Theotokos; wherefore, having fled to thy protection, I beseech
thee: Deliver me from grievous misfortunes and from cruel pangs.
Now & ever ..., Let us hymn the divine ark, the Virgin Mother of God, the
furrow which hath put forth the divine Grain whereby the hearts of the faithful
are fed with faith and spiritual famine is brought to an end.
Lord, have mercy, (Thrice).
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Sessional hymn, in Tone III:
Without separating Himself from the divine Essence, and becoming incarnate
within thy womb, God became a man yet remained God, the one Lord, preserving
thee, the Virgin Mother, as immaculate after giving birth as thou wast before
birthgiving. Him do thou earnestly entreat, that He grant us great mercy.
ODE VII
Irmos: As of old Thou didst bedew * the three pious children in the
Chaldean flames, * so also with the radiant fire of Thy divinity * illumine us
who cry to Thee, * ‘Blessed art Thou, O God of our fathers!’
Take pity on me, О Virgin Bride of God, for I have stumbled headlong into
the depths of despair. I entreat thee to be tranquility for me, О most pure one, for
thou art ever a haven of salvation for those in need.
Ineffably, in a manner transcending understanding, thou hast given birth to
Christ, the Wisdom and Power of God; wherefore, as thou art mighty in mercy
and compassionate, grant me thy saving healing, О Theotokos, thou hope of the
faithful.
Glory ..., Having enriched the ends of the earth and granting the sweetness of
incorruption by thy divine birthgiving, free me from corrupting sickness and the
bitter passions, О most glorious Mother of God.
Now & ever ..., Setting thee forth as the mystical door to Himself and the
wondrous helper of those on earth, О pure one, through thee, He hath given to
mankind a portal leading all to eternal life, in that He is compassionate and the
God of all.
ODE VIII
Irmos: The Babylonian furnace burnt not the children, * neither did the fire
of the Godhead consume the Virgin, * wherefore with the faithful children
we cry aloud: * 'Bless ye the Lord, all ye works of the Lord'.
Having accumulated an unfathomable abyss оf transgressions, I am now
drowning, engulfed in sickness, О pure one. Wherefore, stretching forth to me a
helping hand, I pray thee; lead me up from the abyss of pain.
О pure Ever-virgin, all-hymned Theotokos, thou hast been revealed to be the
earthly throne of God and the portal of heaven; wherefore, open unto me the
door of salvation, O Mother of God, and free me from the darkness: of the
passions.
Glory ..., Like a vine thou didst produce the uncultivated Grape, exuding the
wine which maketh glad the souls of those who hymn Him with faith, О pure and
all-immaculate one.
Now & ever ..., Remaining incorrupt after giving birth, О all-immaculate and
pure one we pray: Deliver from corruption thy servants, who faithfully chant with
oneness of soul: Bless the Lord, all ye works, and supremely exalt Him,
throughout the ages!
ODE IX
Irmos: Upon Mount Sinai Moses saw thee In the bush, * as one who didst
conceive the fire of the Godhead within thy womb, * and yet remained
unconsumed. * Daniel saw thee as a mountain not cut by the hand of man,
* and Isaiah proclaimed thee as the Rod that blossomed forth * from the
root of David.
О good Virgin, thou joy and refuge of the world! protection of the faithful and
deliverance from sorrows! Do thou stand before me at the hour of my death, and
deliver me from the demons who seek to destroy me.
In that thou didst conceive the Creator and God within thy womb, О pure
Virgin Mother, by the power which is in thee cast down the arrogance of the
demons and lift up the horn of those who hymn thy divine might and venerate
thine image with faith.
Glory ..., He Who became incarnate from thee, О pure Virgin, restoring our
nature, hath made new and renewed through thy maternal supplications, those
who in hymns unceasingly magnify thee, our radiant and vigilant ally, the
Theotokos.
Now & ever ..., Thou art the joy of the angels, the beauty of the righteous;
thou art the hope of the faithful and our preservation. Thou art the bridge, which
conveyeth to the life which groweth not old, those who magnify thee with faith
and love.
Then, “It is truly meet ...,” and a prostration. Trisagion through Our Father ...,
Troparia, and the rest as usual. Dismissal.

the Sessional hymns of the martyrs, in Tone III:
Your goodly endurance, O all-praised passion-bearers, vanquished the wiles of

blessedness. Intercede, then with the Lord, that He save the flock of Christ-loving
people, in that ye are witnesses to the Truth.
Verse: Wondrous is God in His saints, * the God of Israel.
Through your faith ye shine like most radiant beacons, O physicians of the

unto departed souls, crying: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord!
Glory ..., Cleanse those who have departed unto Thee, О Good Savior, Who
by the spear which pierced Thy side hast torn apart the record of sins and
removed the middle wall of their transgressions; and be Thou well-pleased that,
receiving it, they may chant unto Thee: Bless the Lord, all ye works of the Lord!
Theotokion: О pure Virgin, we know thee to be a noetic cloud for those
burdened by the thirst of mortality, pouring forth the water of remission,
imparting immortality unto all the dead, who ever cry out with faith: Bless the
Lord, all ye works of the Lord!
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX
Canon of All Saints
Irmos: Upon Mount Sinai Moses saw thee In the bush, * as one who didst
conceive the fire of the Godhead within thy womb, * and yet remained
unconsumed. * Daniel saw thee as a mountain not cut by the hand of man,
* and Isaiah proclaimed thee as the Rod that blossomed forth * from the
root of David.
Ye brought yourselves like lambs to Him Who was slain for our sake, and
filled the divine choirs of the angels with joy, О passion-bearers of Christ;
wherefore, by your prayers make all steadfast and deliver them from the harmful
delusion of the enemy.
Possessed of the Word of life, like lamps ye enlightened men’s souls, О most
sacred hierarchs of Christ who share in divine glory; for, having received the fire
of the Spirit, О venerable ones, ye utterly consumed the passions and abolished
the immolation of idolatrous sacrifices.
Let us honor the holy prophets and the multitude of the venerable, who in
their pure life shone forth before the law and under the law; and let us praise the
choirs of holy women, and cry aloud: By their prayers, О Lord, save us all!
For the reposed: Thy burial and resurrection became life for all; wherefore,
with boldness we cry out to Thee: Grant rest with all the elect unto the faithful
whom Thou hast taken to Thyself, forgiving them all their offenses, in that Thou
art the supremely good God.
Theotokion: “Awesome is this place!” Jacob cried aloud when he beheld thee
depicted in the true ladder, О Theotokos, thou glory of the martyrs, boast of the
venerable, adornment of the angels and all the prophets, and salvation of the
faithful.
Canon of the Departed
Irmos: Unto her who was prefigured on Sinai in the bush and the flame *
before Moses the lawgiver, * she who conceived the fire of God within her
womb without being consumed, * the most radiant and inextinguishable
lamp, * the very Theotokos, thee do we honor and magnify with hymns.
Refrain: Wondrous is God in His saints, the God of Israel.
As the only good God and Lover of mankind, by the supplications of the
martyrs grant that those who have passed over to Thee may dwell now in the land
of the meek, granting them remission of sins, that we may unceasingly magnify
Thee with hymns.
Refrain: Grant rest, О Lord, to the souls of Thy departed servants.
О Christ, among Thy holy ones number those whom Thou hast taken to
Thyself in the dwellings of the saints, in the bosom of Abraham, where the
ineffable and divine light of Thy countenance shines, and everlasting joy truly
abides forever.
Glory ..., In a place of verdure, by restful waters, grant Thy blessed life, the
unceasing sustenance of eternal good things, and true gladness, unto Thy servants,
whom of Thy will Thou hast taken to Thy self, О Bestower of life.
Theotokion: Like the holy ark and the tabernacle of witness didst thou, О allimmaculate one, receive within thy womb God thy Creator, the Giver of the law,
Who by His death hath annulled the law of death.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Praises, these Stichera of the martyrs, in Tone III:
Verse: Praise Him for His mighty acts, * praise Him according to the
multitude of His greatness.
To the Martyrs: Come, all ye peoples, let us honor the memory of the holy
passion-bearers. For, having become a spectacle to angels and to men, they have
received crowns of victory from Christ God, and they ever intercede on behalf of
our souls.
Verse: Praise Him with the sound of trumpet, * praise Him with the
psaltery and harp.
The warriors of Christ cast aside the fear of kings and tyrants; and with
courage boldly confessed Him as the Lord and God of all, our God; and now they
intercede on behalf of our souls.
Verse: Praise Him with timbrel and dance, * praise him with strings and
flute.
The hosts of the bodiless angels marveled at the sufferings of the martyrs; For
though clad in mortal flesh, they paid no heed to their tortures, following the
example of Christ the Savior's Passion; and they ever interceding on behalf of our
souls.
Verse: Praise Him with tuneful cymbals, praise Him with cymbals of
jubilation. * Let every breath praise the Lord.
For the reposed: O race of mankind, why are ye rebellious in vain? Short is the
course on which we run. Life is but smoke, vapor, ashes and dust; No sooner
doth it appear, than it quickly vanisheth. Wherefore let us cry unto Christ the
immortal King: Grant rest to our departed brethren, where all who rejoice have
their abode with Thee.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Without seed thou didst conceive by the Holy Spirit; we glorify thee and hymn
thy praises: Rejoice, O most holy Virgin!
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the departed, in Tone III:
Spec. Mel.: “Great is the power of Thy Cross, О Christ ...”:
I glorify Thy precious Cross O Lord, whereby life and blessedness have been
granted to those who with faith and love hymn Thy praises, O greatly merciful
One. Wherefore we cry aloud unto Thee, O Christ God: Grant rest to our
departed brethren, where all who rejoice have their abode with Thee.
Verse: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen * and taken to Thyself, О
Lord.
Repeat: I glorify Thy precious Cross O Lord ..,

О Christ God Who alone art merciful and compassionate, Who hast an
unapproachable abyss of goodness, Who knowest human nature, which Thou
didst create, we beseech Thee: Unto those who have been taken from us grant rest
where all who rejoice have their abode with Thee.
Verse: Their memorial * is from generation to generation.
When Thou didst rest in the tomb as a man, as God Thou didst raise up with
invincible power, those who were sleeping in the graves, and who offer Thee
unceasing hymnody. Wherefore, we beseech Thee, О Christ God: Unto those
who have been taken from among us grant rest where all who rejoice have their
abode with Thee.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
О Theotokos, all of us know thee to be the noetic lamp bearing the Light of
the Godhead, Who had united Himself to the coarseness of human nature.
Entreat thy Son and God, that unto those who have been taken from among us
He grant rest where all who rejoice have jubilation.
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON SATURDAY MORNING: TONE III
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone III:
Thou didst banish from paradise our forefather Adam, who had broken Thy
commandment, О Christ; but Thou didst cause to dwell therein the thief who
confessed Thee on the cross, crying: Remember me, О Savior, in Thy kingdom!
Subjected to wounding by fire, О passion-bearers of Christ, ye found the dew
of heaven which cooled and strengthened you to endure the bitter pangs in your
flesh; wherefore, ye ever ease all the pain of our souls.
The holy and sacred hierarchs, the glorious apostles, the multitude of the
venerable, the council of godly women who faithfully suffered, and set at naught
the deception of the enemy, have received heavenly glory. By their supplications,
О Savior, have pity on Thy servants.
For the reposed: О Jesus our God and Savior, in the abodes of Thine elect
number those who have departed from us in faith where Thy light shineth, and
the sustenance is everlasting, and overlook their offenses, that we may fervently
glorify Thee, О Master.
Glory ..., О ye faithful, let us worship the uncreated Trinity in three
Hypostases but a single Godhead: the Father, the Son and the divine Spirit: Who
is ever glorified with faith by the incorporeal hosts in three sacred ranks.
Now & ever ..., The Redeemer, enlightenment and cleansing of all revealed
Himself through thee, О divinely joyous and most pure Lady. Him do thou
earnestly entreat, that at the dread judgment He deliver from all condemnation us
who ever hymn Him with faith.
