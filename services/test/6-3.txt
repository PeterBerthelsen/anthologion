MONDAY EVENING: TONE VI
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of repentance,
The composition of Joseph, in Tone VI:
Spec. Mel.: “For the wretchedness of life ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
Who doth not weep for me, who in intemperance have broken the
commandment of the Most High? I have come to dwell in Hades instead of
paradise through the sight of the sweet food which brought about death, and
because of it I have become a stranger to life and the glory of God. Yet accept me
the penitent, О Lord, for the sake of Thy great mercy, in that Thou art merciful
and the Lover of mankind.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
Behold my sorrow and pain, and the countless multitude of my transgressions,
the affliction of my soul and the delusion of my mind. Attend unto the cry of one
who is accursed and condemned, О Lord, and grant me a contrite spirit and a
humble heart; and in Thy great mercy give me a wellspring of tears and
forgiveness for my many transgressions.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
О God, Who desirest that all should be saved: Look down and hearken unto
my supplication, and reject not my tears as shed in vain. For who having come to
Thee weeping hath not been saved straightway? Who having cried out fervently
unto Thee hath not been hearkened to straightway? О Master, be Thou quick to
save all who entreat Thee, for Thou art invincible in mercy.
Then the Stichera for the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera for the holy & great John the Forerunner, in the same tone:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
Disdain me not who have strayed from the path of life, О Forerunner of the
Savior. I lift up mine eyes unto Thee, and cry: Set the feet of my soul upon the
rock of repentance; show me how to walk the straight way which leadeth to the
gates of salvation; and reject not the groaning of my sorrowful heart, О thou who
art the greatest of all who have been born.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples,
О Baptist and Forerunner of the Savior: Be thou a helper unto me who have
sunk in the mire of impure thoughts; extend to me the hand which touched the
head of the Incorrupt One; strengthen me that I may valiantly do the works of
repentance, which thou didst preach; and grant that I, thy servant, may enter into
the kingdom, which thou wast the first to proclaim, О blessed one.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
О Baptist of Christ, who by thy birth didst loose thy mother’s barrenness and
thy father’s tongue, rid thou my childless heart of fruitlessness, and quickly
remove all the irrationality of my soul, for thou wast the voice of the Word,
announcing repentance, which do thou grant that I may ever achieve, who in my
slothfulness have withdrawn from God.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
О most holy Virgin, show forth upon me, the wretched one, the depths of thy
love for mankind, the abyss of thy tender compassion, and the countless
compassions of thy goodness. Mow down the stubble of sin, granting me chastity,
and preserve my body and soul undefiled, О thou who hast given birth to the
Savior.
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone IV:
Prokeimenon: The Lord will hearken unto me * when I cry unto Him.
Verse: When I called upon Thee, O God of my righteousness, Thou didst
hearken unto me.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone VI:
At Thy fearful Coming, O Christ, * may we not hear the words: * 'I know you
not.' * For though, O Savior, we have put our trust in Thee, * from negligence we
have not kept not Thy commandments; * yet we entreat Thee, ** do Thou spare
our souls.
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
I have no repentance and I have no tears. * Wherefore I entreat Thee, O
Christ God: * before the end is here * turn me back and grant me compunction, *
that I may be delivered ** from the torments of Hades. 
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: О martyred passion-bearers, citizens of heaven, who suffered
on the earth, ye endured many torments. By their supplications and entreaty, О
Lord, preserve us all.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
No one that fleeth unto thee, O most pure Virgin Theotokos, * departeth
from thee ashamed; * for those that asketh grace of thee, ** ever receiveth a gift
for their profitable petition.
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

command of God consumed the Chaldeans * and prevailed upon the tyrant

The Sessional hymns of repentance, in Tone VI:

to the Judge? О compassionate Father, only-begotten Son and Holy Spirit: Have
mercy on me!
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.
In the vale of weeping, in the place which Thou hast appointed, rebuke me

shame me before the angels; but take pity on me, О God, and have mercy on me.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Open unto us the doors of repentance, О blessed Virgin Theotokos. Let not
those who trust in thee perish, but may we be delivered by thee from misfortunes,
for thou art the salvation of the race of mankind.
After the 2nd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone VI:
О my soul, how long shalt thou labor for sin in despondency; how long shalt
thou, sick, fail to go to the Physician? Arise then from the evils thou hast
committed, and cry unto the Lord, saying: О Savior, Hope of the hopeless and
Life of the despairing, raise me up, and save me?
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.
Grant unto me the vigilance of the wise virgins, О Lord, and enlighten the

angelic hymn: Alleluia!
Verse: Wondrous is God in His saints, * the God of Israel.
To the Martyrs: Having endured the struggle of martyrdom, the saints receive
from Thee the honors of victory; they set at naught the intentions of the
iniquitous, and have received crowns of incorruption. For their sake be Thou
entreated, О God, and grant us great mercy.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O thou good Virgin Theotokos, * the hope of the world, * we beg thine
intercession which alone is mighty: * have compassionate mercy upon us, * a

delivered from every threat, ** O thou who alone art blessed!

“Set your hearts aright for the Lord!”, By thy prayers save my greatly sinful soul,
bring my hardened mind to compunction, and deliver me from the torment to
come, О Forerunner of the Savior.
The tempest of the passions and the cruel threefold waves of transgressions
have drowned me in the depths of despair, О Word; but stretch forth to me Thy
mighty right hand, and save me, as Thou didst Peter, from the depths of my cruel
iniquities, through the supplications of Thy Forerunner.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
The Son and Word of God, Who was begotten of the Father before the ages
without a mother, thou didst bear in times past, incarnate from thy pure blood
without the aid of a man, О Birthgiver of God. Him do thou entreat, that we be
granted remission of sins before the end.
ODE I

Let us chant unto the Lord God, * for He hath been glorified!
The divine angel announced thy birth beforehand to thy father, О angel of
God. With him be thou mindful of us, that on the day of judgment we may find
mercy, О holy Forerunner.
As the beauteous scion of the desert, О Forerunner of Christ, uproot the
slothfulness which continually springs up within me, and cause me to produce the
fruits of repentance.
A childless womb hath most gloriously giveth birth to thee as fruit, showing
hearts which before were unfruitful to be right fertile. But I cry out to thee with
faith: О Baptist, uproot my fruitless thoughts!

hand to me who ever navigates the abyss of evils, О blessed Forerunner.

cast into the inextinguishable fire as barren.
The dread day is at hand, and I am laden with grievous burdens. Lift them
from me, О Baptist of the Lord, by thy pure supplications.

with joyful voices.
ODE IV

rays of miracles ye dispel the gloom of suffering.

ODE V
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: Out of the night I seek Thee early, * enlighten me I pray Thee, O
Lover of mankind, * and guide me in Thy commandments, * and teach me,
O Savior, * to do Thy will.
О Christ, I am Thy slothful servant, who have hidden Thy talant and am
confounded by the evil deeds of my passions; wherefore, send me not into the
fire.
Though I became Thy child through grace, О compassionate Christ, yet I have
enslaved myself to the enemy and have departed from Thee, living prodigally;

this thy holy temple, with fervent prayers we beseech thee: Deliver us from
temptations and tribulations, О all-praised one.

one who walked a strange path in this life: Join me to the Lord of all, making me

God, * and he heard me * from the lowest depths of Hades; * and raised up
my life from corruption.
Let me not be seen as a joy to the demons on the dread day, О Christ Jesus,
lest I then hear the voice sentencing me to the fire of Gehenna.
The enemy of the righteous hath drowned me in the depths of transgressions,
but I flee to the abyss of Thy compassions, О Jesus, crying aloud: Guide me now

Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: The uttermost depths of sin have encompassed me; * and its stormy
waves I can endure no more, * wherefore like Jonah I cry out to Thee, O
Master: * Lead me up from corruption.
Thou didst spring forth as an offshoot of a root, О prophet, showing hearts
barren of all goodly knowledge to be right fruitful for the praise of God.

our noetic footsteps toward the path of peace, О Forerunner.
Surround thy flock with righteousness, О prophet, delivering us from every

before Thee. * We have not kept nor followed * Thy commandments, but

know Thy tender compassion; I know Thy long-suffering and forbearance. Grant

severance of my debts, and ease my heavy burden, that in compunction I may
ever glorify Thee, the God of our fathers.

deny Thee, our living God.
To the Martyrs: Ye were parted from your bodies, yet were shown to be unseparated from God, О martyrs, because of your divine union with Him Who
united Himself to us incorruptibly. Him do ye ever beseech, that we be delivered
from all want.
Theotokion: Without seed thou didst put forth Him Whom the Father began
incorruptibly, and thou didst remain a virgin even after giving birth, as thou wast
before birthgiving. Wherefore, thou art unceasingly blessed and glorified, О most
pure one, as the Mother of God.
Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: In Babylon the Children feared not the fiery furnace; * but cast into
the midst of the flames * they were bedewed and sang: * ‘O Lord God of
our fathers, Blessed art Thou.’
As the voice of the Word, О Baptist, accept now our cries, and deliver thy
people from sufferings and misfortunes, from many evil circumstances and
everlasting torment.
With thy hand thou didst point to the Lamb of God Who taketh away the sins
of the world, О prophet. Him do thou ever beseech, that He take away my
grievous offenses and difficult times, and grant me life.
О my soul, hasten thou and, abandoning the darkness of irrational deeds, cry
out: Have pity on me, О Jesus, through the supplications of the Baptist, and
rescue me from the mire of my deeds!
Theotokion: Unto Him, before Whom the ranks of heaven stand with
trembling, and Who in His goodness united Himself unto mankind, didst thou
give birth, О pure one. Him do thou earnestly entreat, that He have pity on thy
servants.

the Cherubim and Seraphim, * let every breath and all creation * praise,
bless, and supremely exalt, * throughout all ages.
Having sinned more than David, I gaze upon the great mercy of Thy
compassions, О Christ, and with him cry aloud: О only Merciful One, speedily
have mercy upon me!
I pray that mine end may be good, and that I may bring an end to my wicked
deeds. Yet my intention is not sincere, for my heart is hardened. Have pity on me,
О Word of God.
To the Martyrs: О passion-bearers, ye willingly offered yourselves as chosen
and unblemished sacrifices unto the only-begotten Word Who sacrificed Himself
for our sake, abolishing all the sacrifices of the demons.
To the Martyrs: The severing of your tendons, the uprooting of your teeth, the
cutting off of your hands, the fracture of your members, and every other torture
did ye valiantly endure, О martyrs, hymning Christ, the only Judge of the contest.
Theotokion: For us thou hast given birth to the Ancient of days as a little
babe, Who showeth us new paths on earth, renewing our nature which hath
waxed old, О unwedded and blessed one.
Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: Suffering affliction for the sake of the laws of their fathers, * the
blessed Children in Babylon * scorned the foolish decree of the King. * 
Standing together in the midst of the flames, they remained unharmed, *
and sang a song fitting for almighty God: * ‘O ye works of the Lord, praise
ye the Lord * and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages.’
Thou didst behold the Holy Spirit descending in the form of a dove upon the
Word as He was baptized, О blessed one, and wast deemed worthy to hear the
voice of the Father, saying: “This is my Son, Who is co-enthroned with Me, to
Whom all creation doth sing: Hymn the Lord, О ye works, and supremely exalt
Him throughout all ages!”
Having consumed the flammable passions of my mind with the fire of thy
prayers, О prophet, light again the lamp of my heart, which hath gone out, that,
seeing clearly, I may chant unto the Creator of the light of the commandments:
Hymn the Lord, ye works, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!
I am the wretched servant who hid the talant which I received from Thee to
invest. What shall I do when Thou comest to render judgment, trying the deeds of
each man? But have pity on me through the supplications of Thy Forerunner, and
send me not into the fire who cry: Hymn the Lord, О ye works, and supremely
exalt Him throughout the ages!
Theotokion: Maintain my mind in humility, О Maiden full of the grace of
God, who by thy birthgiving hast crushed the uprising of the demons. Raise me
up from the dung-hill of the passions, and with thy grace fill me, who hunger and
chant: Hymn the Lord, О ye works, and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages!
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: Ineffable is the birthgiving * of a seedless conception, * from a
mother who knew not a man; * an undefiled childbearing. * For the birth of
God hath renewed nature, * wherefore all generations rightly worship and
magnify thee * as the Bride and Mother of God.
О Jesus Who lovest mankind, Thou alone knowest our infirmity, for in Thy
tender compassion Thou didst clothe Thyself therein, desiring to cleanse it.
Wherefore, cleanse my wicked defilements and the sores of mine evils, and save
me.
Like the harlot I offer Thee tears, О Lover of mankind; like the publican I cry
out, groaning, unto Thee: Cleanse and save me! And like the Canaanite woman I
exclaim: Have mercy on me, as Thou didst the penitent Peter, and grant me
forgiveness!
To the Martyrs: Wrestling in the flesh with the incorporeal prince of this
world, by your struggles of suffering ye cast him down, and have worthily received
crowns of victory. Wherefore, pray ye earnestly for all who praise you with faith,
О holy ones.
To the Martyrs: With the holy blood of Thy saints Thou didst sanctify the
earth, О Lord, uniting their spirits to the spirits of the holy hosts, О most Holy
One; and by them Thou dost ever sanctify those who hallow Thee with true faith.
Theotokion: We offer unto thee the cry of the archangel, О all-pure and
blessed one: Rejoice, thou who contained the uncontainable God! Rejoice,
annulment of the curse and induction of blessing! Rejoice, thou who alone
openest the gate of paradise!
Canon of the Forerunner
Irmos: Come, ye faithful, let us raise our minds on high * and enjoy the
Master’s hospitality * and the table of immortal life in the upper room; *
and let us hear the exalted teaching of the Word * Whom We magnify.
Cure thou my mind, which hath been grievously infected by the love of life’s
pleasures, still the tempest which vexeth me greatly, and show me the straight
ways of repentance, О Forerunner of the Lord.
Thou wast seen standing between the Old and the New Covenants, О
prophet, causing the former to cease and revealing the latter as light. Quickly
guide us to walk therein with a godly conscience, that we may be delivered from
everlasting darkness.
The dread judgment will be a day full of wrath, a day of darkness for those
whose works are dark, О Baptist and Forerunner of Christ. By thy prayers deliver
us from all condemnation then, for we honor thee.
Theotokion: Thou wast shown to be holier than the cherubim, О Virgin, for
thou hast given birth to the supremely holy God. Sanctify us all, who day and
night hallow thee with holy voices and faith.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone VI:
Finding me naked, and stripped of virtues, * the enemy hath wounded me with
the arrow of sin; * but, do Thou as the Physician of both soul and body, * heal the
wounds of my soul O God, ** and have mercy upon me.
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
The wounds of my heart, * inflicted on me by my many sins, * do Thou heal
O Savior, * as Thou art the Physician of both soul and body, * for Thou dost
always grant the forgiveness of sins * unto those that ask it of Thee. * O Lord
grant me tears of repentance and remission of debts, ** and have mercy upon me.
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: О Lord, if we did not have Thy saints as advocates * and in
Thy goodness having mercy upon us, * how would we dare to hymn Thee, Whom
the angels glorify without ceasing. ** О Thou Who knowest the hearts of men,
spare our souls!
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Thou wast deemed worthy of great gifts, * O pure Virgin Mother of God, *
for thou didst give birth in the flesh * to One of the Holy Trinity, * Christ, the
Giver of life, ** unto the salvation of our souls.
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON TUESDAY MORNING: TONE VI
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone VI
Remember me, О God my Savior, when Thou shalt come in Thy kingdom,
and save me, in that Thou alone lovest mankind.
О Christ Who accepted the lamentation of Peter, accept also my repentance;
and grant me forgiveness of mine offenses.
О Baptist and Forerunner of the Lord, who preached repentance to mankind,
pray that I may repent with all my soul.
Martyricon: Having endured threefold waves of sufferings, О passionbearers, ye now heal the infirmities of all; wherefore, ye are called blessed.
Glory ..., О Thou Who by the prophets art glorified in the simple and
uncommingled Trinity, save me by the supplications of the Forerunner!
Now & ever ..., О mighty intercession for those who find themselves amid
tribulations, intercede for me, who partake of the pleasures of life, and save me, I
pray thee.
On Tuesday, the Prokeimenon in Tone VII:
Prokeimenon, in Tone VII: The righteous man shall be glad in the Lord *
and shall hope in Him.
Verse: Hearken, O God, unto my prayer, when I make supplication unto Thee.
Alleluia, in Tone IV: The righteous man shall flourish like a palm tree, and
like a cedar in Lebanon shall he be multiplied.
Verse: They that are planted in the house of the Lord, in the courts of our
God they shall blossom forth.
Communion Verse: In everlasting remembrance shall the righteous be; he
shall not be afraid of evil tidings.
