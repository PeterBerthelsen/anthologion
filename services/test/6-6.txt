ODE I
Irmos: When Israel walked on foot in the sea as on dry land, * on seeing
their pursuer Pharaoh drowned, * they cried: * Let us sing to God * a song
of victory.
О Virgin, accept mine entreaty, which I make bold to offer to thee from an
unworthy mouth and defiled lips; and shine thou the light of compunction upon
thy servant, О pure one.
By thy prayers grant me showers of tears, О pure Virgin Mother, that I may
weep fervently for what I have done on earth, and through thee may escape every
torment.
Glory ..., Reject not my lamentation, О thou who hast given birth to the
Source of tender compassion, but look upon me with thy merciful eye, О good
Theotokos, and cure the passions of my soul.
Now & ever ..., Weep with groaning, О my soul, and bewail thyself in every
way, falling down before the Mother of God and saying: Deliver me, the guilty
one, from dreadful torment!
ODE III
Irmos: There is none as holy as Thou, * O Lord my God, * who hast
exalted the horn of The faithful O good One, * and strengthened us upon
the rock * of Thy confession.
There is none that hath sinned as I have, becoming a slave to the evils of
unbridled thoughts, О most holy and pure one; but, placing my hope in thee, I
pray: Rescue me from them.!
Behold, all the evils of the enemy that have rained upon me like wounds,
weigh me down; rendering me fetid and causing my soul to fall.
Glory ..., Many are my transgressions; wherefore, falling down before thee
with faith, О most holy one, I, the lowly one, cry aloud: At the dread hour entreat
Him to Whom thou hast given flesh.
Now & ever ..., О holy Theotokos, as thou hast maternal boldness before
God, rescue me who am deserving of all condemnation, and make me to dwell in
His dwelling-place.
ODE IV
Irmos: Christ is my power, * my God and my Lord, * the holy Church
divinely singeth, * crying with a pure mind, * keeping festival in the Lord.
Grant me a wellspring of tears, О Lady, that I may wash away the defilement
of my lowly soul and regain the beauty which I have lost through the lying counsel
of the serpent.
О my compassionate God, О God Who lovest mankind and willest mercy,
pour forth Thy mercy now upon me; for Thy Mother, my hope and ally,
entreateth Thee.
Glory ..., Taking pity, О most immaculate one, save me, the terrible prodigal
one, who have mindlessly and shamelessly sinned against thee; and free me from
Gehenna.
Now & ever ..., Having given birth to the Life of all, thou hast destroyed the
field of death; wherefore, I cry out to thee: I have sinned! Save me, by thy
maternal supplications, О pure one!
ODE V
Irmos: Illumine with Thy divine light, I pray, O Good One, * the souls of
those who with love rise early to pray to Thee, * that they may know Thee,
O Word of God, * as the true God, * Who recalleth us from the darkness of
sin.
О pure one, have mercy on me who have placed all my hope in thee, and take
pity, overlooking all the grievous passions of my soul, for I cry out to thee with
faith.
Save me from the passions, from tribulation and harm, and from the wicked
adversaries; and deliver my lowly soul from their treachery, О Virgin, that they
may not say: We have prevailed over him!
Glory ..., Having been revealed to be pure in body and soul, О most pure one,
free thou my soul from defilement, granting me to live a pure life; and guide me in
doing the divine will of the Lord.
Now & ever ..., Thee alone do I have as a refuge and my reconciliation with
God, I who have wasted my whole life in many transgressions.
ODE VI
Irmos: Beholding the sea of life surging with the tempest of temptations, *
I run to Thy calm haven, and cry to Thee: * Raise up my life from
corruption, * O Most Merciful One.
О Lady, accept my sighs and the lifting up of my hands as a sacrifice of sweet
savor, and grant that I may behold thy countenance with a pure conscience.
Disdain not my words of supplication, О good Lady, Mother of the merciful
God Who shone forth from thy womb; but before the end grant me divine
remission.
Glory ..., Utter wretch that I am, through fornication I have brought myself
low and estranged myself from God. But do thou beseech Him to save me, О
good one, for to thee have I fled. Clothe me in my former vesture.
Now & ever ..., Jesus, Who is fire, did not consume thy womb when He issued
forth from thee in the flesh, pray thou to Him, О pure one, that He deliver from
fire and all manner of torment those who hymn thee with faith.
Lord, have mercy, (Thrice).
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Sessional hymn, in Tone VI:
О pure and glorious Virgin, thou glory of the angels, who alone art blessed:
when thou didst stand at the foot of the Cross of thy Son and God, unable to
endure the malice of the enemy thou didst cry aloud, lamenting with sighs: How
can He Who is the Lover of mankind endure the abuse of these men?
ODE VII
Irmos: In Babylon the Children feared not the fiery furnace; * but cast into
the midst of the flames * they were bedewed and sang: * ‘O Lord God of
our fathers, Blessed art Thou.’
O my soul, awake from all the evils thou hast committed! Why sleepest thou
still? Wherefore liest thou in the slumber of despondency? Cry aloud to the
Theotokos: О all-holy one, help me!
I venerate the image of thy countenance, yet I dare not lift mine eyes unto
thee, О most holy one. I pray that I may receive the forgiveness of my debts, and
that in purity I may behold thy most pure icon.
Glory ..., To thine aid, О Birthgiver of God, do I flee and fall prostrate,
begging to receive forgiveness. Disdain me not, О Lady, but taking pity, save me.
Now & ever ..., I have defiled my soul and mind with the many and various
evils of the corrupter of souls, О most pure one, and I beseech thee: Disdain not
thy servant, but rescue me from his temptations.
ODE VIII
Irmos: Suffering affliction for the sake of the laws of their fathers, * the
blessed Children in Babylon * scorned the foolish decree of the King. *
Standing together in the midst of the flames, they remained unharmed, *
and sang a song fitting for almighty God: * ‘O ye works of the Lord, praise
ye the Lord * and supremely exalt Him throughout all ages.’
Having sinned beyond measure and defiled my body with sins, fool that I am,
I consider the day of inexorable judgment, and at a loss and afraid, I am filled with
fear and trembling, and fall down before thy compassion, О Lady. Spurn me not,
but behold my sorrow, and deliver me from all condemnation and the many and
varied torments.
Having spurned the divine law, wretch that I am, I lie wholly in slothfulness.
But, looking upon me, arise quickly, О most pure one, and cause me to receive the
portion of the saved; that, rejoicing, I may cry unto thee: Rejoice, О joy of the
world, only intercessor for those who with faith invoke thy steadfast protection.
Glory ..., Woe is me, О my soul! How can I stand, in fear and trembling,
before the dread tribunal, where even the angels shall be afraid and quake? But, as
thou hast the Theotokos as a good ally, bend thy knees and lift up thy hands,
crying: Direct thy merciful gaze upon me and have pity in that hour, О Virgin!
Now & ever ..., Show forth now the sure might of thine aid, for like one in thy
debt, thy Son is moved by thy maternal pleas, О Virgin. Wherefore, come now in
mine hour of need, that I not depart unprepared, but may live on, О all-hymned
and pure Theotokos.
ODE IX
Irmos: Weep not for Me, O Mother, * beholding in the tomb the Son Whom
thou hast conceived * without seed in the womb; * for I shall arise and shall
be glorified, * and as God I shall exalt with glory unceasing, * those that
with faith and love magnify thee.
That I may receive the glory of heaven, I pray to thee, О Virgin: Absolve me,
and deliver me from the debts of darkness, overlooking all that I have committed
in knowledge or in ignorance, day or night, О most pure one; that, rejoicing, I may
offer thee a hymn of thanksgiving.
Rescue me from all manner of tribulations, О Maiden, and set my feet upon
the rock of divine salvation; for, having acquired thee now as an invincible
intercessor, I trust that I may pass freely through the wall of separation erected by
disobedience when the fruit of the tree was eaten.
Glory ..., I beseech thee, who hast given birth to the merciful Judge and
Master: accept the boldness of my defiled lips and my wretched hymnody, and
abhor me not, though I have sinned more than all others; for I, thy servant, have
thee as my helper after God.
Now & ever ..., In that thou art more exalted than all creatures, thou didst
conceive in thy womb the incarnate God, О Theotokos. Him do thou earnestly
entreat, О pure one, that He release thy servant from all care, that I may freely
glorify thee with praise.
Then, “It is truly meet ..., ” and a prostration. Trisagion through Our Father...
Troparion, and, the rest as usual. Dismissal.

midst of the earth.
О Lord, the Jews condemned to death Thee, the Life of all; they who crossed
the Red Sea by the staff of Moses nailed Thee to the Cross; they who sucked

through our first mother’s tasting of the tree; but it hath been restored by thee, О

Irmos: Same as the foregoing.
The enemy of old beguiled me through deception, with the desire for

ODE VI
Canon of the Cross
Irmos: Jonah was caught but not held * in the belly of the whale; * for,

have forsaken your own mercy."

cry out: О God our Redeemer, blessed art Thou!
ODE VIII
Canon of the Cross

Irmos: Same as the foregoing.
Thou hast now been foreseen by the divine Daniel as the unquarried
mountain, О Maiden, for from thee alone Christ the Rock was cut, without the
hand of man, О Virgin. Bless Him ye children; praise Him О priests; supremely
exalt Him ye people, throughout all ages!
With hymns the heavenly warriors ever glorify thy birthgiving, О pure, Evervirgin Maiden, and with us they joyously hymn thee as the Mother of God, whom
the children bless, the priests praise, and the people supremely exalt throughout all
ages.
With the rays of thy light, О pure Theotokos Mary, make radiant those who
now acknowledge thee to be the true Theotokos; for thou, О Virgin, wast
revealed to be the habitation of Light for those who cry out with faith: Rejoice, О
blessed and exceedingly glorious one, throughout all ages!
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX
Canon of the Cross
Irmos: Weep not for Me, O Mother, * beholding in the tomb the Son Whom
thou hast conceived * without seed in the womb; * for I shall arise and shall
be glorified, * and as God I shall exalt with glory unceasing, * those that
with faith and love magnify thee.
That Thou mightest deliver from corruption him who became corrupt by
eating of the sweet fruit of the tree, О only Savior, Thou wast crucified in the
flesh and deigned to die, in that Thou art good. О Jesus, we unceasingly hymn
Thy great tender compassion and power.
О how didst Thou endure pain, stretched out upon the Cross, releasing me
from cruel pangs, О Savior? How didst Thou, Who wast crowned with thorns,
burn up all the thorns of my passions? How hast Thou, Who drank vinegar,
mixed for us the cup of gladness?
To the Martyrs: Cast and held fast in prisons, your members cruelly severed,
grievously stretched on the wheel, and thrown to the wild beasts as food, О all ye
spiritual athletes, ye did not deny Christ, the Master of all.
To the Martyrs: The all-radiant and right renowned memory of the spiritual
athletes shineth forth more brightly than the rays of the sun: ever enlightening the
souls of the pious, driving away the darkness of passions and temptations, and
dispelling the most profound gloom of the demons.
Theotokion: Thou hast borne Him Who beareth all things, and held in thine
hands, as a babe, Him Who hath delivered us from, the hand of the adverse foe,
О most pure Lady; and thou didst behold Him Who hath delivered us from the
yoke of evil, lifted up upon the tree of the Cross.
Canon of the Theotokos
Irmos: Same as the foregoing.
Unto us thou hast supra-naturally appeared as the Mediatress of everlasting joy
and life, О pure Birthgiver of God, for thou hast given birth to the Savior of all,
Who clearly wipeth ever tear from every mortal face, granting joy to all.
Chanting, David, thine ancestor, foretold thee in signs as the ark, and Moses as
the golden jar of the divine Manna, О Theotokos; for thou alone didst contain
Him Who is ever in the bosom of the Father. Wherefore, we glorify thee with
hymns.
Thou wast truly more highly exalted than all creation, for thou hast given birth
unto God in the flesh; wherefore, О Lady, we, who hope to receive salvation
through thee, have thee as an intercessor, a sure hope and a firm bulwark.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of the Cross, in Tone VI:
I trust in the Cross, О Christ, and, boasting therein, I cry aloud: О Lord Who
lovest mankind, cast down the pride of those who do not confess Thee to be both
God and man!
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
Protected by the Cross, we array ourselves against the enemy, undaunted by
his wiles and treachery; for the prideful one hath been trampled underfoot by the
power of Christ Who was nailed upon the Tree.
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
To the Martyrs: All creation doth celebrate the memory of Thy saints, О Lord:
the heavens rejoice with the angels, and the earth with all mankind is made merry.
By their prayers have mercy on us.
Glory ..., Now & ever ...,
Stavrotheotokion: “As a man I was nailed to the Tree and died; as one mortal
I was placed in a tomb. But as God I shall rise again in glory on the third day, О
pure Virgin Mother. ”
Then, “It is good to give thanks ...,” Trisagion ..., Our Father ..., Troparia.
Litany: Have mercy on us ..., First Hour, and Dismissal.
ON FRIDAY MORNING: TONE VI
AT LITURGY
On the Beatitudes, these Troparia, in Tone VI
Remember me, О God my Savior, when Thou shalt come in Thy kingdom,
and save me, in that Thou alone lovest mankind.
Stretching forth Thy hands upon the Tree, Thou didst embrace the nations,
who hymn Thy tender compassion, О Christ our God.
Thou wast willingly nailed to the Tree, and by Thy power didst perfectly break
the sting of the prideful one, О Christ.
To the Martyrs: Delighting in your torments, О passion-bearers, ye have been
deemed worthy of the delights of paradise, praying unceasingly on behalf of the
world.
Glory ..., Rescue us, Thy servants, from all torment, О Lord - Father, Son, and
co-enthroned Spirit.
Now & ever ..., Seeing Thee stretched out upon the Cross, the Virgin sighed,
weeping. By her prayers save us, О Lord.
