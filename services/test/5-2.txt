SUNDAY EVENING: TONE V
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of repentance, in Tone V:
Spec. Mel.: “Rejoice ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
I weep and am downcast, envisioning the dread sentence of the Word, for
which I, a wretch, have not the least reply for my guilt. Wherefore, I pray: Before
the unseemliness of mine end overtaketh me, before I am mowed down by death,
before I must needs be condemned to the place where the fire is unquenchable
and the darkness is absolute, where are the worm and gnashing of teeth, and
sinners are consumed, О my Christ, grant me great mercy and deliverance from
mine offenses.
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
Disdaining Thy laws and the Scriptures, wretch that I am, I have rejected Thy
commandments, О God my Creator. How will I ever avoid the torment which is
to come, О Savior! Wherefore, before mine end grant me forgiveness and a
shower of tears, imparting true compunction to me, О Savior. As Thou art the
supremely good God, drive far from me the hordes of the demons who seek to
drag me down into the abyss of Hades, for I entreat Thee: Take not Thine
almighty hand from me!
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
Woe is me! How have I been darkened in mind? How have I withdrawn from
Thee and, wretch that I am, enslaved myself to sin; and, enslaved to the passions,
given myself wholly over to carnal pleasure which liveth within me, who am
passion-fraught? Now I await my departure from this life and the coming
reckoning. О supremely good Lord, grant me tearful repentance and release from
my countless transgressions, for with faith I beseech Thee Who grantest the world
great mercy.
Then the Stichera for the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera of the incorporeal ones, in Tone V:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
О honorable initiates of the mysteries of the Godhead, the thrice-radiant and
consubstantial Divinity, who, unceasingly offering up hymnody with incorporeal
mouths and fiery tongues, bear our supplications and prayers, which we utter with
defiled lips, and who ask for remission of sins: He. Who assumed our nature and
is merciful by nature doth accept your pleas on behalf of His sinful servants,
granting great mercy to the world.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
О ye whole multitude of the angels, who draw nigh to my Master and stand
with fear before His divine throne, full of ineffable light; guide me to the light of
salvation for I have gone astray in the darkness of sin, and at the command of our
compassionate God dispel the dark and alien gloom of the crafty demons with
your help and grace; for they cannot endure, and are driven away, by the coming
of light.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
О radiant angels of God, standing before the divine throne of grace, receiving
humility and true enlightenment from the divine light: Look down on us from the
heavens, О ye who love mankind, for we are beset by the storm of evils, and are
afflicted and sleep in darkness. Wherefore, come to our aid, О archangels, and
deliver us from the snares of the enemy, the author of evil; for we all flee to your
protection, О all-praised ones.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Thou art truly higher than the throne of the cherubim, for the divine Word
made His abode within thee, О pure one, desiring to restore our image; and
issuing forth from thee as mortal, in that He is full of tender compassion, He
endured the Cross and suffering for our sake, and as God hath given us the
resurrection. Wherefore, giving thanks to the Creator with faith, we beseech thee
as the one who transformed our condemned nature, that we may receive forgiveness of transgressions and great mercy by your prayers.
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone VIII:
Prokeimenon: Behold now, bless ye the Lord, * all ye servants of the Lord.
Verse: Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of
our God.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone V:
O Lord, I cease not to sin, nor do I perceive Thy love for mankind which
Thou hast granted me. Vanquish my lack of discernment, O Thou Who alone art
good, and have mercy on me.
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
O Lord, from reverent fear of Thee I tremble, yet I cease not from committing
sins. Who, when called to trial, doth not fear the judge? Or who, desiring to be
healed, angereth the physician, as I do? O longsuffering Lord, have compassion
upon my weakness, and have mercy on me.
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: Not caring for all earthly things, and manfully braving
tortures, ye were not disappointed in your goodly hopes, but became inheritors of
the kingdom, of heaven, О all-praised martyrs. Having boldness before God the
Lover of mankind, ask peace for the world and great mercy for our souls.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O strange, awesome and great mystery! * The Un-circumscribable One hath
made His abode within a womb, * and a Mother remaineth a Virgin even after
birthgiving, * for from her she gave birth to God Incarnate. * To Him, then, let us
cry aloud, * to Him let us raise a hymn, * chanting with the angels: * Holy art
Thou, O Christ God, * Who wast incarnate for our sake! ** Glory be to Thee!
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

AT COMPLINE
Canon of Supplication to the Most holy Theotokos

Irmos: Christ, who with an upraised arm * bringeth wars to naught, * hath
shaken horse and rider in the Red Sea; * but Israel hath He saved * as they
chanted a song of victory.
A truly awesome miracle was wrought within thee, О Virgin, for thou didst
bear in thy womb Him Who is in nowise circumscribed, and hast ineffably given
birth to Him, remaining a virgin.
Rain down remission of sins upon me, О Lady who didst ineffably contain the
Rain of heaven which came upon thee.
Glory ..., О only blessed and divinely joyous one who hast given birth to
ineffable Joy for al mankind: take the grief away from my soul, I pray, and gladden
my heart.

all the desire and sweetness of life, О most immaculate one. Him do thou
beseech, that He save me who now unceasingly glorifies thee.

and suspended it unsupported; * do Thou establish Thy Church on the
unshakeable rock of Thy commandments, O Christ, * who alone art good *
and the Lover of mankind.
The works of the law have passed by as though they were a shadow; for Thou,
О most pure one, hast given birth unto Christ Who in place of the law hath
appointed for us the grace of purification and enlightenment, and hath lifted the
curse, О all-immaculate Virgin.
God was born in the flesh from thee, О pure one; He Who before was
invisible became visible. Wherefore, earnestly entreat Him, О Maiden, that He
deliver me who glorifies thee with splendor, from enemies visible and invisible.
Glory ..., Cruel waves of the passions assail me, the abyss of evil spirits besets
me, and the tempest of sin troubles my heart. О Birthgiver of God, make me
steadfast, for I hymn thee with splendor.
Now & ever ..., Having the divine Gabriel as our commander, with faith we
cry out reverently together to the Theotokos and Mother who knewest not
wedlock. By her we have been delivered from tribulations, sorrows and infirmities.
ODE IV
Irmos: Habbakuk, prophetically apprehending * Thy divine self-emptying,
O Christ, * cried out to Thee with trembling: * Thou hast come for the
salvation of Thy people; * to save Thine anointed Ones.
О Virgin who within thyself wove a robe of incorruption with thy virginal
blood for Him Who clothes the sky with clouds, clothe me who before was
stripped naked through deception.
Thy womb, О Virgin, became a holy and ineffable palace for God the King, in
which He made His abode; whereby He hath made us temples.
Glory ..., As thou art compassionate, have compassion on my most wretched
soul, О all-immaculate Birthgiver of God, for it hath been cruelly darkened and
fettered by the passions and sin.
Now & ever ..., Thou didst shine forth the Scepter of the kingdom of
incorruption from the root of Jesse, О pure one, and without knowing a man
thou hast given birth to a Babe, the God of David, the Creator and Lord.
ODE V
Irmos: O Thou Who hast clothed Thyself in light as with a garment, * I rise
early unto Thee and cry out to Thee: * Enlighten my darkened soul, O
Christ, * in that Thou alone art compassionate!
Even after giving birth thou hast remained an incorrupt virgin, О most
immaculate one; leading all the corrupt toward Life, and illumining them with
incorruption.
To the Pre-eternal One, Who shone forth timelessly from the Father, thou
hast given birth as a newborn Babe, О most pure one. Him do thou entreat on
behalf of the world, О Bride of God.
Glory ..., О let me find thee, О Virgin, to be my helper, rescuing me from the
sentence of the Judge at the hour of judgment, when I shall stand before the
tribunal of Him Who was born from thee.
Now & ever ..., О Virgin Bride of God, my beloved from out of Lebanon,
wholly beautiful and immaculate art thou. By the Holy Spirit the incarnation of
the Son of God was made known in thee.
ODE VI
Irmos: Calm the raging sea of the passions, * O Master Christ, * with its
soul-destroying tempest, * and lead me up from corruption * in that Thou
art compassionate.
Without knowing a man, thou hast given birth to Emmanuel, Who hath taken
pity on our lowliness, О Theotokos; wherefore, we ever glorify thee as is meet.
O most holy one, in a manner transcending understanding and past all telling,
thou hast given birth to the Timeless One, the Creator Who delivereth from all
corruption those who hymn thee, the Theotokos.
Glory ..., Having given birth to the Benefactor and Creator, О most holy and
right-beloved Lady, bless thou mine afflicted soul.
Now & ever ..., О all-pure one, we offer thee praise both new and old; for we
have naught better for thy praise than “Rejoice!”, which we sing to thee with
Gabriel.
Lord, have mercy, (Thrice).
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Sessional hymn, in Tone V:
I lament for myself before the judgment, pondering mine evil and grievous
deeds, and the abyss of transgressions which hath surrounded me from my youth
and which drown my mind; yet by thy prayers, О pure one, grant me remission,
and vouchsafe that I may receive salvation.
ODE VII
Irmos: The supremely exalted Lord of our fathers * quenched the flame, *
and bedewed the Youths * as they chanted in harmony: * O God, blessed
art Thou!
Deliver me from evil despondency, from the darkness of the passions and
everlasting condemnation, О most pure one, that I may glorify thee with faith.
Mortify my passions, О thou who hast given birth to Life, and lift me up who
lie in the grave of senselessness, О Bride of God, that I may glorify thee with love.
Glory ..., О most immaculate one, thou hast given birth to the incorporeal
God clad in the flesh, Who doth deliver us who chant with fear: Blessed art Thou,
О God!
Now & ever ..., Finding thy pure supplication to be priceless healing, О Virgin,
chanting, we ask of thee goodly transformation of soul and health of body.
ODE VIII
Irmos: Unto Thee the Fashioner of all, * the children in the furnace
chanted a hymn: * All ye works of the Lord, * supremely exalt Him
throughout all ages.
О portal of the Light, open unto me the radiant gates of repentance, showing
forth each straight path of righteousness leading into the entries of God’s will.
О Virgin Mother, thou hast given birth on earth to a newborn Child, the Son
Who is co-beginningless with the Father, Who in His ineffable loving-kindness
became like unto us who have become corrupt through sin.
Glory ..., О most glorious Ever-Virgin whom God hath loved and chosen,
thou hast been revealed to be wholly elect, wholly all-adorned; wherefore, we
hymn thee throughout the ages, О pure one.
Now & ever ..., “Thou art wholly pure, full of divine glory, my dear one!” the
Spirit of God said, proclaiming thee, О most pure one, whom we praise with
hymns, chanting: Thou must needs rejoice, having given birth unto the God-man!
ODE IX
Irmos: O Isaiah, rejoice and be glad! * The Virgin hath conceived in her
womb, * and hath borne a Son, Emmanuel, * who is both God and man; *
and Orient is His name; * Him we magnify, and the Virgin we call blessed.
Disdain not the sighs of those who now hasten unto thee, О all-pure one, but
look upon us who are in sorrows, and transform our lamentation into joy, and our
compunction into gladness, for we praise thee in hymns.
Thou art an immovable foundation, О pure one, having given birth to the
Savior Who founded the earth upon the waters by His divine commands. Pray
thou that He splendidly establishes thereon those who call thee blessed.
Glory ..., Thy birthgiving transcends understanding О Theotokos, for
conception and a virginal birth took place within thee without the aid of a man;
for it was God Who was born, and magnifying Him, we bless thee who gave birth
to Him.
Now & ever ..., Awesome art Thou, О Lord. Who then can withstand Thy
threat, О Christ, only King, when Thou shalt render judgment? Wherefore, have
pity and save me, О Savior, through the right acceptable supplications of her who
gave birth to Thee.
Then, “It is truly meet ...,” and a prostration. Trisagion through Our Father ...,
Troparion, and the rest as usual. Dismissal.

The Sessional hymns of repentance, in Tone V:
When the Judge taketh His seat and the angels stand before Him, when the
trumpet sounds and the flame is kindled, what shalt thou do, О my soul, when
thou art brought to judgment? For then thine evils will confront thee, and thy
secret sins will be exposed. Wherefore, before the end cry out to the Judge:
Cleanse me, О God, and save me!
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.
Let us all keep vigil and greet Christ with a multitude of oil and radiant lamps,
that we may be deemed worthy to enter the bridal-chamber; for he who findeth
himself outside the gates crieth unto God in vain: Have mercy on me!
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O Theotokos, in truth we confess thee * to be worthy of all praise; * truly
higher than the heavens * and more holy than the Cherubim. * Through thee we
sinners gain salvation * and find protection in temptations! * cease not to
intercede on our behalf, ** for thou art a strong support and refuge for our souls!
After the 2nd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone V:
O my soul, the things here on earth are transitory, but the things of the life to
come are eternal. I envision the tribunal and the throne of the Judge, and I
tremble at the thought of giving answer. Wherefore, turn thou with haste, for the
judgment is inexorable.
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.
I lie upon the bed of mine offenses, robbed of my hope of salvation; for the
dreaming of my slothfulness winneth torment for my soul. О God Who wast
born from the Virgin, raise me up to Thy hymnody, that I may glorify Thee.
To the Martyrs: Wondrous is God in His saints, * the God of Israel.
The memory of the passion-bearers shineth forth today, for it possesseth
radiance from the heavens. The choirs of angels keep festival, and the race of
mankind celebrates with them. Wherefore, they entreat the Lord, that our souls
find mercy.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O Theotokos, thou who art of heaven with the angels * and of the earth with
mankind, * we cry out to thee with a call of joy: * Rejoice, gate wider than the
heavens! * Rejoice, thou who alone art the salvation of those born on earth! *
Rejoice, O pure one, full of grace, * who hast given birth unto God incarnate.
After the 3rd chanting of the Psalter, the Sessional hymns, in Tone V:
Spec. Mel.: “The co-beginningless Word ...”:
О Savior, summon me as Thou didst the prodigal, for I am weighed down
with irrational passions and have wasted my life in prodigality; do Thou accept
me, and extend to me thy fatherly embrace in the loving-kindness of Thy
compassions; and by the prayers of the incorporeal ones grant unto me mine
ancient dignity.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O fervent and invincible intercessor, * diligent and unashamed hope, *
rampart, protection and haven * of those who have recourse to thee, * O pure
Ever-virgin do thou, together with the angels, * entreat thy Son and God, ** that
He grant peace, salvation and great mercy to the world.

chanted a song of victory.
О ye angels, initiates of the life-giving Godhead, shining with the light of His
first- revealed rays, entreat the Master, that He illumine my soul with light. (Twice)

commanders, captains of the ranks of heaven, from misfortunes deliver those who
piously hymn you.

high, and Who showest forth Thine incalculable goodness: Through their
intercessions make steadfast Thy Church, О only Good One, and Lover of
mankind. (Twice)
Adorning the angels with ineffable radiance, and by them making Thy Church
steadfast, О loving Christ, thereby enlighten my wretched soul, I pray Thee, О
Master, remembering not my countless sins.

ODE IV
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: The works of Thy dispensation, O Lord, * filled the prophet
Habakkuk with wonder, * for Thou hast come to bring salvation to Thy
people, * and to save all Thine anointed ones.
The works I have done in this life are wicked and grievous. О Christ my God:

thongs, badly wounded with stripes and raked with iron claws, Thy spiritual

life of the incorporeal ranks; and let us give wings to our mind.

Let us diligently restore our souls and drink in showers of compunction, that
we may produce the grain of repentance.
To the Martyrs: Sharpened with the coals of love, О passion-bearers, ye were

of the Virgin, and cleanse me of all my sins. I beseech Thee to grant me the
thought of turning back unto Thee, for Thou alone art the Lover of mankind, and
have mercy on me.
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
Woe is me, to whom am I like? I am like the barren fig tree, and I fear that I
shall be cursed and cut down. But, do Thou O heavenly Husbandman, make my
barren soul fruitful, O Christ God, and receive me as the Prodigal Son, and have
mercy on me.
Verse: And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the
works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, * yea, the work of our
hands do Thou guide aright.
Blessed is the army of the King of heaven, for though the passion-bearers
were mortals, yet they strove to attain the dignity of the angels; and spurning the
pangs of their bodies, by their sufferings they were deemed worthy of the honor
of the incorporeal ones. Wherefore, by their prayers, О Lord, send down upon us
great mercy.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O thou who art full of grace, * intercede by thy supplications, * and beg that a
multitude of compassions be granted to our souls * and the cleansing of our many
sins, ** we entreat thee.

Believing Thee to be God, the thief on the cross confessed Thee, О Christ, in
purity from the depths of his heart, crying out: Remember me, О Lord, in Thy
kingdom!
I have met with soul-corrupting thieves on the path of life, and they have
wounded me. But now I flee to thy loving-kindness, О Christ. Heal and save me, I
pray.
The choirs of heaven hymn Thee, the God of all. By their sacred mediation
overlook my many evils, О Master, and save me, I pray.
To the Martyrs: Having joined the angelic choirs, and been filled with neverwaning light, О spiritual athletes of Christ, dispel ye the fetid passions of my heart.
Glory ..., О ye mortals, unto God Who is hymned by the angels in the highest
let us chant the thrice-holy hymn: Holy art Thou, О beginningless Father, Son and
Spirit!
Now & ever ..., О pure one who received the Joy of the angels in thy womb,
fill with joy my soul, which hath been downcast by mine evil deeds, and guide it to
the light.
