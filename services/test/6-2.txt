SUNDAY EVENING: TONE VI
AT VESPERS
On “Lord, I have cried ...”, 3 Stichera of repentance,
The composition of Joseph, in Tone VI:
Spec. Mel.: “The angelic hosts ...”:
Verse: If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, О Lord, О Lord, who shall
stand? * For with Thee there is forgiveness.
Through thought of contrition grant me tears of repentance, О Savior, that I
may wash away the filth from my soul, which I have badly sullied, committing
unrighteousness all the time, for it is for this that I have her who gave birth to
Thee, and the angelic choirs, entreating Thy love for mankind,
Verse: For Thy name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, О Lord; my
soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, * my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
Come, О my soul, and repent of the many sins thou hast committed in this
life, and entreat the multitude of the heavenly armies with sighs and tears, that
time be given thee for repentance, lest thou be sent into the most accursed fire of
Gehenna like the barren fig-tree.
Verse: From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch * let
Israel hope in the Lord.
Not one of Thy commandments have I kept on earth. When Thou shalt sit
upon Thy throne, how shall I give answer for myself, receiving condemnation for
all that I have done in knowledge or in ignorance, О my Christ? Wherefore, I cry
out to Thee: Through the supplications of Thy servants save me, the prodigal!
Then the Stichera for the saint, from the Menaion; or if there is no Menaion, these
Stichera for the holy incorporeal angels of heaven, in the same tone:
Spec. Mel.: “On the third day ...”:
Verse: For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him there is plenteous
redemption; * and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.
Standing before Thy throne, the angelic hosts pray for the race of mankind, О
Christ; wherefore, by their supplications grant peace unto all, and put down the
audacity of the heathen.
Verse: О praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise Him, all ye peoples.
О all ye ranks of the angels, who ever dance round about the throne of the
King of all, preserve us who call upon you with faith, and deliver us from
torments.
Verse: For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, * and the truth of
the Lord abideth forever.
The Father Who is God over all, the only Word, and the Spirit, brought forth
the hosts of heavenly intelligences, formless and immaterial, to hymn the glory of
the triple Sun.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
О Theotokos, who at the sound of the archangel’s voice conceived in thy
womb the Word, Who with the Father and the Spirit is equally beginningless, thou
hast been revealed to be more exalted than the cherubim, seraphim and thrones.
Then, “О Joyous Light ...”, the Prokeimenon in Tone VIII:
Prokeimenon: Behold now, bless ye the Lord, * all ye servants of the Lord.
Verse: Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of
our God.
Vouchsafe, О Lord ..., Litany: Let us complete ..., Then:
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone VI:
At Thy dread coming, О Christ, let us not hear “I know you not.” For we have
set our hope upon Thee, О Savior. And even though in our neglect we have not
kept Thy precepts, yet take pity on our souls, we pray.
Verse: Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, unto Thee that dwellest in
heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hands of their
masters, as the eyes of the handmaid look unto the hands of her mistress,
so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, * until He take pity on us.
Neither repentance nor tears have I acquired; wherefore, I beseech Thee, О
Christ God: Convert me before the end, and grant me compunction, that I may be
delivered from tortures.
Verse: Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for greatly are we
filled with abasement. Greatly hath our soul been filled therewith; let
reproach come upon them that prosper, * and abasement on the proud.
To the Martyrs: Thy martyrs, O Lord, denied Thee not, nor did they forsake
Thy commandments; by their intercessions have mercy upon us.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
Like the Archangel, * let us the faithful hymn the bridal-chamber of heaven, *
the portal truly sealed: * Rejoice, for whose sake hath budded forth unto us Christ
the Savior of all, * the Bestower of life and God! * With thine arm O Lady * cast
down the tyrants, our godless foes, * O most pure one, ** O thou hope of
Christians! 
Then, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart ...”, Trisagion through Our
Father ..., Troparia. Litany: Have mercy on us ..., and Dismissal.

their pursuer Pharaoh drowned, * they cried: * Let us sing to God * a song
of victory.
Drive the cloud of the passions from my mind, О pure one, and shine light
upon me, О most pure one who hast given birth to the Son, the Effulgence of the
Father, that I may hymn thee.

pure one; wherefore, we, the faithful, cry out to thee: Rejoice!

exalted the horn of The faithful O good One, * and strengthened us upon
the rock * of Thy confession.

birth to the Creator and Master of all things; wherefore, all of us, the faithful, cry
out to thee in thanksgiving: Rejoice!
The cruel waves of the passions buffet me, О pure one, and I am truly cast
into the abyss of evils by my many bitter falls. О pure one, extend to me a helping
hand, and save me.
Glory ..., Break through the darkness of my transgressions, О Virgin, and
shine upon me the light of dispassion, О pure one who ineffably hast given birth
to the intangible Sun.
Now & ever ..., Having cleansed me of transgressions and defilement with the
fire of the fear of God, О Maiden, clothe me in the radiant vesture of the virtues
and set me among the choirs of the saints.

divinely singeth, * crying with a pure mind, * keeping festival in the Lord.
With thy radiance dispel the gloom of my many transgressions, О most
immaculate Lady who hast given birth to the Light, Who hast shone upon the
faithful the Sun of righteousness.

and love have recourse to thy temple, and deliver us from all temptations and

those who with love rise early to pray to Thee, * that they may know Thee,
O Word of God, * as the true God, * Who recalleth us from the darkness of
sin.
With the divine radiance of Him who shone forth from thy womb do thou
illumine my soul which sleepeth in darkness, О Virgin, and drive away the
darkness of sin, illumining me with thy light.
Heal thou my soul, which hath fallen among thieves, О good one, pouring
forth the oil of mercy and the wine of thy tenderheartedness upon my wounds,
granting me abundant understanding.
Glory ..., Heal thou the infirmities of flesh and soul of us who have recourse
to thee, О all-hymned one; for thou art the strength of those who flee beneath the
shelter of thy supplication, O Birthgiver of God.
Now & ever ..., The Holy Spirit of God, dwelling within thy womb, О most
pure one, and overshadowing thee, showed thee to be the habitation of the
Trinity, for at the Father’s good pleasure thou didst conceive the Son and give
birth unto Him.
ODE VI
Irmos: Beholding the sea of life surging with the tempest of temptations, *
I run to Thy calm haven, and cry to Thee: * Raise up my life from
corruption, * O Most Merciful One.
Dispel the gloom, of mine accursed soul, and shine upon me the light which
shone forth from thy womb illumining all human nature, О most pure one.
Deliver me from the assaults of enemies visible and invisible, О pure one, and
grant me the mighty shelter of thine aid; for to thee, О Virgin, have I now fled.

in the latter days and, setting aright human nature, which had grievously fallen
through Adam, He hath restored the world.

preserving my heart in peace.
Lord, have mercy, (Thrice).
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Sessional hymn, in Tone VI:
The attacks of the adversary assail thine inheritance, О Lady. Set at naught
their scheming, and cast their prideful arrogance down to the ground; for thou art
the ally of those who entreat thee with faith.
ODE VII
Irmos: An Angel made the furnace bedew the holy Children. * But the
command of God consumed the Chaldeans * and prevailed upon the tyrant
to cry: * O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou.
Shedding unapproachable light upon me who am in the darkness of ignorance,
О most pure one, guide me to the Light, that I may piously cry out to thy Son
with faith: Blessed is the God of our fathers!
Drive the cloud of gloom from my soul, О Birthgiver of God, illumining me
with the light of the Creator of all; for thou art the receptacle of the pre-eternal
Light Who shone forth dispassionately from the Father.
Glory ..., Incline thyself to our pleas, О pure Birthgiver of God, and in thy
mercy be thou moved to entreat God, rendering Him merciful to us who ever
place our hope in thee, О good one.
Now & ever ..., Grant cleansing unto me who am defiled by the passions of
wicked deeds, О pure one, and send me tear-drops to wash away the evil shame of
my sin, the outpouring of filth.
ODE VIII
Irmos: Thou didst make flame bedew the holy children, * and didst burn
the sacrifice of a righteous man with water. * For Thou alone, O Christ,
dost do all as Thou willest, * Thee do we supremely exalt throughout all
ages.
О Maiden who hast given birth to the Master of all in the flesh, rescue me
from the violence of the passions, and unite me to the Creator of all by love, that I
may hymn Him throughout all ages.
By thy visitation, О Maiden, raise me up who lie upon the bed of pain, and
grant health of body and soul unto me who hymn Christ throughout all ages.

exalted Him.

expectation upon thee, О good one; for thou dost ever help, saving those who
praise thee from misfortunes.

Angels dare not gaze; * but through thee, O all-pure one, * did the Word
Incarnate become a man * and with the Heavenly Hosts * Him we magnify
and thee we call blessed.
From all manner of evils deliver me who have recourse to thee with faith, О
most pure Virgin, and grant health and deliverance from the wicked unto me who
flee to thy protection, О Maiden, that I may ever glorify thee with cries of
thanksgiving.
Thou hast abolished the curse of grief, О pure one, and hast poured forth joy
upon the world through thy birthgiving, having borne the Well-spring of blessing.
Wherefore, praising thee, the all-hymned one, all of us, the faithful, ever bless thee
with thanksgiving.
Glory ..., Thy womb became a receptacle of the Light Who shone forth from
the Father before all ages, О all-hymned Birthgiver of God; wherefore, we all
glorify thee, the Theotokos, and magnify Him as thy Son and God.

to the Judge? О compassionate Father, only-begotten Son and Holy Spirit: Have
mercy on me!
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.
In the vale of weeping, in the place which Thou hast appointed, rebuke me
not, О Merciful One, when Thou shalt come to render just judgment, neither
shame me before the angels; but take pity on me, О God, and have mercy on me.
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
With heart and mouth let us hymn aloud the most glorious Mother of God,
who is holier than the holy angels, confessing her to be the Theotokos, in that she
truly gave birth to God incarnate, and prayeth unceasingly on behalf of our souls.

Have mercy on us, О Lord, have mercy on us, for at a loss for any plea, we
sinners offer Thee our Master this supplication: Have mercy on us!
Verse: О Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, * nor chasten me in Thy
wrath.
Have mercy on us, О Lord, for we have placed our hope in Thee. Be not
angry with us greatly, neither remember Thou our iniquities; but look upon us
now, as Thou art compassionate, and deliver us from our enemies. For Thou art
our God, and we are Thy people. We are all the work of Thy hands, and we call
upon Thy name.
Verse: Wondrous is God in His saints, * the God of Israel
To the Martyrs: Ever enlightened by Thee, and having extinguished the lamp
of the infidels, like lamps the saints always shine forth light upon the righteous.
Through their supplications, О our Savior, light Thou my lamp, and save me, О
Lord.

judgment, and tremble, for I have committed a multitude offenses. But converting
me before the end, save me, in that Thou art a merciful God, through the
supplications of Thine angels, О only Compassionate Lover of mankind.
О soul who hast spent thy whole life in slothfulness, unmindful of the day of
dread judgment: Come to thy senses, and repent, and turn back and cry out to
Christ: О Compassionate One, at the hour of condemnation be not mindful of
our many offenses!
Glory ..., Now & ever ..., Theotokion:
O good Birthgiver of God, hope, protection and haven of those who trust in

Israel, crossing through the midst of the sea, * cried aloud exclaiming: *
Let us chant unto the Lord God, * for He hath been glorified!
Treating me with the oil of mercy, who have fallen into the hands of thieves
and been half slain by soul-corrupting wounds, О Christ, have pity on me, that I

I have sinned greatly, and become a den of thieves. О Christ Who wast born
in a cave, grant me an outpouring of tears, and cleanse me, that I may become a
temple for Thy Holy Spirit.
To the Martyrs: Having like youths cast down the enemy, О spiritual athletes,
ye have truly been adorned with divinely plaited wreaths, and, full of glory, stand

their pursuer Pharaoh drowned, * they cried: * Let us sing to God * a song
of victory.
I praise the beauteous majesty of the heavenly choirs, and cry aloud: I pray
Thee, О Christ, Who alone art compassionate, may I be illumined by their radiant
lightning. (Twice)
Thou Who by Thy word and the most Holy Spirit adorned all things and the
angelic choirs which Thou didst create, Thou hast created them to hymn Thee as

I do, who am beset by great blindness? О Son of God, have pity on me!
Having wasted my life in slothfulness, wretch that I am, I consider the longsuffering of God; and I am afraid that the severing of death will suddenly overtake
me.
To the Martyrs: Desiring persecutions, pangs and tribulations as though they
were food, the martyrs rejoiced, looking toward to everlasting delight with their
neotic eyes.

evil, deified for the primal and good ascent.

bedew the burning furnace: * О Lord God of our fathers blessed art Thou!
I have been blinded in mind by grave evil, and have not looked upon the light
of repentance. О Christ my Savior, save me!
Trusting in thy tender compassion, I fall down before Thee, О Compassionate
One, and ask for remission of mine evils. Disdain me not, О Master!
To the Martyrs: О my Christ, Who dost invest with heavenly glory those who
suffer for Thee in the world: By their supplications save me.

command of God consumed the Chaldeans * and prevailed upon the tyrant
to cry: * O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou.

luminous by the beauty of the Almighty, and with love they ever sing unto Him:
Blessed art Thou, О God, throughout the ages! (Twice)
Noetically revolving round about Thee, О Master, the angels eternally receive
Thine effulgence transcending understanding, ever chanting and saying: Blessed
art Thou, О God, throughout the ages!
Theotokion: The incorporeal archangel said: “O blessed one, the Lord is with
thee!” For, desiring to restore corrupted nature, He made His abode within thy
womb, О blessed one who hast given birth to God in the flesh.
ODE VIII
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: Thy venerable Children in the furnace * likened to the cherubim *
chanted the thrice-holy hymn * Bless ye, praise ye and supremely exalt ye
the Lord throughout all ages.
In my conduct I have emulated the rich man’s lack of mercy. Overlooking
mine impoverished mind, О Christ, send me not into the unquenchable fire, who
stand before the gates of repentance corrupted by evil.
From this life send me not, who am unprepared, into the wintry sabbath, the
idle lack of good deeds, О Compassionate One Who easeth the winter of sin; but
grant me divine conversion.
To the Martyrs: Trampling down deceptive falsehood by faith, the martyrs
endured the threefold waves of tortures in every way, blessing, hymning and
exalting Christ throughout the ages.
To the Martyrs: Extinguishing the burning flame of torments with the dew of
patience, ye utterly consumed the tinder of ungodliness, afire with the zeal of
divine love, О holy and right victorious martyrs.
Theotokion: As higher in honor than the angels, and having been
magnificently sanctified, О Virgin Theotokos, thou hast given birth to the most
holy God; wherefore, sanctify my soul.
Canon of the Angels
Irmos: Thou didst make flame bedew the holy children, * and didst burn
the sacrifice of a righteous man with water. * For Thou alone, O Christ,
dost do all as Thou willest, * Thee do we supremely exalt throughout all
ages.
As of old Thou didst protect Elisha, Thy favored one, with armies of
incorporeal beings, О Christ, so now encompass the Church which exalteth Thee
supremely, throughout the ages. (Twice)
О divine chief commanders, as ye stand before the dread throne, pray that
those who with love glorify and exalt Christ throughout all ages may be delivered
from transgressions.
Theotokion: О divinely joyous one, with the divine Gabriel we cry “Rejoice!”
to thee, the Mother and Virgin; since for our sake thou hast given birth in the
flesh to the Word of God, Whom we exalt supremely throughout all ages.
We then chant the Hymn of the Theotokos (the Magnificat), with the
refrain: “More honorable than the cherubim ...”, and make prostrations.
ODE IX
Canon of Repentance
Irmos: О Virgin who received the angel’s salutation * and hast given birth
to thine own Creator, * save those who magnify thee.
Having maintained his chastity, Joseph was appointed distributor of grain; but
I, who commit fornication, am beset by a famine of virtuous deeds.
Repenting like Peter, О Christ, I offer up tears; I sigh like the publican, and
like the prodigal son I cry out from the depths of my heart: I have sinned! Forgive
me!
To the Martyrs: With Christ as your ally, ye cast down the evil of the enemy, О
most wise ones, and received crowns of victory from on high.
To the Martyrs: Through the Holy Spirit the holy memorial of all the martyrs
sanctifieth those who hallow it in an Orthodox manner.
Theotokion: О thou who hast given birth to the Light of dispassion, enlighten
me who have been darkened by sins, that I may hymn thee, О pure Ever-virgin.
Canon of the Angels
Irmos: It is impossible for mankind to see God * upon Whom the orders of
Angels dare not gaze; * but through thee, O all-pure one, * did the Word
Incarnate become a man * and with the Heavenly Hosts * Him we magnify
and thee we call blessed.
In that for the sake of Thy prophet David Thou didst cause Thine angel, who
was cutting down Thy people, to desist, so also, in that Thou art compassionate,
О Christ, grant peace to all the Churches, easing the temptations which now
afflict them, in that Thou art greatly merciful. (Twice)
Seeing the afflictions of Thy people, О Christ Master, as the Physician of souls
and bodies heal them, through the supplications of Thy ministers, who now stand
round about Thee, the King of all, and with constant cries glorify Thee as God.
Theotokion: Honoring now thine exceedingly glorious birthgiving, О Virgin
Mother, the principalities, archangels, dominions and seraphim, the powers,
authorities, thrones and cherubim ever reverently glorify thee.
Then, “It is truly meet to bless thee ...”, and a prostration.
Litany: Let us complete ..., Exapostilarion, and the usual psalms.
On the Aposticha, the Stichera of repentance, in Tone VI:
Finding me naked, and stripped of virtues, the enemy hath wounded me with
the arrow of sin; but, do Thou as the Physician of both soul and body, heal the
wounds of my soul O God, and have mercy on me.
Verse: We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, О Lord, and we
rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein
Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon
Thy servants, and upon Thy works, * and do Thou guide their sons.
The wounds of my heart, inflicted on me by my many sins, do Thou heal O
