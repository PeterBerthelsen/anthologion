  <h3>Psalm 102</h3>
  <p>Bless the Lord, o my soul; blessed art Thou, O Lord. * Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless His holy name. * Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all that He hath done for thee. * Who is gracious unto all thine iniquities, Who healeth all thine infirmities. * Who redeemeth thy life from corruption, Who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion. * Who fulfilleth thy desire with good things; thy youth shall be renewed as the eagle's. * The Lord performeth deeds of mercy, and executeth judgment for all them that are wronged. * He hath made His ways known unto Moses, unto the sons of Israel the things that He hath willed. * Compassionate and merciful is the Lord, long-suffering and plenteous in mercy. * Not unto the end will He be angered, neither unto eternity will He be wroth. * Not according to our iniquities hath He dealt with us, neither according to our sins hath He rewarded us. * For according to the height of heaven from the earth, the Lord hath made His mercy to prevail over them that fear Him. * As far as the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our iniquities from us. * Like as a father hath compassion upon his sons, so hath the Lord had compassion upon them that fear Him; * for He knoweth whereof we are made, He hath remembered that we are dust. * As for man, his days are as the grass; as a flower of the field, so shall he blossom forth. * For when the wind is passed over it, then it shall be gone, and no longer will it know the place thereof. * But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity, even unto eternity, upon them that fear Him. * And His righteousness is upon sons of sons, upon them that keep His testament and remember His commandments to do them. * The Lord in heaven hath prepared His throne, and His kingdom ruleth over all. * Bless the Lord, all ye His angels, mighty in strength, that perform His word, to hear the voice of His words. * Bless the Lord, all ye His hosts, His ministers that do His will. *</p>
  <p>Bless the Lord, all ye His works, in every place of His dominion.</p>
  <p>Glory to the Father, * and to the Son, * and to the Holy Spirit. * Both now and ever, * and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
  <p>Bless the Lord, O my soul, * and all that is within me * bless His holy name; * blessed art Thou, O Lord.</p>
  <h3>Psalm 145</h3>
  <p>Glory to the Father, * and to the Son, * and to the Holy Spirit. * Praise the Lord, O my soul. I will praise the Lord in my life, I will chant unto my God for as long as I have my being. * Trust ye not in princes, in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation. * His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return unto his earth. In that day all his thoughts shall perish. * Blessed is he of whom the God of Jacob is his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God, * Who hath made heaven and the earth, the sea and all that is therein. * Who keepeth truth unto eternity, Who executeth judgment for the wronged, Who giveth food unto the hungry. * The Lord looseth the fettered; the Lord maketh wise the blind; the Lord setteth aright the fallen; * the Lord loveth the righteous; the Lord preserveth the proselytes. * He shall adopt for His own the orphan and widow, and the way of sinners shall He destroy. * The Lord shall be king unto eternity; thy God, O Zion, unto generation and generation.</p>
  <p>Both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. O only-begotten Son and Word of God, Who art immortal, yet didst deign for our salvation to be incarnate of the Holy Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary, and without change didst become man, and was crucified, O Christ God, trampling down death by death. Thou Who art one of the Holy Trinity, glorified with the Father and the Holy Spirit, save us.</p>

  <h3>The Symbol of Faith</h3>
  <p>I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages; Light of Light, true God of true God; begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made; Who for us men and for our salvation came down from the heavens, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man; And was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried; And arose again on the third day according to the Scriptures; And ascended into the heavens, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; And shall come again, with glory, to judge both the living and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life; Who proceedeth from the Father; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spake by the prophets. In One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead, And the life of the age to come. Amen. </p>
  <p>Remit, pardon, forgive, O God, our offenses, both voluntary and involuntary, in deed and word, in knowledge and ignorance, by day and by night, in mind and thought; forgive us all things, for Thou art good and the Lover of mankind.</p>
  <p>Our Father, Who art in the heavens, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.</p>
  <p>O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us. Amen.</p>

  <p>O All-Holy Trinity, the consubstantial dominion, the indivisible Kingdom, and cause of every Good: Show Thy good will even unto me a sinner; make steadfast my heart and grant it understanding, and take away mine every defilement; enlighten my mind that I may glorify, hymn, worship, and say:</p>
  <p>One is Holy, One is Lord, Jesus Christ, to the Glory of God the Father. Amen.</p>
  <p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
  <h3>Psalm 33</h3>
  <p>I will bless the Lord at all times, * His praise shall continually be in my mouth. *In the Lord shall my soul be praised; * let the meek hear and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, * and let us exalt His name together. * I sought the Lord, and He heard me, * and delivered me from all my tribulations. Come unto Him, and be enlightened, * and your faces shall not be ashamed. * This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, * and saved him out of all his tribulations. The angel of the Lord will encamp round about them that fear Him, * and will deliver them. * O taste and see that the Lord is good; * blessed is the man that hopeth in Him. O fear the Lord, all ye His saints; * for there is no want to them that fear Him. * Rich men have turned poor and gone hungry; * but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good thing. Come ye children, hearken unto me; * I will teach you the fear of the Lord. * What man is there that desireth life, * who loveth to see good days? Keep thy tongue from evil, * and thy lips from speaking guile. * Turn away from evil, and do good; * seek peace, and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, * and His ears are opened unto their supplication. * The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, * utterly to destroy the remembrance of them from the earth. The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them, * and He delivered them out of all their tribulations. * The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart, * and He will save the humble of spirit. * Many are the tribulations of the righteous, * and the Lord shall deliver them out of them all. * The Lord keepeth all their bones, * not one of them shall be broken. The death of sinners is evil, * and they that hate the righteous shall do wrong. * The Lord will redeem the souls of His servants, * and none of them will do wrong that hope in Him.</p>
  <p>It is truly meet to bless thee, the Theotokos, ever-blessed and most blameless, and Mother of Our God. More honorable than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, who without corruption gavest birth to God the Word, the very Theotokos, thee do we magnify.</p>
  <p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
